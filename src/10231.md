    net: renamings
    This is Go 1 package renaming CL #3.
    This one merely moves the source; the import strings will be
    changed after the next weekly release.
    This one moves pieces into net.
    
    http -> net/http
    http/cgi -> net/http/cgi
    http/fcgi -> net/http/fcgi
    http/pprof -> net/http/pprof
    http/httptest -> net/http/httptest
    mail -> net/mail
    rpc -> net/rpc
    rpc/jsonrpc -> net/rpc/jsonrpc
    smtp -> net/smtp
    url -> net/url
    
    Also remove rand (now math/rand) from NOTEST - it has a test.
    
    The only edits are in Makefiles and deps.bash.

## 元コミット内容

このコミットは、Go言語の標準ライブラリにおけるパッケージのリネーム、特に「Go 1パッケージリネームCL #3」とされています。主な目的は、ソースコードの物理的な移動であり、インポートパスの変更は次回の週次リリース後に行われる予定であることが明記されています。

具体的には、以下のパッケージが `net` パッケージのサブディレクトリとして移動されました。

*   `http` が `net/http` へ
*   `http/cgi` が `net/http/cgi` へ
*   `http/fcgi` が `net/http/fcgi` へ
*   `http/pprof` が `net/http/pprof` へ
*   `http/httptest` が `net/http/httptest` へ
*   `mail` が `net/mail` へ
*   `rpc` が `net/rpc` へ
*   `rpc/jsonrpc` が `net/rpc/jsonrpc` へ
*   `smtp` が `net/smtp` へ
*   `url` が `net/url` へ

また、`rand` パッケージ（現在は `math/rand`）が `NOTEST` リストから削除されました。これは、`rand` パッケージにテストが存在するため、テスト対象から除外する必要がなくなったことを意味します。

この変更は、主に `Makefiles` と `deps.bash` というビルド関連のファイルに限定されており、実際のGoソースコードの内容自体は移動に伴うパスの修正以外には変更されていません。

## 変更の背景

このコミットは、Go言語の最初の安定版リリースであるGo 1に向けた準備の一環として行われました。Go 1では、言語仕様の安定化だけでなく、標準ライブラリの構造も整理され、将来にわたって互換性を維持できるような設計が目指されました。

変更の主な背景は以下の通りです。

1.  **パッケージ構造の整理と一貫性**: Go言語の標準ライブラリは、初期の段階では様々な機能がトップレベルのパッケージとして存在していました。しかし、Go 1に向けて、関連性の高い機能を特定の親パッケージの下にまとめることで、ライブラリ全体の構造をより論理的で発見しやすいものにする必要がありました。特に、ネットワーク関連の機能は多岐にわたるため、これらを `net` パッケージの下に集約することは自然な流れでした。
2.  **インポートパスの安定化**: Go 1の重要な目標の一つは、将来のバージョンアップにおいても既存のコードが動作し続けるように、インポートパスを安定させることでした。このコミットのような大規模なパッケージ移動は、Go 1リリース前に行うことで、リリース後の破壊的変更を最小限に抑えるための戦略的な判断でした。コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述は、この段階では物理的なファイル移動のみを行い、実際にコード内のインポートパスを修正するのは後回しにすることで、段階的に変更を適用し、影響を評価する意図があったことを示唆しています。
3.  **ビルドシステムの適応**: パッケージの物理的な移動に伴い、ビルドシステムが正しく新しいパスを認識し、コンパイルやテストを実行できるように、`Makefile` や `deps.bash` といったビルド関連のファイルを更新する必要がありました。

## 前提知識の解説

このコミットを理解するためには、以下のGo言語および関連するビルドシステムの基本的な知識が必要です。

*   **Go言語のパッケージシステム**:
    *   Go言語では、コードは「パッケージ」という単位で整理されます。パッケージは、関連する機能や型、関数などをまとめたもので、再利用可能なコードの最小単位となります。
    *   パッケージはファイルシステム上のディレクトリに対応しており、ディレクトリ名がパッケージ名となることが一般的です。
    *   他のパッケージの機能を利用するには、`import` ステートメントを使ってそのパッケージをインポートします。インポートパスは、通常、Goのワークスペースの `src` ディレクトリからの相対パスで指定されます（例: `import "net/http"`）。
*   **Go 1リリース**:
    *   Go 1は、2012年3月にリリースされたGo言語の最初の安定版です。このリリースでは、言語仕様、標準ライブラリ、ツールチェインが安定化され、後方互換性が保証されるようになりました。
    *   Go 1以前は、言語やライブラリの仕様が頻繁に変更される可能性がありましたが、Go 1以降は、既存のGo 1コードが将来のGoバージョンでも動作することが保証されています。このコミットは、Go 1の安定化プロセスの一環として行われたものです。
*   **`Makefile`**:
    *   `Makefile` は、Unix系のシステムでプログラムのビルドプロセスを自動化するためのファイルです。`make` コマンドによって解釈され、ソースコードのコンパイル、リンク、テストなどのタスクを実行するためのルールが記述されています。
    *   Go言語の初期のビルドシステムでは、`Makefile` が標準ライブラリのビルドにも広く利用されていました。このコミットでは、パッケージの移動に伴い、`Makefile` 内のディレクトリリスト (`DIRS`) やインクルードパスが更新されています。
*   **`deps.bash`**:
    *   `deps.bash` は、Go言語のビルドシステムの一部として使用されていたシェルスクリプトで、主に依存関係の解決やパスの変換を処理していました。
    *   このファイルは、Goのパッケージがビルドされる際に、古いインポートパスを新しいインポートパスにマッピングする役割を担っていました。コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述は、この `deps.bash` が一時的に古いパスを新しいパスに変換することで、ソースコード内のインポートパスの変更を遅らせることを可能にしていたことを示唆しています。
*   **`NOTEST` リスト**:
    *   `Makefile` 内に存在する可能性のあるリストで、ビルド時にテストを実行しないパッケージを指定するために使用されます。このコミットでは、`rand` パッケージが `NOTEST` から削除されており、これは `rand` パッケージにテストが追加されたか、テストの実行方法が変更されたことを意味します。

## 技術的詳細

このコミットの技術的な詳細は、主にファイルシステムの変更とビルドスクリプトの調整に集約されます。

1.  **パッケージの物理的な移動**:
    *   `src/pkg/http` ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ（`cgi`, `fcgi`, `pprof`, `httptest`）が `src/pkg/net/http` 以下に移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/mail` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/mail` へ移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/rpc` ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ（`jsonrpc`）が `src/pkg/net/rpc` 以下に移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/smtp` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/smtp` へ移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/url` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/url` へ移動されました。
    *   これらの移動は、`git` の `rename` 操作として記録されており、ファイルの履歴が保持されています。多くのファイルで `similarity index 100%` と表示されているのは、ファイルの内容自体は変更されず、パスのみが変更されたことを示しています。

2.  **`src/pkg/Makefile` の変更**:
    *   `DIRS` 変数から、移動前のパッケージパス（例: `http`, `mail`, `rpc`, `smtp`, `url`）が削除されました。
    *   `DIRS` 変数に、移動後の新しいパッケージパス（例: `net/http`, `net/http/cgi`, `net/mail`, `net/rpc`, `net/smtp`, `net/url`）が追加されました。これにより、ビルドシステムが新しい場所にあるパッケージを認識し、ビルド対象に含めることができます。
    *   `NOTEST` 変数から `http/pprof` と `http/httptest` が削除され、代わりに `net/http/pprof` と `net/http/httptest` が追加されました。これは、これらのパッケージが新しいパスに移動した後も、引き続きテスト対象から除外されることを意味します（ただし、`rand` は `NOTEST` から完全に削除されました）。

3.  **`src/pkg/deps.bash` の変更**:
    *   このスクリプトは、Goのビルドプロセスにおいて、パッケージの依存関係を解決し、インポートパスを変換する役割を担っていました。
    *   変更点を見ると、古いパッケージ名（例: `http`, `mail`, `rpc`, `smtp`, `url`）に対応する正規表現パターンが追加され、それらが新しい `net` プレフィックス付きのパス（例: `net/http`, `net/mail`）にマッピングされるように `sed` コマンドのルールが追加されています。
    *   これは、コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述と一致します。つまり、この `deps.bash` の変更によって、ソースコード内のインポートパスがまだ古いままであっても、ビルド時には新しいパスに解決されるように一時的な対応がなされていたと考えられます。

4.  **個々の `Makefile` のパス修正**:
    *   移動された各パッケージ内の `Makefile` ファイルも更新されています。例えば、`src/pkg/http/Makefile` が `src/pkg/net/http/Makefile` にリネームされ、その内容も変更されています。
    *   変更内容は、`include ../../Make.inc` や `include ../../Make.pkg` といった共通のビルド設定ファイルへの相対パスが、パッケージの階層が深くなったことに合わせて `../../../Make.inc` や `../../../Make.pkg` のように修正されています。これは、`Makefile` が自身の位置から共通ファイルへの正しいパスを見つけられるようにするための調整です。

## コアとなるコードの変更箇所

このコミットにおける「コアとなるコードの変更箇所」は、Go言語のソースコードそのものというよりも、Goのビルドシステムとパッケージ構造を定義するファイル群です。

具体的には、以下のファイルが主要な変更箇所となります。

*   **`src/pkg/Makefile`**: Go標準ライブラリ全体のビルドを管理する主要なMakefile。パッケージのディレクトリリスト (`DIRS`) とテスト対象外リスト (`NOTEST`) が更新されました。
*   **`src/pkg/deps.bash`**: Goのビルドプロセスにおける依存関係解決とインポートパス変換を担うシェルスクリプト。古いパッケージパスから新しいパッケージパスへのマッピングルールが追加されました。
*   **各パッケージの `Makefile` ファイル**:
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{mail => net/http/cgi}/Makefile` (これは `mail/Makefile` が `net/http/cgi/Makefile` にリネームされたことを示唆しており、興味深い点です。実際には `mail/Makefile` は `net/mail/Makefile` にリネームされ、`http/cgi/Makefile` は `net/http/cgi/Makefile` にリネームされています。diffの表示が少し紛らわしいですが、実態はそれぞれのパッケージのMakefileが移動先に合わせてリネームされ、内容が修正されています。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/fcgi/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/httptest/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{smtp => net/http/pprof}/Makefile` (これも同様に、`smtp/Makefile` が `net/http/pprof/Makefile` にリネームされたように見えますが、実際にはそれぞれのMakefileが移動先にリネームされています。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/rpc/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/rpc/jsonrpc/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{http/pprof => net/smtp}/Makefile` (これも同様です。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/url/Makefile`

これらの `Makefile` ファイルでは、`include` ディレクティブで指定されている共通のビルド設定ファイル (`Make.inc`, `Make.pkg`) への相対パスが、パッケージの新しい階層構造に合わせて修正されています。

Goソースコードファイル自体（例: `src/pkg/http/client.go` が `src/pkg/net/http/client.go` にリネームされたものなど）は、内容の変更は伴わず、単にファイルパスが変更されただけです。これは `similarity index 100%` で示されています。

## コアとなるコードの解説

このコミットの「コアとなるコード」は、Go言語の標準ライブラリのビルドと構造を定義するメタデータとスクリプトです。

*   **`src/pkg/Makefile` の役割**:
    *   このファイルは、Goの標準ライブラリに含まれるすべてのパッケージを列挙し、それらをビルドするための全体的な指示を提供します。`DIRS` 変数にパッケージのパスを追加することで、`make` コマンドがそれらのパッケージをビルド対象として認識します。
    *   今回の変更では、古いトップレベルのパッケージパスが削除され、`net/` プレフィックスを持つ新しいパスが追加されました。これにより、ビルドシステムは新しいディレクトリ構造に従ってパッケージをビルドするようになります。
    *   `NOTEST` リストの更新は、特定のパッケージのテストをスキップするかどうかを制御します。`rand` が削除されたことは、そのテストが安定し、通常通り実行されるようになったことを示唆しています。

*   **`src/pkg/deps.bash` の役割**:
    *   このスクリプトは、Goのビルドプロセスにおいて、パッケージのインポートパスの解決と変換を行うための重要な役割を担っていました。
    *   Go 1リリース前は、パッケージのパスが頻繁に変更される可能性があったため、ソースコード内の `import` ステートメントをすぐに更新するのではなく、ビルド時に `deps.bash` を使って古いパスを新しいパスに「リダイレクト」するような仕組みが採用されていました。
    *   このコミットで `deps.bash` に追加された `sed` ルールは、まさにこの目的のために機能します。例えば、`http.install` という古いインポートパスが `net/http.install` に変換されることで、ソースコードがまだ `import "http"` と記述していても、ビルド時には `net/http` パッケージが参照されるようになります。これは、大規模なリファクタリングを段階的に、かつ安全に進めるための巧妙な戦略でした。

*   **個々の `Makefile` のパス修正の役割**:
    *   各パッケージディレクトリ内の `Makefile` は、そのパッケージ固有のビルド設定（ターゲット名、ソースファイルリストなど）を定義します。
    *   これらの `Makefile` が `Make.inc` や `Make.pkg` といった共通のビルドスクリプトを `include` する際に、正しい相対パスを指定することが不可欠です。パッケージが `src/pkg/http` から `src/pkg/net/http` へと1階層深くなったため、`../../Make.inc` は `../../../Make.inc` に変更する必要がありました。この修正は、ビルドシステムが共通のビルド設定を正しく読み込めるようにするために必要不可欠な変更です。

これらの変更は、Go言語の標準ライブラリがGo 1として安定し、将来にわたってメンテナンスしやすい構造を持つための基盤を築いたと言えます。特に、ネットワーク関連の機能が `net` パッケージの下に集約されたことは、Goのネットワークプログラミングにおける一貫性と直感性を高める上で重要な一歩でした。

    net: renamings
    This is Go 1 package renaming CL #3.
    This one merely moves the source; the import strings will be
    changed after the next weekly release.
    This one moves pieces into net.
    
    http -> net/http
    http/cgi -> net/http/cgi
    http/fcgi -> net/http/fcgi
    http/pprof -> net/http/pprof
    http/httptest -> net/http/httptest
    mail -> net/mail
    rpc -> net/rpc
    rpc/jsonrpc -> net/rpc/jsonrpc
    smtp -> net/smtp
    url -> net/url
    
    Also remove rand (now math/rand) from NOTEST - it has a test.
    
    The only edits are in Makefiles and deps.bash.

https://github.com/golang/go/commit/de03d502c7e0bd07c6f084ed9b5bb0446df29b49

## 元コミット内容

このコミットは、Go言語の標準ライブラリにおけるパッケージのリネーム（名称変更および移動）に関するもので、特に「Go 1パッケージリネームCL #3」とされています。主な目的は、ソースコードの物理的な移動であり、インポートパスの変更は次回の週次リリース後に行われる予定であることが明記されています。

具体的には、以下のパッケージが `net` パッケージのサブディレクトリとして移動されました。

*   `http` が `net/http` へ
*   `http/cgi` が `net/http/cgi` へ
*   `http/fcgi` が `net/http/fcgi` へ
*   `http/pprof` が `net/http/pprof` へ
*   `http/httptest` が `net/http/httptest` へ
*   `mail` が `net/mail` へ
*   `rpc` が `net/rpc` へ
*   `rpc/jsonrpc` が `net/rpc/jsonrpc` へ
*   `smtp` が `net/smtp` へ
*   `url` が `net/url` へ

また、`rand` パッケージ（現在は `math/rand`）が `NOTEST` リストから削除されました。これは、`rand` パッケージにテストが存在するため、テスト対象から除外する必要がなくなったことを意味します。

この変更は、主に `Makefiles` と `deps.bash` というビルド関連のファイルに限定されており、実際のGoソースコードの内容自体は移動に伴うパスの修正以外には変更されていません。

## 変更の背景

このコミットは、Go言語の最初の安定版リリースであるGo 1に向けた準備の一環として行われました。Go 1では、言語仕様の安定化だけでなく、標準ライブラリの構造も整理され、将来にわたって互換性を維持できるような設計が目指されました。

変更の主な背景は以下の通りです。

1.  **パッケージ構造の整理と一貫性**: Go言語の標準ライブラリは、初期の段階では様々な機能がトップレベルのパッケージとして存在していました。しかし、Go 1に向けて、関連性の高い機能を特定の親パッケージの下にまとめることで、ライブラリ全体の構造をより論理的で発見しやすいものにする必要がありました。特に、ネットワーク関連の機能は多岐にわたるため、これらを `net` パッケージの下に集約することは自然な流れでした。
2.  **インポートパスの安定化**: Go 1の重要な目標の一つは、将来のバージョンアップにおいても既存のコードが動作し続けるように、インポートパスを安定させることでした。このコミットのような大規模なパッケージ移動は、Go 1リリース前に行うことで、リリース後の破壊的変更を最小限に抑えるための戦略的な判断でした。コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述は、この段階では物理的なファイル移動のみを行い、実際にコード内のインポートパスを修正するのは後回しにすることで、段階的に変更を適用し、影響を評価する意図があったことを示唆しています。
3.  **ビルドシステムの適応**: パッケージの物理的な移動に伴い、ビルドシステムが正しく新しいパスを認識し、コンパイルやテストを実行できるように、`Makefile` や `deps.bash` といったビルド関連のファイルを更新する必要がありました。

## 前提知識の解説

このコミットを理解するためには、以下のGo言語および関連するビルドシステムの基本的な知識が必要です。

*   **Go言語のパッケージシステム**:
    *   Go言語では、コードは「パッケージ」という単位で整理されます。パッケージは、関連する機能や型、関数などをまとめたもので、再利用可能なコードの最小単位となります。
    *   パッケージはファイルシステム上のディレクトリに対応しており、ディレクトリ名がパッケージ名となることが一般的です。
    *   他のパッケージの機能を利用するには、`import` ステートメントを使ってそのパッケージをインポートします。インポートパスは、通常、Goのワークスペースの `src` ディレクトリからの相対パスで指定されます（例: `import "net/http"`）。
*   **Go 1リリース**:
    *   Go 1は、2012年3月にリリースされたGo言語の最初の安定版です。このリリースでは、言語仕様、標準ライブラリ、ツールチェインが安定化され、後方互換性が保証されるようになりました。
    *   Go 1以前は、言語やライブラリの仕様が頻繁に変更される可能性がありましたが、Go 1以降は、既存のGo 1コードが将来のGoバージョンでも動作することが保証されています。このコミットは、Go 1の安定化プロセスの一環として行われたものです。
*   **`Makefile`**:
    *   `Makefile` は、Unix系のシステムでプログラムのビルドプロセスを自動化するためのファイルです。`make` コマンドによって解釈され、ソースコードのコンパイル、リンク、テストなどのタスクを実行するためのルールが記述されています。
    *   Go言語の初期のビルドシステムでは、`Makefile` が標準ライブラリのビルドにも広く利用されていました。このコミットでは、パッケージの移動に伴い、`Makefile` 内のディレクトリリスト (`DIRS`) やインクルードパスが更新されています。
*   **`deps.bash`**:
    *   `deps.bash` は、Go言語のビルドシステムの一部として使用されていたシェルスクリプトで、主に依存関係の解決やパスの変換を処理していました。
    *   このファイルは、Goのパッケージがビルドされる際に、古いインポートパスを新しいインポートパスにマッピングする役割を担っていました。コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述は、この `deps.bash` が一時的に古いパスを新しいパスに変換することで、ソースコード内のインポートパスの変更を遅らせることを可能にしていたことを示唆しています。
*   **`NOTEST` リスト**:
    *   `Makefile` 内に存在する可能性のあるリストで、ビルド時にテストを実行しないパッケージを指定するために使用されます。このコミットでは、`rand` パッケージが `NOTEST` から削除されており、これは `rand` パッケージにテストが追加されたか、テストの実行方法が変更されたことを意味します。

## 技術的詳細

このコミットの技術的な詳細は、主にファイルシステムの変更とビルドスクリプトの調整に集約されます。

1.  **パッケージの物理的な移動**:
    *   `src/pkg/http` ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ（`cgi`, `fcgi`, `pprof`, `httptest`）が `src/pkg/net/http` 以下に移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/mail` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/mail` へ移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/rpc` ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ（`jsonrpc`）が `src/pkg/net/rpc` 以下に移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/smtp` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/smtp` へ移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/url` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/url` へ移動されました。
    *   これらの移動は、`git` の `rename` 操作として記録されており、ファイルの履歴が保持されています。多くのファイルで `similarity index 100%` と表示されているのは、ファイルの内容自体は変更されず、パスのみが変更されたことを示しています。

2.  **`src/pkg/Makefile` の変更**:
    *   `DIRS` 変数から、移動前のパッケージパス（例: `http`, `mail`, `rpc`, `smtp`, `url`）が削除されました。
    *   `DIRS` 変数に、移動後の新しいパッケージパス（例: `net/http`, `net/http/cgi`, `net/mail`, `net/rpc`, `net/smtp`, `net/url`）が追加されました。これにより、ビルドシステムが新しい場所にあるパッケージを認識し、ビルド対象に含めることができます。
    *   `NOTEST` 変数から `http/pprof` と `http/httptest` が削除され、代わりに `net/http/pprof` と `net/http/httptest` が追加されました。これは、これらのパッケージが新しいパスに移動した後も、引き続きテスト対象から除外されることを意味します（ただし、`rand` は `NOTEST` から完全に削除されました）。

3.  **`src/pkg/deps.bash` の変更**:
    *   このスクリプトは、Goのビルドプロセスにおいて、パッケージの依存関係を解決し、インポートパスを変換する役割を担っていました。
    *   変更点を見ると、古いパッケージ名（例: `http`, `mail`, `rpc`, `smtp`, `url`）に対応する正規表現パターンが追加され、それらが新しい `net` プレフィックス付きのパス（例: `net/http`, `net/mail`）にマッピングされるように `sed` コマンドのルールが追加されています。
    *   これは、コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述と一致します。つまり、この `deps.bash` の変更によって、ソースコード内のインポートパスがまだ古いままであっても、ビルド時には新しいパスに解決されるように一時的な対応がなされていたと考えられます。

4.  **個々の `Makefile` のパス修正**:
    *   移動された各パッケージ内の `Makefile` ファイルも更新されています。例えば、`src/pkg/http/Makefile` が `src/pkg/net/http/Makefile` にリネームされ、その内容も変更されています。
    *   変更内容は、`include ../../Make.inc` や `include ../../Make.pkg` といった共通のビルド設定ファイルへの相対パスが、パッケージの階層が深くなったことに合わせて `../../../Make.inc` や `../../../Make.pkg` のように修正されています。これは、`Makefile` が自身の位置から共通ファイルへの正しいパスを見つけられるようにするための調整です。

## コアとなるコードの変更箇所

このコミットにおける「コアとなるコードの変更箇所」は、Go言語のソースコードそのものというよりも、Goのビルドシステムとパッケージ構造を定義するファイル群です。

具体的には、以下のファイルが主要な変更箇所となります。

*   **`src/pkg/Makefile`**: Go標準ライブラリ全体のビルドを管理する主要なMakefile。パッケージのディレクトリリスト (`DIRS`) とテスト対象外リスト (`NOTEST`) が更新されました。
*   **`src/pkg/deps.bash`**: Goのビルドプロセスにおける依存関係解決とインポートパス変換を担うシェルスクリプト。古いパッケージパスから新しいパッケージパスへのマッピングルールが追加されました。
*   **各パッケージの `Makefile` ファイル**:
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{mail => net/http/cgi}/Makefile` (これは `mail/Makefile` が `net/http/cgi/Makefile` にリネームされたことを示唆しており、興味深い点です。実際には `mail/Makefile` は `net/mail/Makefile` にリネームされ、`http/cgi/Makefile` は `net/http/cgi/Makefile` にリネームされています。diffの表示が少し紛らわしいですが、実態はそれぞれのパッケージのMakefileが移動先に合わせてリネームされ、内容が修正されています。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/fcgi/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/httptest/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{smtp => net/http/pprof}/Makefile` (これも同様に、`smtp/Makefile` が `net/http/pprof/Makefile` にリネームされたように見えますが、実際にはそれぞれのMakefileが移動先にリネームされています。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/rpc/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/rpc/jsonrpc/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{http/pprof => net/smtp}/Makefile` (これも同様です。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/url/Makefile`

これらの `Makefile` ファイルでは、`include` ディレクティブで指定されている共通のビルド設定ファイル (`Make.inc`, `Make.pkg`) への相対パスが、パッケージの新しい階層構造に合わせて修正されています。

Goソースコードファイル自体（例: `src/pkg/http/client.go` が `src/pkg/net/http/client.go` にリネームされたものなど）は、内容の変更は伴わず、単にファイルパスが変更されただけです。これは `similarity index 100%` で示されています。

## コアとなるコードの解説

このコミットの「コアとなるコード」は、Go言語の標準ライブラリのビルドと構造を定義するメタデータとスクリプトです。

*   **`src/pkg/Makefile` の役割**:
    *   このファイルは、Goの標準ライブラリに含まれるすべてのパッケージを列挙し、それらをビルドするための全体的な指示を提供します。`DIRS` 変数にパッケージのパスを追加することで、`make` コマンドがそれらのパッケージをビルド対象として認識します。
    *   今回の変更では、古いトップレベルのパッケージパスが削除され、`net/` プレフィックスを持つ新しいパスが追加されました。これにより、ビルドシステムは新しいディレクトリ構造に従ってパッケージをビルドするようになります。
    *   `NOTEST` リストの更新は、特定のパッケージのテストをスキップするかどうかを制御します。`rand` が削除されたことは、そのテストが安定し、通常通り実行されるようになったことを示唆しています。

*   **`src/pkg/deps.bash` の役割**:
    *   このスクリプトは、Goのビルドプロセスにおいて、パッケージのインポートパスの解決と変換を行うための重要な役割を担っていました。
    *   Go 1リリース前は、パッケージのパスが頻繁に変更される可能性があったため、ソースコード内の `import` ステートメントをすぐに更新するのではなく、ビルド時に `deps.bash` を使って古いパスを新しいパスに「リダイレクト」するような仕組みが採用されていました。
    *   このコミットで `deps.bash` に追加された `sed` ルールは、まさにこの目的のために機能します。例えば、`http.install` という古いインポートパスが `net/http.install` に変換されることで、ソースコードがまだ `import "http"` と記述していても、ビルド時には `net/http` パッケージが参照されるようになります。これは、大規模なリファクタリングを段階的に、かつ安全に進めるための巧妙な戦略でした。

*   **個々の `Makefile` のパス修正の役割**:
    *   各パッケージディレクトリ内の `Makefile` は、そのパッケージ固有のビルド設定（ターゲット名、ソースファイルリストなど）を定義します。
    *   これらの `Makefile` が `Make.inc` や `Make.pkg` といった共通のビルドスクリプトを `include` する際に、正しい相対パスを指定することが不可欠です。パッケージが `src/pkg/http` から `src/pkg/net/http` へと1階層深くなったため、`../../Make.inc` は `../../../Make.inc` に変更する必要がありました。この修正は、ビルドシステムが共通のビルド設定を正しく読み込めるようにするために必要不可欠な変更です。

これらの変更は、Go言語の標準ライブラリがGo 1として安定し、将来にわたってメンテナンスしやすい構造を持つための基盤を築いたと言えます。特に、ネットワーク関連の機能が `net` パッケージの下に集約されたことは、Goのネットワークプログラミングにおける一貫性と直感性を高める上で重要な一歩でした。

the user is asking for a detailed technical explanation of a Go commit, based on the provided commit information and some metadata. I need to extract the relevant information from the commit data and then use web search to gather additional context, especially regarding "Go 1 package renaming CL #3". Finally, I need to present all this information in a structured Markdown format with specific headings.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Extract Commit Details**: Parse the `read_file` output to get the author, date, commit message, and file changes.
2.  **Analyze File Changes**: Understand the `rename from ... rename to ...` lines and the `Makefile` and `deps.bash` changes.
3.  **Integrate Web Search Results**: Use the information from the web search about Go package renaming and Go 1 context.
4.  **Structure the Output**: Populate each section of the Markdown output as requested by the user.

I have already performed step 1 and 2 (reading the file and doing a web search). Now I will proceed to structure the output.# [インデックス 10231] ファイルの概要

このコミットは、Go言語の標準ライブラリにおけるパッケージのリネーム（名称変更および移動）に関するものです。特に、`http`、`mail`、`rpc`、`smtp`、`url` といったトップレベルのパッケージが、`net` パッケージの下に統合される形で移動されました。これはGo 1リリースに向けた大規模なパッケージ構造の整理の一環であり、ネットワーク関連の機能が `net` パッケージの下に集約されることで、より論理的で分かりやすい構造を目指しています。

    This is Go 1 package renaming CL #3.
    This one merely moves the source; the import strings will be
    changed after the next weekly release.
    This one moves pieces into net.
    
    http -> net/http
    http/cgi -> net/http/cgi
    http/fcgi -> net/http/fcgi
    http/pprof -> net/http/pprof
    http/httptest -> net/http/httptest
    mail -> net/mail
    rpc -> net/rpc
    rpc/jsonrpc -> net/rpc/jsonrpc
    smtp -> net/smtp
    url -> net/url
    
    Also remove rand (now math/rand) from NOTEST - it has a test.
    
    The only edits are in Makefiles and deps.bash.

## 元コミット内容

このコミットは、Go言語の標準ライブラリにおけるパッケージのリネーム（名称変更および移動）に関するもので、特に「Go 1パッケージリネームCL #3」とされています。主な目的は、ソースコードの物理的な移動であり、インポートパスの変更は次回の週次リリース後に行われる予定であることが明記されています。

具体的には、以下のパッケージが `net` パッケージのサブディレクトリとして移動されました。

*   `http` が `net/http` へ
*   `http/cgi` が `net/http/cgi` へ
*   `http/fcgi` が `net/http/fcgi` へ
*   `http/pprof` が `net/http/pprof` へ
*   `http/httptest` が `net/http/httptest` へ
*   `mail` が `net/mail` へ
*   `rpc` が `net/rpc` へ
*   `rpc/jsonrpc` が `net/rpc/jsonrpc` へ
*   `smtp` が `net/smtp` へ
*   `url` が `net/url` へ

また、`rand` パッケージ（現在は `math/rand`）が `NOTEST` リストから削除されました。これは、`rand` パッケージにテストが存在するため、テスト対象から除外する必要がなくなったことを意味します。

この変更は、主に `Makefiles` と `deps.bash` というビルド関連のファイルに限定されており、実際のGoソースコードの内容自体は移動に伴うパスの修正以外には変更されていません。

## 変更の背景

このコミットは、Go言語の最初の安定版リリースであるGo 1に向けた準備の一環として行われました。Go 1では、言語仕様の安定化だけでなく、標準ライブラリの構造も整理され、将来にわたって互換性を維持できるような設計が目指されました。

変更の主な背景は以下の通りです。

1.  **パッケージ構造の整理と一貫性**: Go言語の標準ライブラリは、初期の段階では様々な機能がトップレベルのパッケージとして存在していました。しかし、Go 1に向けて、関連性の高い機能を特定の親パッケージの下にまとめることで、ライブラリ全体の構造をより論理的で発見しやすいものにする必要がありました。特に、ネットワーク関連の機能は多岐にわたるため、これらを `net` パッケージの下に集約することは自然な流れでした。
2.  **インポートパスの安定化**: Go 1の重要な目標の一つは、将来のバージョンアップにおいても既存のコードが動作し続けるように、インポートパスを安定させることでした。このコミットのような大規模なパッケージ移動は、Go 1リリース前に行うことで、リリース後の破壊的変更を最小限に抑えるための戦略的な判断でした。コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述は、この段階では物理的なファイル移動のみを行い、実際にコード内のインポートパスを修正するのは後回しにすることで、段階的に変更を適用し、影響を評価する意図があったことを示唆しています。
3.  **ビルドシステムの適応**: パッケージの物理的な移動に伴い、ビルドシステムが正しく新しいパスを認識し、コンパイルやテストを実行できるように、`Makefile` や `deps.bash` といったビルド関連のファイルを更新する必要がありました。

## 前提知識の解説

このコミットを理解するためには、以下のGo言語および関連するビルドシステムの基本的な知識が必要です。

*   **Go言語のパッケージシステム**:
    *   Go言語では、コードは「パッケージ」という単位で整理されます。パッケージは、関連する機能や型、関数などをまとめたもので、再利用可能なコードの最小単位となります。
    *   パッケージはファイルシステム上のディレクトリに対応しており、ディレクトリ名がパッケージ名となることが一般的です。
    *   他のパッケージの機能を利用するには、`import` ステートメントを使ってそのパッケージをインポートします。インポートパスは、通常、Goのワークスペースの `src` ディレクトリからの相対パスで指定されます（例: `import "net/http"`）。
*   **Go 1リリース**:
    *   Go 1は、2012年3月にリリースされたGo言語の最初の安定版です。このリリースでは、言語仕様、標準ライブラリ、ツールチェインが安定化され、後方互換性が保証されるようになりました。
    *   Go 1以前は、言語やライブラリの仕様が頻繁に変更される可能性がありましたが、Go 1以降は、既存のGo 1コードが将来のGoバージョンでも動作することが保証されています。このコミットは、Go 1の安定化プロセスの一環として行われたものです。
*   **`Makefile`**:
    *   `Makefile` は、Unix系のシステムでプログラムのビルドプロセスを自動化するためのファイルです。`make` コマンドによって解釈され、ソースコードのコンパイル、リンク、テストなどのタスクを実行するためのルールが記述されています。
    *   Go言語の初期のビルドシステムでは、`Makefile` が標準ライブラリのビルドにも広く利用されていました。このコミットでは、パッケージの移動に伴い、`Makefile` 内のディレクトリリスト (`DIRS`) やインクルードパスが更新されています。
*   **`deps.bash`**:
    *   `deps.bash` は、Go言語のビルドシステムの一部として使用されていたシェルスクリプトで、主に依存関係の解決やパスの変換を処理していました。
    *   このファイルは、Goのパッケージがビルドされる際に、古いインポートパスを新しいインポートパスにマッピングする役割を担っていました。コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述は、この `deps.bash` が一時的に古いパスを新しいパスに変換することで、ソースコード内のインポートパスの変更を遅らせることを可能にしていたことを示唆しています。
*   **`NOTEST` リスト**:
    *   `Makefile` 内に存在する可能性のあるリストで、ビルド時にテストを実行しないパッケージを指定するために使用されます。このコミットでは、`rand` パッケージが `NOTEST` から削除されており、これは `rand` パッケージにテストが追加されたか、テストの実行方法が変更されたことを意味します。

## 技術的詳細

このコミットの技術的な詳細は、主にファイルシステムの変更とビルドスクリプトの調整に集約されます。

1.  **パッケージの物理的な移動**:
    *   `src/pkg/http` ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ（`cgi`, `fcgi`, `pprof`, `httptest`）が `src/pkg/net/http` 以下に移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/mail` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/mail` へ移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/rpc` ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ（`jsonrpc`）が `src/pkg/net/rpc` 以下に移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/smtp` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/smtp` へ移動されました。
    *   `src/pkg/url` ディレクトリが `src/pkg/net/url` へ移動されました。
    *   これらの移動は、`git` の `rename` 操作として記録されており、ファイルの履歴が保持されています。多くのファイルで `similarity index 100%` と表示されているのは、ファイルの内容自体は変更されず、パスのみが変更されたことを示しています。

2.  **`src/pkg/Makefile` の変更**:
    *   `DIRS` 変数から、移動前のパッケージパス（例: `http`, `mail`, `rpc`, `smtp`, `url`）が削除されました。
    *   `DIRS` 変数に、移動後の新しいパッケージパス（例: `net/http`, `net/http/cgi`, `net/mail`, `net/rpc`, `net/smtp`, `net/url`）が追加されました。これにより、ビルドシステムが新しい場所にあるパッケージを認識し、ビルド対象に含めることができます。
    *   `NOTEST` 変数から `http/pprof` と `http/httptest` が削除され、代わりに `net/http/pprof` と `net/http/httptest` が追加されました。これは、これらのパッケージが新しいパスに移動した後も、引き続きテスト対象から除外されることを意味します（ただし、`rand` は `NOTEST` から完全に削除されました）。

3.  **`src/pkg/deps.bash` の変更**:
    *   このスクリプトは、Goのビルドプロセスにおいて、パッケージの依存関係を解決し、インポートパスを変換する役割を担っていました。
    *   変更点を見ると、古いパッケージ名（例: `http`, `mail`, `rpc`, `smtp`, `url`）に対応する正規表現パターンが追加され、それらが新しい `net` プレフィックス付きのパス（例: `net/http`, `net/mail`）にマッピングされるように `sed` コマンドのルールが追加されています。
    *   これは、コミットメッセージにある「the import strings will be changed after the next weekly release」という記述と一致します。つまり、この `deps.bash` の変更によって、ソースコード内のインポートパスがまだ古いままであっても、ビルド時には新しいパスに解決されるように一時的な対応がなされていたと考えられます。

4.  **個々の `Makefile` のパス修正**:
    *   移動された各パッケージ内の `Makefile` ファイルも更新されています。例えば、`src/pkg/http/Makefile` が `src/pkg/net/http/Makefile` にリネームされ、その内容も変更されています。
    *   変更内容は、`include ../../Make.inc` や `include ../../Make.pkg` といった共通のビルド設定ファイルへの相対パスが、パッケージの階層が深くなったことに合わせて `../../../Make.inc` や `../../../Make.pkg` のように修正されています。これは、`Makefile` が自身の位置から共通ファイルへの正しいパスを見つけられるようにするための調整です。

## コアとなるコードの変更箇所

このコミットにおける「コアとなるコードの変更箇所」は、Go言語のソースコードそのものというよりも、Goのビルドシステムとパッケージ構造を定義するファイル群です。

具体的には、以下のファイルが主要な変更箇所となります。

*   **`src/pkg/Makefile`**: Go標準ライブラリ全体のビルドを管理する主要なMakefile。パッケージのディレクトリリスト (`DIRS`) とテスト対象外リスト (`NOTEST`) が更新されました。
*   **`src/pkg/deps.bash`**: Goのビルドプロセスにおける依存関係解決とインポートパス変換を担うシェルスクリプト。古いパッケージパスから新しいパッケージパスへのマッピングルールが追加されました。
*   **各パッケージの `Makefile` ファイル**:
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{mail => net/http/cgi}/Makefile` (これは `mail/Makefile` が `net/http/cgi/Makefile` にリネームされたことを示唆しており、興味深い点です。実際には `mail/Makefile` は `net/mail/Makefile` にリネームされ、`http/cgi/Makefile` は `net/http/cgi/Makefile` にリネームされています。diffの表示が少し紛らわしいですが、実態はそれぞれのパッケージのMakefileが移動先に合わせてリネームされ、内容が修正されています。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/fcgi/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/http/httptest/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{smtp => net/http/pprof}/Makefile` (これも同様に、`smtp/Makefile` が `net/http/pprof/Makefile` にリネームされたように見えますが、実際にはそれぞれのMakefileが移動先にリネームされています。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/rpc/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/rpc/jsonrpc/Makefile`
    *   `src/pkg/{http/pprof => net/smtp}/Makefile` (これも同様です。)
    *   `src/pkg/{ => net}/url/Makefile`

これらの `Makefile` ファイルでは、`include` ディレクティブで指定されている共通のビルド設定ファイル (`Make.inc`, `Make.pkg`) への相対パスが、パッケージの新しい階層構造に合わせて修正されています。

Goソースコードファイル自体（例: `src/pkg/http/client.go` が `src/pkg/net/http/client.go` にリネームされたものなど）は、内容の変更は伴わず、単にファイルパスが変更されただけです。これは `similarity index 100%` で示されています。

## コアとなるコードの解説

このコミットの「コアとなるコード」は、Go言語の標準ライブラリのビルドと構造を定義するメタデータとスクリプトです。

*   **`src/pkg/Makefile` の役割**:
    *   このファイルは、Goの標準ライブラリに含まれるすべてのパッケージを列挙し、それらをビルドするための全体的な指示を提供します。`DIRS` 変数にパッケージのパスを追加することで、`make` コマンドがそれらのパッケージをビルド対象として認識します。
    *   今回の変更では、古いトップレベルのパッケージパスが削除され、`net/` プレフィックスを持つ新しいパスが追加されました。これにより、ビルドシステムは新しいディレクトリ構造に従ってパッケージをビルドするようになります。
    *   `NOTEST` リストの更新は、特定のパッケージのテストをスキップするかどうかを制御します。`rand` が削除されたことは、そのテストが安定し、通常通り実行されるようになったことを示唆しています。

*   **`src/pkg/deps.bash` の役割**:
    *   このスクリプトは、Goのビルドプロセスにおいて、パッケージのインポートパスの解決と変換を行うための重要な役割を担っていました。
    *   Go 1リリース前は、パッケージのパスが頻繁に変更される可能性があったため、ソースコード内の `import` ステートメントをすぐに更新するのではなく、ビルド時に `deps.bash` を使って古いパスを新しいパスに「リダイレクト」するような仕組みが採用されていました。
    *   このコミットで `deps.bash` に追加された `sed` ルールは、まさにこの目的のために機能します。例えば、`http.install` という古いインポートパスが `net/http.install` に変換されることで、ソースコードがまだ `import "http"` と記述していても、ビルド時には `net/http` パッケージが参照されるようになります。これは、大規模なリファクタリングを段階的に、かつ安全に進めるための巧妙な戦略でした。

*   **個々の `Makefile` のパス修正の役割**:
    *   各パッケージディレクトリ内の `Makefile` は、そのパッケージ固有のビルド設定（ターゲット名、ソースファイルリストなど）を定義します。
    *   これらの `Makefile` が `Make.inc` や `Make.pkg` といった共通のビルドスクリプトを `include` する際に、正しい相対パスを指定することが不可欠です。パッケージが `src/pkg/http` から `src/pkg/net/http` へと1階層深くなったため、`../../Make.inc` は `../../../Make.inc` に変更する必要がありました。この修正は、ビルドシステムが共通のビルド設定を正しく読み込めるようにするために必要不可欠な変更です。

これらの変更は、Go言語の標準ライブラリがGo 1として安定し、将来にわたってメンテナンスしやすい構造を持つための基盤を築いたと言えます。特に、ネットワーク関連の機能が `net` パッケージの下に集約されたことは、Goのネットワークプログラミングにおける一貫性と直感性を高める上で重要な一歩でした。
