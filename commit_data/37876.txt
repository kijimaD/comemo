    database/sql: fix logic for pulling a Conn from DB
    
    The logic for pulling a database connection from the DB pool should
    proceed as follows: attempt to pull either a cached connection or
    new connection N times in a loop. If each connection results
    in a bad connection, then create a new connection (no cache).
    
    Previously pulling a Conn from the pool, the last step also
    looked at the cache, rather then always creating a new connection.
    
    Fixes #29684
