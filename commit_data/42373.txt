    crypto/x509: save the temp dir in TestReadUniqueDirectoryEntries
    
    In CL 231958, TempDir was changed to create a new temp directory on
    each allocation, on the theory that it is easy to save in a variable
    for callers that want the same directory repeatedly. Apply that
    transformation here.
    
    Updates #38850
