    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: improve classification of loads and stores
    
    Currently, pool literals are added when they are not needed, namely
    in the case where the offset is a 24 bit unsigned scaled immediate.
    By improving the classification of loads and stores, we can avoid
    generating unused pool literals. However, more importantly this
    provides a basis for further improvement of the load and store
    code generation.
