    runtime/pprof: include labels for caller of goroutine profile
    
    The goroutine profile has close to three code paths for adding a
    goroutine record to the goroutine profile: one for the goroutine that
    requested the profile, one for every other goroutine, plus some special
    handling for the finalizer goroutine. The first of those captured the
    goroutine stack, but neglected to include that goroutine's labels.
    
    Update the tests to check for the inclusion of labels for all three
    types of goroutines, and include labels for the creator of the goroutine
    profile.
    
    For #63712
