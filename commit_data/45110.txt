    runtime: break out GC pacer into its own file
    
    This change breaks out the GC pacer into its own file so that it'll be
    easier to see the full implementation and change it. It also suggests an
    obvious place to put tests (mgcpacer_test.go).
    
    This includes all of gcControllerState, gcSetTriggerRatio, anything
    related to GOGC, and all related globals and constants.
    
    This is almost a clean move, except that globals and constants are
    formatted into blocks instead of having a separate "var" declaration for
    each one.
    
    For #44167.
