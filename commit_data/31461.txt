    cmd/compile: add minor bit twiddling optimizations
    
    Noticed while adding to the bitset implementation
    in cmd/compile/internal/gc.
    
    The (Com (Const)) optimizations were already present
    in the AMD64 lowered optimizations.
    They trigger 118, 44, 262, and 108 times
    respectively for int sizes 8, 16, 32, and 64
    in a run of make.bash.
    
    The (Or (And)) optimization is new.
    It triggers 3 times for int size 8
    and once for int size 64 during make.bash,
    in packages internal/poll, reflect,
    encoding/asn1, and go/types,
    so there is a bit of natural test coverage.
