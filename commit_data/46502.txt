    cmd/compile: fix transform.AssignOp to deal with tricky case
    
    When going to dictionary formats derived from the function
    instantiations, I had broken out noder.Assignop() to deal specially with
    shape types, but didn't quite get the tricky case right. We still need
    to allow conversion between shape types, but if the destination is an
    interface, we need to use CONVIFACE rather than CONVNOP.
    
    Fixes #48453.
