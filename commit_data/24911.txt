    runtime: avoid stat underflow crash
    
    If the area returned by sysReserve in mheap.sysAlloc is outside the
    usable arena, we sysFree it. We pass a fake stat pointer to sysFree
    because we haven't added the allocation to any stat at that point.
    However, we pass a 0 stat, so sysFree panics when it decrements the
    stat because the fake stat underflows.
    
    Fix this by setting the fake stat to the allocation size.
    
    Updates #13143 (this is a prerequisite to fixing that bug).
