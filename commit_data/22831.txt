    cmd/internal/obj: remove Biobuf unget
    
    This change applies CL 9365 to the copy of Biobuf in cmd/internal/obj.
    
    In the process I discovered that some of the methods that should have been
    checking the unget buffer before reading were not and it was probably just
    dumb luck that we handn't hit these issues before; Bungetc is only used in
    one place in cmd/internal/gc and only an unlikely code path.
