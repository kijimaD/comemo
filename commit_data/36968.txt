    cmd/compile: emit symbol for constant string before parallel compiler phase
    
    This CL makes sure we walk the newly generated assignment. Part of
    that walk makes sure that all symbols for strings are emitted before
    we start referencing them during the parallel compilation
    phase. Without this change, those references during the parallel phase
    do a create-if-not-exist, which leads to a data race.
    
    I'm not 100% sure this is the fix for the issues below, but optimistically
    assuming it is...
    
    Fixes #28170
    Fixes #28159
