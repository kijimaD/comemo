    net/http: remove TestTransportDialCancelRace
    
    This test was added to cover a specific race condition
    in request cancellation, applying only to the deprecated
    Transport.CancelRequest cancellation path. The test
    assumes that canceling a request at the moment
    persistConn.RoundTrip begins guarantees that it will
    be canceled before being sent.
    
    This does not apply to the newer forms of canceling
    a request: Request.Cancel and context-based cancellation
    both send the cancel signal on a channel, and do not
    check for cancellation before sending a request.
    
    A recent refactoring unified the implementation
    of cancellation, so the Transport.CancelRequest
    path now translates into context-based cancellation
    internally. This makes this test flaky, since
    sometimes the request completes before we read
    from the context's done channel.
    
    Drop the test entirely. It's verifying the fix
    for a bug in a code path which no longer exists,
    and the property that it's testing for (canceling
    a request at a very specific point in the internal
    request flow) is not interesting.
    
    Fixes #67533
