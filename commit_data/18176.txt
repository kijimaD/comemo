    crypto/rsa: support unpadded signatures.
    
    Usually when a message is signed it's first hashed because RSA has low
    limits on the size of messages that it can sign. However, some
    protocols sign short messages directly. This isn't a great idea because
    the messages that can be signed suddenly depend on the size of the RSA
    key, but several people on golang-nuts have requested support for
    this and it's very easy to do.
