    build: small cleanup in error message in make.bat
    
    Contrary to bash, double quotes cannot be used to group
    arguments in Windows shell, so they were being printed as
    literals by the echo command.
    
    Since a literal '>' is present in the string, it is sufficient
    to escape it correctly through '^'.
