    runtime: disable GC in TestPanicSystemstack's subprocess
    
    TestPanicSystemstack spins up a subprocess that has 2 goroutines
    deadlock on a runtime lock while on the system stack, with GOMAXPROCS=2.
    
    Each goroutine is going to be running on a P, and then is going to wedge
    itself up on that P.
    
    If a GC is active and a worker starts executing (using a P), then it
    could try to preempt a goroutine that is already blocked. It won't be
    able to, so it'll just sit there forever trying to suspend it. At this
    point there are no more Ps to execute the remaining goroutine that needs
    to print something so the parent process can continue the test.
    
    This change fixes this issue by disabling GCs in the child process. An
    alternative fix could be to increase GOMAXPROCS in the child, but maybe
    letting the GC be on (which assumes it'll always be able to *eventually*
    suspend a G) is just asking for trouble.
    
    Fixes #49388.
