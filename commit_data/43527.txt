    [dev.link] cmd/link: convert pcln linker phase to use loader APIs
    
    Rework the linker's pcln phase to work with the new loader. As part of
    this set of changes the handling of "go.file..." symbols has been
    revised somewhat -- previously they were treated as always live in the
    loader, and now we no longer do this.
    
    The original plan had been to have the new implementation generate
    nameless "inltree" symbols, however the plan now is to keep them
    named for now and convert them to nameless in a subsequent patch.
