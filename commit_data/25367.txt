    runtime: write sigsetstack for Darwin, fix sigaction arg
    
    It turns out that the second argument for sigaction on Darwin has a
    different type than the first argument.  The second argument is the user
    visible sigaction struct, and does not have the sa_tramp field.
    
    I base this on
      http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-1081.1.3/sys/sigaction.c
    not to mention actual testing.
    
    While I was at it I removed a useless memclr in setsig, a relic of the C
    code.
    
    This CL is Darwin-specific changes.  The tests for this CL are in
    https://golang.org/cl/17903 .
