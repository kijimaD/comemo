commit 40657c282d49d807d2bd76165fe013317855a653

    runtime: fix s390x build
    
    The new prototypes of duffzero and duffcopy must be
    accompanied by functions. Otherwise buildmode=shared
    (in particular, misc/cgo/testshared) has missing symbols.
    
    The right fix, of course, is to implement these on s390x.
    
    For #31916.
