    crypto/tls: generate random serial numbers.
    
    NSS (used in Firefox and Chrome) won't accept two certificates with the same
    issuer and serial. But this causes problems with self-signed certificates
    with a fixed serial number.
    
    This change randomises the serial numbers in the certificates generated by
    generate_cert.go.
