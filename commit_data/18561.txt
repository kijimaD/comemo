    misc/emacs: add support for ff-find-other-file
    
    c-mode classically uses ff-find-other-file to toggle between headers
    and implementation. For Go it seemingly makes sense to jump between
    implementation and test.
    
    While there's no enforced mapping of file names for tests, the mapping
    in this CL seems to be very common at least throughout the standard
    library, and ff-find-other-file fails gracefully when the mapping
    doesn't apply.
