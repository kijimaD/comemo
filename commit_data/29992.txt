    cmd/dist: really skip the testsanitizers tests on Android
    
    The test.bash script in misc/cgo/testsanitizers use GOOS, not GOHOSTOS.
    Fix the dist check from gohostos to goos accordingly.
    
    The error was masked on the builders because they run on a darwin host
    where the sanitizers tests never ran.
    
    With this change, the Android test suite completes successfully on
    Android/amd64.
