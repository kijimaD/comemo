    runtime: merge timerNoStatus into timerRemoved
    
    For historical reasons, we have to treat a zero timer as
    the same as an initialized timer that was stopped (removed).
    The two states are already treated mostly identically.
    Merge them.
    
    This is part of a larger simplification of the state set.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
