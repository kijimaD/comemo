    cmd/go: fix loading of buildid on OS X executables
    
    This is a bit of a belt-and-suspenders fix.
    On OS X, we now parse the Mach-O file to find the __text section,
    which is arguably the more proper fix. But it's a bit worrisome to
    depend on a name like __text not changing, so we also read more
    of the initial file (now 32 kB, up from 8 kB) and scan that too.
    
    Fixes #12327.
