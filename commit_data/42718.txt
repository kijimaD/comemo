    runtime: avoid double notewakeup in netpoll stub code
    
    Otherwise we can see
    - goroutine 1 calls netpollBreak, the atomic.Cas succeeds, then suspends
    - goroutine 2 calls noteclear, sets netpollBroken to 0
    - goroutine 3 calls netpollBreak, the atomic.Cas succeeds, calls notewakeup
    - goroutine 1 wakes up calls notewakeup, crashes due to double wakeup
    
    This doesn't happen on Plan 9 because it only runs one thread at a time.
    But Fuschia wants to use this code too.
