    runtime: skip TestCPUMetricsSleep as flaky
    
    This test is fundamentally flaky because of a mismatch between how
    internal idle time is calculated and how the test expects it to be
    calculated. It's unclear how to resolve this mismatch, given that it's
    perfectly valid for a goroutine to remain asleep while background
    goroutines (e.g. the scavenger) run. In practice, we might be able to
    set some generous lower-bound, but until we can confirm that on the
    affected platforms, skip the test as flaky unconditionally.
    
    For #60276.
    For #60376.
