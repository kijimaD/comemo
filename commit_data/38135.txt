    go/types: determine hasPtrRecv property from source rather than type
    
    LookupFieldOrMethod needs to know if a method receiver is a pointer
    type. Until now this was computed from the the method signature's
    receiver, which required the method signature to be type-checked.
    Furthermore, it required the receiver to be set before the method
    signature was fully type-checked in some cases (see issue #6638).
    
    This CL remembers this property during object resolution, when we
    know it from the source.
    
    With this CL, method signatures don't need to be type-checked before
    they can be looked up; this is a first step towards separating
    type checking of types and type-checking of associated methods.
    
    Updates #23203.
    Updates #26854.
