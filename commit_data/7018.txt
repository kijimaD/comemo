    regexp: fix performance bug, make anchored searches fail fast.
    
    The bug was that for an anchored pattern such as ^x, the prefix
    scan ignored the anchor, and could scan the whole file if there was
    no x present.  The fix is to do prefix matching after the anchor;
    the cost miniscule; the speedups huge.
