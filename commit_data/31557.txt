    cmd/go: fix TestCgoContainsSpace
    
    TestCgoContainsSpace builds a small program which mimics $CC.
    Usually, $CC attempts to compile a trivial code to detect its own
    supported flags (i.e. "-no-pie", which must be passed on some systems),
    however the mimic didn't consider these cases.
    
    This CL solve the issue.
    
    Also, use the same name as $CC, it may solve other potential problems.
    
    Fixes #20324
