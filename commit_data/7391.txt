    cgo: don't run cgo when not compiling
    
    The logic introduced to avoid running cgo when
    introducing _cgo_flags is faulty.  My goal was
    to handle it with the following statement:
    
        -include _cgo_flags
    
    The dash tells make to ignore errors if it can't
    include the file.
    
    What I missed, though, was the fact that it
    *will* attempt to build the file if it knows
    how.
    
    This change will introduce the originally
    intended semantics of not attempting to build
    the file before necessary.
