    cmd/link: pass flags to external linker in deterministic order
    
    Currently we may pass C linker flags in nondeterministic order,
    as on ELf systems we pass --export-dynamic-symbol for symbols from
    a map. This is usally not a big problem because even if the flags
    are passed in nondeterministic order the resulting binary is
    probably still deterministic. This CL makes it pass them in a
    deterministic order to be extra sure. This also helps build
    systems where e.g. there is a build cache for the C linking action.
