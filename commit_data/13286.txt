    runtime: use OS X vsyscall for gettimeofday (386)
    
    amd64 was done in CL 6275056.
    
    We don't attempt to handle machines with clock speeds
    less than 1 GHz. Those will fall back to the system call.
    
    benchmark       old ns/op    new ns/op    delta
    BenchmarkNow          364           38  -89.53%
