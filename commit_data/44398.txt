    [dev.link] cmd/internal: convert basic types to builtin symbols
    
    The Go compiler includes special treatment for a small set of very
    commonly used type symbols (26 to be exact); for these types it
    doesn't bother to emit type descriptors for "normal" compilations, and
    instead only generates them for the runtime package, so as to reduce
    object file bloat.
    
    This patch moves the set of type symbols in question from the
    PkgIdxNone index space (in the object file) to the PkgIdxBuiltin
    space, which saves some work in the compiler and loader (reduces each
    package's index space slightly).
