    runtime: rename m.gcing to m.preemptoff and make it a string
    
    m.gcing has become overloaded to mean "don't preempt this g" in
    general.  Once the garbage collector is preemptible, the one thing it
    *won't* mean is that we're in the garbage collector.
    
    So, rename gcing to "preemptoff" and make it a string giving a reason
    that preemption is disabled.  gcing was never set to anything but 0 or
    1, so we don't have to worry about there being a stack of reasons.
