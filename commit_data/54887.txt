    cmd/go/internal/script: check lack of error for non-waiting cmds
    
    In the script engine, if a command does not return a Wait function and
    it succeeds, we won't call checkStatus. That means that commands that
    don't have a wait function, have a "!" indicating that they are
    supposed to fail, and then succeed will spuriously not fail the script
    engine test even they were supposed to fail but didn't.
