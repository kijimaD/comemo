    internal/copyright: skip testdata and vendor directories only
    
    Using filepath.SkipDir without confirming that d is a directory makes
    it prone to taking unintended action if a file (not a directory) with
    the same name gets added.
    
    This isn't a problem today, but we shouldn't spend human code review
    time checking that this doesn't somehow happen in the future, either.
