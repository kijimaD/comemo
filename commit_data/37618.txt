    cmd/go/internal/modload: add missing build constraint in testgo.go
    
    That file is supposed to make unexpected dependencies on the main
    module easier to diagnose in 'go test cmd/go', but I accidentally left
    off the build constraint, so it was triggering outside of the test.
    
    Updates #29097
