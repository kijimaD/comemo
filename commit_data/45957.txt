    runtime: warn that KeepAlive is not an unsafe.Pointer workaround
    
    Even experienced users occasionally mistake that runtime.KeepAlive can
    be used as a workaround for following the unsafe.Pointer safety rules,
    but it cannot. Add an explicit warning to this effect to dissuade
    users from trying to use it as such.
    
    Fixes #47562.
