    cmd/gc: fix export data for aggressive inlining.
    
    Export data was broken after revision 6b602ab487d6
    when -l is specified at least 3 times: it makes the compiler
    write out func (*T).Method() declarations in export data, which
    is not supported.
    
    Also fix the formatting of recover() in export data. It was
    not treated like panic() and was rendered as "<node RECOVER>".
