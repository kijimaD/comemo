    A+C: first round of automated updates for Go 1.11 and missing AUTHORS
    
    One first round of low-hanging fruit, excluding anything unclear.
    
    Also fixed a bug where, if a contributor had different emails under
    different CLAs, only the first one was added to AUTHORS.
    
    Updates #12042
