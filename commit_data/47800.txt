    runtime: remove deferreturn dummy argument
    
    deferreturn has a dummy argument, that is only used for getting
    the caller's SP. When generating deferreturn calls, the compiler
    does not pass an actual argument or reserve its stack space.
    Also, the current code is written with the assumption about where
    the argument's address is on the stack. Currently this is correct
    for both ABI0 and the register ABI, but it may change in the
    future (e.g. if we remove dedicated spill slots). Remove the
    argument.
    
    Also remove the argument for getargp.
