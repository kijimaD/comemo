    reflect: test repeats with large scalar tails
    
    This adds a GC bitmap test of a type with many pointer bits and a
    large scalar tail, such as the one in issue #11286. This test would
    have failed prior to the fix in a8ae93f. This test is a more direct
    version of the test introduced in that commit (which was distilled
    from the failing test in the issue).
