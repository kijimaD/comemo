    net/http: fix too-strict validation of server header values
    
    As Andy Balholm noted in #11207:
    
    "RFC2616 ยง4.2 says that a header's field-content can consist of *TEXT,
    and RFC2616 ยง2.2 says that TEXT is <any OCTET except CTLs, but
    including LWS>, so that would mean that bytes greater than 128 are
    allowed."
    
    This is a partial rollback of the strictness from
    https://golang.org/cl/11207 (added in the Go 1.6 dev cycle, only
    released in Go 1.6beta1)
    
    Fixes #11207
