    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: cleanup fp conversions in ssa.go
    
    Change to table-driven instead of branchy code; leads to
    net reduction in lines, easier to understand what happens,
    easier to modify code if we want option to exclude generation
    of branchy cases.
    
    Doesn't appear to scale for 8x8 case of integer types.
