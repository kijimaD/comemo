    go/types: check if the interface is already complete in Complete
    
    Once Interfaces have been completed they must never be written again,
    as they may be used concurrently.
    
    Avoid writing Interface.complete unnecessarily in Complete. Also, update
    documentation to reflect that Complete must be called before the
    Interface may be considered safe for concurrent use.
    
    For #47726
