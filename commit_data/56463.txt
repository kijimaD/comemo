    cmd/link/internal/ld: clean tmpdir obj timestamps
    
    This patch changes the Go linker to "clean" (reset to Unix epoch) the
    timestamps on object files copied to the tmpdir that is presented to
    the external linker or archive tool. The intent is to improve build
    reproducibility on Darwin, where later versions of xcode seem to want
    to incorporate object file timestamps into the hash used for the final
    build ID (which precludes the possibility of having reproducible Go
    builds). Credit for this idea goes to Cherry (see
    https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64947#issuecomment-1887667189).
    
    Updates #64947.
