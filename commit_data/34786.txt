    database/sql/driver: rename ResetSessioner to SessionResetter
    
    Originally we tried the strict -er suffix as the rule in this case
    but eventually we decided it was too awkward: io.WriteByter
    became io.ByteWriter. By analogy, here the interface should be
    named SessionResetter instead of the awkward ResetSessioner.
    
    This change should not affect any drivers that have already
    implemented the interface, because the method name is not changing.
    
    (This was added during the Go 1.10 cycle and has not been
    released yet, so we can change it.)
