    runtime: fix use of wrong g in gentraceback
    
    gentraceback gets the currently running g to do some sanity checks, but
    should use gp everywhere to do its actual work. Some noncritical checks
    later accidentally used g instead of gp. This seems like it could be a
    problem in many different contexts, but I noticed in Windows profiling,
    where profilem calls gentraceback on a goroutine from a different
    thread.
