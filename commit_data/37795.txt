    cmd/compile: remove var sorting from DWARF inline generation
    
    When generation DWARF inline info records, the current implementation
    includes a sorting pass that reorders a subprogram's child variable
    DIEs based on class (param/auto) and name. This sorting is no longer
    needed, and can cause problems for a debugger (if we want to use the
    DWARF info for creating a call to an optimized function); this patch
    removes it.
    
    Ordering of DWARF subprogram variable/parameter DIEs is still
    deterministic with this change, since it is keyed off the order in
    which vars appear in the pre-inlining function "Dcl" list.
    
    Updates #27039
