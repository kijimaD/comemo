    [dev.power64] 9a: correct generation of four argument ops
    
    The "to" field was the penultimate argument to outgcode,
    instead of the last argument, which swapped the third and
    fourth operands.  The argument order was correct in a.y, so
    just swap the meaning of the arguments in outgcode.  This
    hadn't come up because we hadn't used these more obscure
    operations in any hand-written assembly until now.
