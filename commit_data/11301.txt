    summary:     gc: fix infinite recursion for embedded interfaces
    
    This is causing 'interface type loop' errors during compilation
    of a complex program.  I don't understand what's happening
    well enough to boil it down to a simple test case, but undoing
    this change fixes the problem.
    
    The change being undone is fixing a corner case (uses of
    pointer to interface in an interface definition) that basically
    only comes up in erroneous Go programs.  Let's not try to
    fix this again until after Go 1.
    
    Unfixes issue 1909.
