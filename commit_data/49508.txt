    reflect: add MapIter.SetKey and MapIter.SetValue
    
    These augment the existing MapIter.Key and MapIter.Value methods.
    The existing methods return new Values.
    Constructing these new Values often requires allocating.
    These methods allow the caller to bring their own storage.
    
    The naming is somewhat unfortunate, in that the spec
    uses the word "element" instead of "value",
    as do the reflect.Type methods.
    In a vacuum, MapIter.SetElem would be preferable.
    However, matching the existing methods is more important.
    
    Fixes #32424
    Fixes #46131
