    errors: reference Go 1.13 article about errors
    
    This commit amends package errors' documentation to include a reference
    to the https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors blog article. The motivation
    is multi-fold, but chiefly the article includes good information about
    error philosophy (e.g., when to wrap), and developers who have come to
    Go in the intervening five years are likely not have seen this article
    at all given the nature of blog publishing and post fanfare. The
    material deserves a promotion in visibility.
