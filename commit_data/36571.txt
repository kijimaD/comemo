    runtime: replace system goroutine whitelist with symbol test
    
    Currently isSystemGoroutine has a hard-coded list of known entry
    points into system goroutines. This list is annoying to maintain. For
    example, it's missing the ensureSigM goroutine.
    
    Replace it with a check that simply looks for any goroutine with
    runtime function as its entry point, with a few exceptions. This also
    matches the definition recently added to the trace viewer (CL 81315).
