    cmd/cgo: remove support for CGOPKGPATH
    
    CGOPKGPATH variable was undocumented, but it is not needed anymore.
    
    It was used before the existence of the go tool to tell cgo the full
    path of the package that it was building, which in turn set the name
    of the shared library that cgo expected to load back when cgo used
    shared libraries. CGOPKGPATH no longer does anything useful;
    it just affects the comments in the generated header file.
    
    Remove it to avoid any future confusion.
    
    Fixes #11852
