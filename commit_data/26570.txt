    net/http: make ListenAndServeTLS treat GetCertificate as a set cert too
    
    ListenAndServeTLS doesn't require cert and key file names if the
    server's TLSConfig has a cert configured. This code was never updated
    when the GetCertificate hook was added to *tls.Config, however.
    
    Fixes #14268
