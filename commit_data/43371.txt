    [dev.link] cmd/link: run setArchSyms earlier
    
    Add some new loader.Sym equivalents to the archSyms struct so that we
    can run setArchSyms earlier in the pipeline, and add a "mode" to
    setArchSyms to control whether it should create loader.Sym symbols or
    their *sym.Symbol equivalents.
    
    These change needed for a subsequent patch in which addexport() is run
    earlier as well
