    encoding/csv: preserve \r\n in quoted fields
    
    The parser mistakenly assumed it could always fold \r\n into \n, which
    is not true since a \r\n inside a quoted fields has no special meaning
    and should be kept as is.
    
    Fix this by not folding \r\n to \n inside quotes fields.
    
    Fixes #21201
