    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: reorg generated array hash loop
    
    The ORANGE structure that is being replaced by this CL was causing
    trouble with another CL (CL 275695).
    
    The problem occurs if you typecheck i in the middle of generating the
    body of the ORANGE loop. If you typecheck i, it ends up typechecking
    its definition, which secretly typechecks the containing ORANGE.  If
    you then add other items to the ORANGE body, those items will never
    get typechecked, as the ORANGE is already marked as typechecked.
    
    Instead, just steal the loop we use for the equality code. Might as
    well use the same pattern in both places.
