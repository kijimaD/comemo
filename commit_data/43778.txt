    [dev.link] cmd/link/internal/loader: add SetRelocType symbolbuilder method
    
    Clients may need to invoke the loader.Reloc2.SetType method to reset
    the type of a relocation from external flavor to internal flavor,
    meaning that the external type add-in needs to be zeroed (this is
    needed when adding dynsym entries).
    
    Add a new SymbolBuider method to support mutating the type of a reloc
    for an external symbol, so that the external type can be changed as
    well (Reloc2 doesn't have access to that). Also add similar methods
    for updating target symbol and addend, so as to have a consistent
    interface for ext reloc mutation.
