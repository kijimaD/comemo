    cmd/link: keep go.buildid alive on AIX external linking
    
    As we use relative addressing for text symbols in functab, it is
    important that the offsets we computed stay unchanged by the
    external linker, i.e. all symbols in Textp should not be removed
    by the external linker. Most of them are actually referenced (our
    deadcode pass ensures that), except go.buildid which is generated
    late and not used by the program. Keep it alive.
    
    Should fix AIX builder.
