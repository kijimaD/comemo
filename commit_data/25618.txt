    net: improve netsh usage in Windows unit tests
    
    The TestInterfaceAddrsWithNetsh Windows unit test parses and compares the
    output of the "netsh" command against more low level Windows API calls. In
    at least two cases, some quirks of netsh cause these comparisons to fail.
    
    One example appears to be wi-fi adapters. After a reboot, before it has
    been allowed to connect to a network, netsh for IPv4 will not show an
    address, whereas netsh for IPv6 will. If the interface is allowed to
    connect, and then disconnected, netsh for IPv4 now shows an address and
    the test will pass.
    
    The fix is to not compare netsh output if the interface is down.
    
    A related issue is that the IPv6 version of "netsh" can return an
    IPv4-embedded IPv6 address where the IPv4 component of the address
    is in decimal form, whilst the test is expecting hexadecimal form.
    
    For example, output might be:
    
      Address fe80::5efe:192.168.1.7%6 Parameters
        ...
    
    Whilst this is valid notation, the fix is to recognise this format in the
    "netsh" output and re-parse the address into the all-hexadecimal
    representation that the test is expecting.
    
    Fixes #13981
