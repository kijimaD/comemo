    runtime: don't start idle mark workers when barriers are cleared
    
    Currently, we don't start dedicated or fractional mark workers unless
    the mark 1 or mark 2 barriers have been cleared. One intended
    consequence of this is that no background workers run between the
    forEachP that disposes all gcWork caches and the beginning of mark 2.
    
    However, we (unintentionally) did not apply this restriction to idle
    mark workers. As a result, these can start in the interim between mark
    1 completion and mark 2 starting. This explains why it was necessary
    to reset the root marking jobs using carefully ordered atomic writes
    when setting up mark 2. It also means that, even though we definitely
    enqueue work before starting mark 2, it may be drained by the time we
    reset the mark 2 barrier. If this happens, currently the only thing
    preventing the runtime from deadlocking is that the scheduler itself
    also checks for mark completion and will signal mark 2 completion.
    Were it not for the odd behavior of idle workers, this check in the
    scheduler would not be necessary.
    
    Clean all of this up and prepare to remove this check in the scheduler
    by applying the same restriction to starting idle mark workers.
