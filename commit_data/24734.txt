    net/http/httputil: permit nil request body in ReverseProxy
    
    Accepting a request with a nil body was never explicitly supported but
    happened to work in the past.
    
    This doesn't happen in most cases because usually people pass
    a Server's incoming Request to the ReverseProxy's ServeHTTP method,
    and incoming server requests are guaranteed to have non-nil bodies.
    
    Still, it's a regression, so fix.
    
    Fixes #12344
