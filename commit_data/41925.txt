    time: document an alternative way of setting the system's time zone
    
    User's program was mutating time.Local variable and crashing
    itself as a consequence. Instead of documenting that time.Local
    variable should not be mutated, recommended way of setting the
    system's time zone has been documented.
    
    Fixes #34814
