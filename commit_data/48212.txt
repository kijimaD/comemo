    cmd/compile: fix abbrev selection for output params
    
    In Cl 302071 we changed the compiler to use a different recipe for
    selecting the DWARF frame offset for output parameters, to reflect the
    fact that registerized output params don't have a stack memory
    location on entry to the function. In the process, however, we
    switched from using an abbrev pf DW_ABRV_PARAM to an abbrev of
    DW_ABRV_AUTO, which means that Delve can't recognize them correctly.
    To fix the problem, switch back to picking the correct abbrev entry,
    while leaving the new offset recipe intact.
    
    Updates #40724.
    Updates #45720.
