    encoding/json: disallow unknown fields in Decoder
    
    Add a DisallowUnknownFields flag to Decoder.
    
    DisallowUnknownFields causes the Decoder to return an error when
    the the decoding destination is a struct and the input contains
    object keys which do not match any non-ignored, public field the
    destination, including keys whose value is set to null.
    
    Note: this fix has already been worked on in 27231, which seems
    to be abandoned. This version is a slightly simpler implementation
    and is up to date with the master branch.
    
    Fixes #15314
