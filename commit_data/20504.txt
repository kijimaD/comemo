commit 40dd6bf38e06bf26aa1c15438cdf0965cf778050

    runtime: mark asmcgocall<>(SB) as having no arguments
    
    It doesn't.
    Fixes 386 build.
    
    While we're here, mark runtime.asmcgocall as GO_ARGS,
    so that it will work with stack copying. I don't think anything
    that uses it can lead to a stack copy, but better safe than sorry.
    Certainly the runtime.asmcgocall_errno variant needs
    (and already has) GO_ARGS.
