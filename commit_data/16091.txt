    cmd/nm: don't add filename elements for m symbols
    
    The compilers used to generate only one 'm' symbol
    to record the stack frame size for each function.
    
    In cmd/nm, the 'm' and 'f' symbols are handled in
    the same switch case with a special exception for
    the symbol described above called ".frame".
    
    Now that the compilers emit additional 'm' symbols
    for precise garbage collection of the stack, the
    current logic is incorrect. cmd/nm will attempt to
    interpret these new 'm' symbols as 'f' symbols and
    add them to the file name index table.
    
    This fails with an out-of-memory condition when
    zenter encounters an 'm' symbol with a very large
    value (usually the .args symbol indicating a
    variadic NOSPLIT function).
