    cmd/go: don't substitute '$WORK' for work directory in -x heredocs
    
    When writing the set of commands excuted for go build -x, $WORK is
    substituted for the work directory in all the commnands. But this
    includes the cat <<EOF commands used to create a file with the given
    contents. While we can expect the shell to substitute $WORK properly,
    commands that read input files, such as importcfgs won't do that
    substitution.
    
    This is necessary to fix the build_dash_x script test for CL 432535
    because it removes .a files from the traditional stdlib install
    locations. The test can pass even with importcfg packagefiles in $WORK
    because all transitive imports are in the stdlib, and the compiler can
    fall back to finding stdlib .a files in their traditional places, but
    once they're gone the packagefile paths in $WORK will have paths that
    contain the string $WORK, and os.Open will fail to open them for
    reading. And since the fallback is gone the test will fail.
    
    For #47257
