    cmd/go: fix test.bash
    
    Fixes #7260.
    
    Fix three broken tests in test.bash
    
    The test for issue 4568 was confused by go $ACTION . producing a package root of "", avoiding this mode fixes the test but weakens the test.
    
    The test for issue 4773 was broken on linux because math/Rand would fail to resolve as a package causing the test for duplicates to be skipped.
    
    Finally, the last breakage was a small change in the error message.
    
    Also, add test for foldDup.
