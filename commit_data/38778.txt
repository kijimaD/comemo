    net/http: rename DialerAndTLSConfigSupportsHTTP2 to ForceAttemptHTTP2
    
    Transport.DialerAndTLSConfigSupportsHTTP2 was added just earlier
    in CL 130256 but we thought of a better name moments after submitting.
    ForceAttemptHTTP2 is shorter, more direct, and doesn't constrain what
    we can use it with in the future.
