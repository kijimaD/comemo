    runtime: new itab lookup table
    
    Keep itabs in a growable hash table.
    Use a simple open-addressable hash table, quadratic probing, power
    of two sized.
    Synchronization gets a bit more tricky. The common read path now
    has two atomic reads, one to get the table pointer and one to read
    the entry out of the table.
    
    I set the max load factor to 75%, kind of arbitrarily. There's a
    space-speed tradeoff here, and I'm not sure where we should land.
    
    Because we use open addressing the itab.link field is no longer needed.
    I'll remove it in a separate CL.
    
    Fixes #20505
