    cmd/compile: fix ICE due to missing inline function body
    
    For golang.org/cl/74110, I forgot that you can use range-based for
    loops to extract key values from a map value.
    
    This wasn't a problem for the binary format importer, because it was
    more tolerant about missing inline function bodies. However, the
    indexed importer is more particular about this.
    
    We could potentially just make it more lenient like the binary
    importer, but tweaking the logic here is easy enough and seems like
    the preferable solution.
    
    Fixes #26341.
