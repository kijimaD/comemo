    go/types: match Go 1.17 compiler error messages more closely
    
    Introduce a new constant compilerErrorMessages, which is set to false
    for now, so that we can port types2 error handling more precisely. Use
    this to (partially) port CL 363436, excluding issue49005.go, which does
    not exist in go/types (it was added in a previous CL related to compiler
    error messages, that was not ported). I've also included the bugfix from
    CL 364034, so that go/types is not broken at this commit.
    
    In subsequent CLs I'll catch up with error handling locations in types2
    that use compiler error messages.
