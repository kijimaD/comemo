    cmd/compile: align arm64 stack frames correctly
    
    If the compiler doesn't do it, cmd/internal/obj/arm64 will,
    and that will break the zeroing of ambiguously live values
    done in zerorange, which in turn produces uninitialized
    pointer cells that the GC trips over.
    
    For #9880.
