    test: chdir before running go tool, cleanup afterwards.
    
    issue9355 generated a file a.[568] in test/ directory and left it there.
    For tests like these, it is best to chdir to a test specific directory
    before generating any temporary files, since the tests are running
    in parallel and might otherwise race with each other for the same files.
