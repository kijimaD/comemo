commit 173fa1d8093409eb6a409f4e3196c7d334c10c48
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    cmd/go: delete references to old tools (5a etc.) from cmd/go docs
    
    Don't talk about commands that no longer exist.
    
    There are still references throughout the tree, mostly in comments,
    but they provide a charming historical backdrop for the idle tourist.
