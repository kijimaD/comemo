    codereview: drop Author: line on self-clpatch
    
    Right now if a Go developer makes a patch on one machine
    and then clpatches it onto another machine, changes
    subsequently made to the description are kept only
    locally, under the assumption that you are running
    clpatch because someone else wrote the CL, so you
    don't have permission to update the web.
    
    This change makes clpatch discard the "this was a
    clpatch" information from the metadata when you
    clpatch your own CLs from one machine to another.
    
    This should eliminate some confusion (for example
    in CL 4314054) but will no doubt introduce other
    confusion.
