    runtime: use correct types for maxstring and concatstring
    
    Updates #6046.
    This CL just does maxstring and concatstring. There are other functions
    to fix but doing them a few at a time will help isolate any (unlikely)
    breakages these changes bring up in architectures I can't test
    myself.
