    [dev.fuzz] testing: fix internal error exit condition for fuzz workers
    
    A fuzz worker process should exit with fuzzWorkerExitCode (70) if it
    encounters an internal error.
    
    This should generally only happen due to an I/O error on the worker
    side. I can't think of a way to write a realistic test case for
    this. test_fuzz_io_error.txt triggers an I/O error on the coordinator
    side, which is similar.
