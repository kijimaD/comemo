    [dev.typeparams] go/types: import unify.go and infer.go from dev.go2go
    
    After review, the only non-superficial change was to delegate the call
    to under(...) to structuralType. Otherwise, update a few stale comments:
     + correct indices in the documentation for tparamsList
     + update smap->substMap in a few places
     + update type parameter syntax in a couple places
    
    I've spent a good amount of time reviewing this code, and it
    fundamentally LGTM (though I wish we didn't have to copy the logic from
    identical0). However, as demonstrated in #43056, this code is
    complicated and not always easy to reason about, particularly in the
    context of type checking where not all types may be complete.
    
    To further understand and verify this code I'd like to write more tests,
    but that must wait until the rest of the changes in go/types are
    imported from dev.go2go.
