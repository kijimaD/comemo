    cmd/compile/internal/ir: export 'reassigned', handle OASOP
    
    Rename the ir-local function "reassigned" to "Reassigned" so that it
    can be used as part of inline heuristic analysis. Fix up the header
    comment along that way, which had some stale material. Add support for
    detecting reassignments via OASOP (as opposed to just simple
    assignments).
    
    Updates #61502.
