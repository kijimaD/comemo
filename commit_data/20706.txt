    fmt: fix internal unknownType function
    This thing should never be called, but before
    151960044 it was being called, incorrectly.
    This is now just a precaution but let's pretend it
    Fixes #8843
    even though that was fixed by 151960044.
    The test case was already there and ran, another mystery.
