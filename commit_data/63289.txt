    runtime: use small struct TestSynctest to ensure cleanups run
    
    Finalizers and cleanup funcs weren't running on the windows-arm64
    builder. Put finalizers/cleanups on a small struct containing a pointer
    rather than an *int, which fixes the problem.
    
    Also uncomment a synctest.Wait that was accidentally commented out.
    
    Fixes #73977
