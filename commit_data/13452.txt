    crypto/x509: exempt broken Entrust certificate from checks.
    
    Entrust have issued a root certificate that's not marked as valid for
    signing certificates.
    
    This results in Go programs failing to validate certificates that
    chain up to this root (i.e. gateway.push.apple.com:2195).
    
    Although this is clearly a mistake on Entrust's part, it seems that we
    will have to bodge around it.
