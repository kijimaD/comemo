    archive/zip: fix size value in ZIP64 end central directory record
    
    Section 4.3.14.1 of the ZIP file format
    spec (https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT) says,
    
        The value stored into the "size of zip64 end of central directory
        record" should be the size of the remaining record and should not
        include the leading 12 bytes.
    
    We were previously writing the full size, including the 12 bytes.
    
    Fixes #9857
