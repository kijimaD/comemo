    cmd/compile: remove post-inlining PGO graph dump
    
    The RedirectEdges logic is fragile and not quite complete (doesn't
    update in-edges), which adds overhead to maintaining this package.
    
    In my opinion, the post-inlining graph doesn't provide as much value as
    the pre-inlining graph. Even the latter I am not convinced should be in
    the compiler rather than an external tool, but it is comparatively
    easier to maintain.
    
    Drop it for now. Perhaps we'll want it back in the future for tracking
    follow-up optimizations, but for now keep things simple.
