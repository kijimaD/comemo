    fmt: give correct error for % at end of string when scanning
    
    Previously it said, "bad verb %% for ...", which is not only wrong,
    it's ironic as the fix is to use %% rather than % at the end of the
    string. Diagnose the case where a simple % is at EOF.
    
    If there's anything after the percent, the error is already good
    but this CL also puts quotes around the verb designation ('%d' etc.)
    to make it even clearer, especially when there is a space involved.
    
    Fixes #12315.
