    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: delay rewrite cycle detection for huge funcs
    
    The SSA rewrite pass has some logic that looks to see whether a
    suspiciously large number of rewrites is happening, and if so, turns
    on logic to try to detect rewrite cycles. The cycle detection logic is
    quite expensive (hashes the entire function), meaning that for very
    large functions we might get a successful compilation in a minute or
    two with no cycle detection, but take a couple of hours once cycle
    detection kicks in.
    
    This patch moves from a fixed limit of 1000 iterations to a limit set
    partially based on the size of the function (meaning that we'll wait
    longer before turning cycle detection for a large func).
    
    Fixes #66773.
