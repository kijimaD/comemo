    runtime: add Benchmark[Clear|Copy]Fat[8|12]
    
    These correspond to 2 and 3 word fat copies/clears on 8g, which dominate usage in the stdlib. (70% of copies and 46% of clears are for 2 or 3 words.) I missed these in CL 111350043, which added 2 and 3 word benchmarks for 6g. A follow-up CL will optimize these cases.
