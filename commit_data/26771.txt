    runtime: remove noescape hacks from gcWork
    
    When gcWork was first introduced, the compiler's escape analysis
    wasn't good enough to detect that that method receiver didn't escape,
    so we had to hack around this.
    
    Now that the compiler can figure out this for itself, remove these
    hacks.
