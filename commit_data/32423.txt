    encoding/asn1: add NullBytes and NullRawValue for working with ASN.1 NULL
    
    There were a number of places in crypto/x509 that used hardcoded
    representations of the ASN.1 NULL type, in both byte slice and
    RawValue struct forms. This change adds two new exported vars to
    the asn1 package for working with ASN.1 NULL in both its forms, and
    converts all usages from the x509 package.
    
    In addition, tests were added to exercise Marshal and Unmarshal on
    both vars.
    
    See #19446 for discussion.
