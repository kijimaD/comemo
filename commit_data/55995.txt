    cmd/compile: emit ODCL node for autotmp during RewriteNonNameCall
    
    For f()() call, the compiler rewrite it roughly to:
    
            autotmp := f()
            autotmp()
    
    However, if f() were inlined, escape analysis will confuse about the
    lifetime of autotmp, leading to bad escaping decision.
    
    This CL fixes this issue by rewriting f()() to:
    
            var autotmp
            autotmp = f()
            autotmp()
    
    This problem also happens with Unified IR, until CL 421821 land.
    
    Fixes #57434
