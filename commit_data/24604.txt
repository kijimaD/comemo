    path/filepath: test EvalSymlinks returns canonical path on windows
    
    When you create C:\A.TXT file on windows, you can open it as c:\a.txt.
    EvalSymlinks("c:\a.txt") returns C:\A.TXT. This is all EvalSymlinks
    did in the past, but recently symlinks functionality been implemented on
    some Windows version (where symlinks are supported). So now EvalSymlinks
    handles both: searching for file canonical name and resolving symlinks.
    
    Unfortunately TestEvalSymlinks has not been adjusted properly. The test
    tests either canonical paths or symlinks, but not both. This CL separates
    canonical paths tests into new TestEvalSymlinksCanonicalNames, so all
    functionality is covered. Tests are simplified somewhat too.
    
    Also remove EvalSymlinksAbsWindowsTests - it seems not used anywhere.
