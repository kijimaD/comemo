    strings: align Clone output with string([]byte(""))
    
    Add a comment how strings of length 0 are treated and
    that they always will result in the return of a string
    equal to the constant string "".
    
    The previous implementation would return a string header that uses
    runtime.zerobase as the backing array pointer while the string constant
    "" has 0 as pointer value.
    
    Using 0 has the backing array pointer is also the behaviour of
    string([]byte(input)) which makes the new behaviour a better drop in
    replacement.
