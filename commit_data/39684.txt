    cmd/compile: move statement marks from jumps to targets
    
    When a jump at the end of a block is about to be marked as
    a statement, if the first real instruction in the target
    block is also a statement for the same line, remove the
    mark from the jump.
    
    This is a first effort at a minimal-harm heuristic.
    A better heuristic might skip over any "not-statement"
    values preceding a definitely marked value.
    
    Fixes #29443.
