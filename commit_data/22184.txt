    cmd/go: add $DOLLAR to the predefined variables for go generate
    
    Without some hook like this, it's impossible to get a $ into the generate
    command, which is necessary if you're trying to do some shell scripting
    or regular expressions.
    
    We could use backslash escaping but that's already tricky enough
    because the strings are processed as Go strings. Using $ like this
    means we need no more mechanism, just a predefined variable.
    
    We may need to revisit this but I hope we can avoid new quoting rules.
