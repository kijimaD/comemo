    doc: update Concurrency, Functions and Methods, and Control Flow sections
    
    Many parts of the FAQ are dusty and need cleaning up.
    This is the first of a series of changes to bring it up to date.
    Since it was first written at the time of release, some of the
    ideas and background have changed, and some historical
    remarks are largely irrelevant now.
    
    Update #26107.
