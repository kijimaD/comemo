commit a3677b5f223db6ccadf26f81a751c4f8c8c0eaf9

    math: handle exponent separately in Log2
    
    This guarantees that powers of two return exact answers.
    
    We could do a multiprecision approximation for the
    rest of the answer too, but this seems like it should be
    good enough.
    
    Fixes #4567.
