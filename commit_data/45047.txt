    cmd/go/internal/modload: change mvsReqs to store roots instead of a full build list
    
    The mvsReqs implementation has always been a bit ambivalent about
    whether the root requirements return the full build list, just the
    direct requirements, or some hybrid of the two.
    
    However, a full build list always requires the Target module as the
    first entry, and it's easer to remove a redundant leading element from
    a slice than to add one. Changing the mvsReqs field to contain
    arbitrary roots instead of a full build list eliminates the need to
    add redundant elements, at the cost of needing to remove redundant
    elements in more places.
    
    For #36460
