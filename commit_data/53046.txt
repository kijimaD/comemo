    cmd/dist: refactor adding to the test list into a method
    
    Currently, there are four places that add distTests to the
    tester.tests list. That means we're already missing a few name
    uniqueness checks, and we're about to start enforcing some more
    requirements on tests that would be nice to have in one place. Hence,
    to prepare for this, this CL refactors the process of adding to the
    tester.tests list into a method. That also means we can trivially use
    a map to check name uniqueness rather than an n^2 slice search.
    
    For #37486.
