    encoding/xml: move unexported const out of exported const block
    
    CL 58210 introduced this constant for reasons I don't understand.
    It should not be in the exported const block, which will pollute
    godoc output with a "... unexported" notice.
    
    Also since we already have a constant named xmlnsPrefix for "xmlns",
    it is very confusing to also have xmlNamespacePrefix for "xml".
    If we must have the constant at all, rename it to xmlPrefix.
