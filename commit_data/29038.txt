    cmd/compile: use a map to detect duplicate type switch cases
    
    This is a bit simpler than playing sorting games,
    and it is clearer that it generates errors
    in the correct (source) order.
    
    It also allows us to simplify sorting.
    
    It also prevents quadratic error messages for
    (pathological) inputs with many duplicate type cases.
    
    While weâ€™re here, refactoring deduping into separate functions.
    
    Negligible compilebench impact.
    
    Fixes #15912.
