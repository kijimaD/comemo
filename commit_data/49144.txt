    Revert "testing: document -race goroutine limits"
    
    This reverts commit 4907c62f99fbfc8608a79a17c20d89f50956d9fc.
    
    Reason for revert: Race detector v3, which we just upgraded to, no longer has a goroutine limit.
    
    (small caveat: openbsd/amd64 can't be updated, windows/amd64 isn't updated yet but should be by release time.)
