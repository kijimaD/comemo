    cmd/compile/internal/types2: permit parentheses around types in interfaces
    
    Before Go 1.18, an embedded type name in an interface could not be
    parenthesized. With generalized embedding of types in interfaces,
    where one might write ~(chan<- int) for clarity (making clear that
    the ~ applies to the entire channel type), it also makes sense to
    permit (chan<- int), or (int) for that matter.
    
    Adjust the parser accordingly to match the spec.
    
    (go/types already accepts the notation as specified by the spec.)
    
    Fixes #52391.
