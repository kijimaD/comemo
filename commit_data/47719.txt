    net: in (*netFD).dial, use the passed in local address if getsockname fails
    
    'man getsockname' lists a number of possible failure modes, including
    ENOBUFS (for resource exhaustion) and EBADF (which we could possibly
    see in the event of a bug or race condition elsewhere in the program).
    
    If getsockname fails for an explicit user-provided local address, the
    user is probably not expecting LocalAddr on the returned net.Conn to
    return nil. This may or may not fix #34611, but should at least help
    us diagnose it more clearly.
    
    While we're add it, also add more nil-checking logic in the test based
    on the stack traces posted to
    https://golang.org/issue/34611#issuecomment-975923748.
    
    For #34611
