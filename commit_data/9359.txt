    exp/template: support field syntax on maps
    
    While using exp/template in practice, the syntax for
    indexing values using the "index" action was found to be
    very inconvenient for frequent use when handling dynamic
    data from maps such as the ones used with json and yaml,
    that use a type like map[string]interface{}.
    
    For these kinds of maps, the default handling of fields as
    {{.Field}} makes the task of handling the several references
    significantly more pleasant and elegant, and is equivalent
    to what's currently done in the "template" package and in
    other external packages (e.g. mustache).
    
    Even with this change, the index action is still relevant
    as it allows indexing maps in other scenarios where keys
    wouldn't be valid field names.
