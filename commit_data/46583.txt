    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: add code to support register ABI spills around morestack calls
    
    This is a selected copy from the register ABI experiment CL, focused
    on the files and data structures that handle spilling around morestack.
    Unnecessary code from the experiment was removed, other code was adapted.
    
    Would it make sense to leave comments in the experiment as pieces are
    brought over?
    
    Experiment CL (for comparison purposes)
