    text/template: add support for reflect.Value args, results in funcs
    
    Add support for passing reflect.Values to and returning reflect.Values from
    any registered functions in the FuncMap, much as if they were
    interface{} values. Keeping the reflect.Value instead of round-tripping
    to interface{} preserves addressability of the value, which is important
    for method lookup.
    
    Change index and a few other built-in functions to use reflect.Values,
    making a loop using explicit indexing now match the semantics that
    range has always had.
    
    Fixes #14916.
