    go/types, types2: remove superflous type parameter length checks
    
    There is no need to check for length equality of type parameter
    lists in Checker.missingMethod: the Identical predicate does
    this check. Furthermore, we don't have methods with their own
    type parameters. Remove the unnecessary (duplicate) code.
    
    Also, update doc string on missingMethod and rename the 2nd
    result parameter for clarity, and clarify internal comments.
    
    For go/types, include the same case-folding code as for types2
    but leave it disabled or now. Adjust any other differences in
    the missingMethod implementation.
    
    With this change, the types2 and go/types code of missingMethod
    is identical again except for the disabled case-folding lookup.
    
    No functionality changes.
    
    Preparation for fixing some of the outstanding error reporting issues.
