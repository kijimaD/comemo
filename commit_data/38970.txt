    all: refer to map elements as elements instead of values
    
    The spec carefully and consistently uses "key" and "element"
    as map terminology. The implementation, not so much.
    
    This change attempts to make the implementation consistently
    hew to the spec's terminology. Beyond consistency, this has
    the advantage of avoid some confusion and naming collisions,
    since v and value are very generic and commonly used terms.
    
    I believe that I found all everything, but there are a lot of
    non-obvious places for these to hide, and grepping for them is hard.
    Hopefully this change changes enough of them that we will start using
    elem going forward. Any remaining hidden cases can be removed ad hoc
    as they are discovered.
    
    The only externally-facing part of this change is in package reflect,
    where there is a minor doc change and a function parameter name change.
    
    Updates #27167
