    cmd/go: fix experiment isolation in cache key
    
    In general we don't assume that the go command knows the
    specific version of the compiler being used, including which
    experiments the compiler was built with. Let the compiler tell us,
    instead of importing cmd/internal/objabi from cmd/go.
    
    Replacement for CL 128735.
