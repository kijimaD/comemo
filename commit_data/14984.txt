    misc/dashboard/builder: synchronize accesses to goroot, always -commit
    
    This prevents the occasional issue when Mercurial screws up the locking
    itself, and by moving the locking into this process we can use the
    goroot for other things (such as automatically updating the builder
    binary).
    
    It also asks all builders to poll for new commits.
