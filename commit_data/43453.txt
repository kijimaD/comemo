    [dev.link] cmd/link/internal/loader: support 'variant' relocations
    
    Add support to the loader for getting/setting the 'variant' property
    of a symbol relocation. The variant property handles unusual or
    infrequently used relocations that have both a type and a variant of
    that type (this is needed for S390).
    
    In the sym.Symbol world, a relocation variant is a field on the
    'relocExt' extension that is part of sym.Reloc. In this new
    implementation for the loader, reloc variants are stored in a side
    table (a map) in the loader, and accessed via loader methods.
