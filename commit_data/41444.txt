    cmd/compile: run deadcode before nilcheck for better statement relocation
    
    Nilcheck would move statements from NilCheck values to others that
    turned out were already dead, which leads to lost statements.  Better
    to eliminate the dead code first.
    
    One "error" is removed from test/prove.go because the code is
    actually dead, and the additional deadcode pass removes it before
    prove can run.
