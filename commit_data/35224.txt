    runtime: don't issue cgocheck error for timer bucket source pointer
    
    The cgo checker was issuing an error with cgocheck=2 when a timer
    bucket was stored in a pollDesc. The pollDesc values are allocated
    using persistentalloc, so they are not in the Go heap. The code is OK
    since timer bucket pointers point into a global array, and as such are
    never garbage collected or moved.
    
    Mark timersBucket notinheap to avoid the problem. timersBucket values
    only occur in the global timers array.
    
    Fixes #23435
