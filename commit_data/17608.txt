    doc/go1.2.html: compiler changes
    Document the semantic changes within the gc toolchain.
    
    Also delete the mention of unbalanced right delims in template
    That change was rolled back.
    
    Absent typos, things we've forgotten, and new things that happen,
    the release notes are ready.
