    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: fix MOVFL REG, CONST
    
    The MOVFL instruction (which external PPC64 docs call mtcrf) can take
    either a CR register or a constant. It doesn't make sense to specify
    both, as the CR register implies the constant value. Specifying either
    a register or a constant is enforced by the implementation in the
    asmout method (case 69).
    
    However, the optab was providing a form that specified both a constant
    and a CR register, and was not providing a form that specified only a
    constant. This CL fixes the optab table to provide a form that takes
    only a constant.
    
    No test because I don't know where to write it. The next CL in this
    series will use the new instruction format.
