    A+C: automated updates
    
    The previous automated updates only added missing entries for commits
    since Go 1.4, with the assumption that we were caught up on things
    prior to that. (Initially motivated by the existence of junk email
    address jokes in the early git history, which I initially didn't want
    to whitelist)
    
    But it turns out we were missing lots of stuff, at least for subrepos
    prior to N months ago.
    
    This is an update with all subrepos updated, with no date
    restrictions.
