    runtime: re-add call to ts.cleanHead (n√©e cleantimers) during timer add
    
    Before CL 564118, there were two ways to add a new timer:
    addtimer or modtimer. Much code was duplicated between them
    and it was always valid to call modtimer instead of addtimer
    (but not vice versa), so that CL changed all addtimer call sites
    to use modtimer and deleted addtimer.
    
    One thing that was unique to addtimer, however, was that it
    called cleantimers (now named ts.cleanHead) after locking the
    timers, while modtimer did not. This was the only difference
    in the duplicated code, and I missed it. Restore the call to
    ts.cleanHead when adding a new timer.
    
    Also fix double-unlock in cleanHead.
