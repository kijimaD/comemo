    cmd/go: add a control case to the mod_vendor_trimpath test
    
    In reviewing CL 215940, it took me a while to find the control
    condition for the test, which was located in build_cache_trimpath.txt.
    
    We could consolidate the two tests, but since they check for
    regressions of separate issues (with separate root-causes), I think it
    makes sense to keep them separate.
    
    However, I would like the control condition to be present in the same
    source file, so that we'll be more likely to update both cases if the
    behavior of one of them is changed.
    
    Updates #36566
