    net/http: set/override Content-Length for encoded range requests
    
    Currently, http.ServeContent returns invalid Content-Length header if:
    
    * Request is a range request.
    * Content is encoded (e.g., gzip compressed).
    * Content-Length of the encoded content has been set before calling
      http.ServeContent, as suggested in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19420.
    
    Example:
    
            w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
            w.Header().Set("Content-Length", strconv.Itoa(len(compressedJsonBody)))
            w.Header().Set("Content-Encoding", "gzip")
            w.Header().Set("Etag", etag)
            http.ServeContent(
                    w, req, "", time.Time{},
                    bytes.NewReader(compressedJsonBody),
            )
    
    The issue is that http.ServeContent currently sees Content-Length as
    something optional when Content-Encoding is set, but that is a problem
    with range request which can send a payload of different size. So this
    reverts https://go.dev/cl/4538111 and makes Content-Length be set
    always to the number of bytes which will actually be send (both for
    range and non-range requests).
    
    Without this fix, this is an example response:
    
            HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
            Accept-Ranges: bytes
            Content-Encoding: gzip
            Content-Length: 351
            Content-Range: bytes 100-350/351
            Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
            Etag: "amCTP_vgT5PQt5OsAEI7NFJ6Hx1UfEpR5nIaYEInfOA"
            Date: Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:42:15 GMT
    
    As you see, Content-Length is invalid and should be 251.
