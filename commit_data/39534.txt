    encoding/hex: simplify encoder arithmetic
    
    Two additions are faster than two multiplications and one addition. The
    code seems simpler to me too, as it's more obvious that we advance two
    destination bytes for each source byte.
    
    name            old time/op  new time/op  delta
    Encode/256-8     374ns ± 0%   331ns ± 0%  -11.44%  (p=0.008 n=5+5)
    Encode/1024-8   1.47µs ± 0%  1.29µs ± 0%  -11.89%  (p=0.004 n=6+5)
    Encode/4096-8   5.85µs ± 1%  5.15µs ± 0%  -11.89%  (p=0.004 n=6+5)
