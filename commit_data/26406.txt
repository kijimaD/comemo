    cmd/compile: don't penalize ODOT and friends when inlining
    
    Historically ODOT and friends have been considered to cost an extra
    budget point when deciding whether they should be inlined, because they
    had an ONAME node that represented the name to the right of the dot.
    This doesn't really make sense, as in general that symbol does not add
    any extra instructions; it just affects the offset of the load or store
    instruction.  And the ONAME node is gone now.  So, remove the extra
    cost.
    
    This does not pass toolstash -cmp, as it changes inlining decisions.
    For example, mspan.init in runtime/mheap.go is now considered to be an
    inlining candidate.
