commit 3208917d54fea665392b692dee1bf1a921510fc2

    gc: look at cumulative error count, not just per-function.
    
    Not sure if this is what you'd really want.  Maybe with a higher limit than 10
    or perhaps keep checking nerrors > 10 per yyerror, but check the cumulative
    after each function?
