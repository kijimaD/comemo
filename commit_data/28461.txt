    build: enable framepointer mode by default
    
    This has a minor performance cost, but far less than is being gained by SSA.
    As an experiment, enable it during the Go 1.7 beta.
    Having frame pointers on by default makes Linux's perf, Intel VTune,
    and other profilers much more useful, because it lets them gather a
    stack trace efficiently on profiling events.
    (It doesn't help us that much, since when we walk the stack we usually
    need to look up PC-specific information as well.)
    
    Fixes #15840.
