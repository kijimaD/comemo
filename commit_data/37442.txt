    cmd/cgo: add column number to line directives
    
    Due to a new specification of //line: directives, missing
    column info is now treated as column 0, aka "unknown column"
    (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24183 for details).
    
    As cgo does not add column number to generated //line: directive,
    resulting files parsed do not have column info.
    
    Fix by adding column of 1 to generated line directives.
    
    Fixes #26692
