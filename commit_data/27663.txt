    cmd/cgo: fix use of unsafe argument in new deferred function
    
    The combination of https://golang.org/cl/23650 and
    https://golang.org/cl/23675 did not work--they were tested separately
    but not together.
    
    The problem was that 23650 introduced deferred argument checking, and
    the deferred function loses the type that 23675 started requiring. The
    fix is to go back to using an empty interface type in a deferred
    argument check.
    
    No new test required--fixes broken build.
