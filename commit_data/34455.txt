    test: move load/store combines into asmcheck
    
    This CL moves the load/store combining tests into asmcheck.
    In addition at being more compact, it's also now easier to
    spot what it is missing in each architecture.
    
    While doing so, I think I uncovered a bug in ppc64le and arm64
    rules, because they fail to load/store combine in non-trivial
    functions. Not sure why, I'll open an issue.
