    time: be consistent about representation of UTC location in Time struct
    
    In the zero Time, the (not user visible) nil *Location indicates UTC.
    In the result of t.UTC() and other ways to create times in specific
    zones, UTC is indicated by a non-nil *Location, specifically &utcLoc.
    This creates a representation ambiguity exposed by comparison with ==
    or reflect.DeepEqual or the like.
    
    Change time.Time representation to use only nil, never &utcLoc,
    to represent UTC. This eliminates the ambiguity.
    
    Fixes #15716.
