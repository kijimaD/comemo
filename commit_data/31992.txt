    net, net/http: adjust time-in-past constant even earlier
    
    The aLongTimeAgo time value in net and net/http is used to cancel
    in-flight read and writes. It was set to time.Unix(233431200, 0)
    which seemed like far enough in the past.
    
    But Raspberry Pis, lacking a real time clock, had to spoil the fun and
    boot in 1970 at the Unix epoch time, breaking assumptions in net and
    net/http.
    
    So change aLongTimeAgo to time.Unix(1, 0), which seems like the
    earliest safe value. I don't trust subsecond values on all operating
    systems, and I don't trust the Unix zero time. The Raspberry Pis do
    advance their clock at least. And the reported problem was that Hijack
    on a ResponseWriter hung forever, waiting for the connection read
    operation to finish. So now, even if kernel + userspace boots in under
    a second (unlikely), the Hijack will just have to wait for up to a
    second.
    
    Fixes #19747
