    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: refactor CorpusEntry type
    
    CorpusEntry is now a struct type with Name and Data fields. In the
    future, it may have more fields describing multiple values with
    different types added with f.Add.
    
    CorpusEntry must be the same type in testing and
    internal/fuzz. However, we don't want to export it from testing, and
    testing can't import internal/fuzz. We define it to be a type alias of
    a struct type instead of a defined type. We need to define it to the
    same thing in both places. We'll get a type error when building cmd/go
    if there's a difference.
