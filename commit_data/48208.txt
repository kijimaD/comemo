    runtime: work around vet asmdecl checks for openbsd/386 mstart_stub
    
    Include a NOP with the SP in order to disable/bypass vet asmdecl checks
    for runtime.mstart_stub on openbsd/386. Without this we get:
    
    runtime/sys_openbsd_386.s:33:1: [386] mstart_stub: use of 32(SP) points beyond argument frame
