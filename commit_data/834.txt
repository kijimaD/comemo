    - make optional semicolons explicit in grammar in all places
    except in statement list, where it is expressed in words
    - allow for empty import, const, type, and var decl lists inside ()'s
    - fixed grammar for inc/dec statements
    - added empty statement as it appears to be accepted by 6g
