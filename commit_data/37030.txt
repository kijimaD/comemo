    debug/elf,macho,pe: support compressed DWARF
    
    Since we're going to start compressing DWARF on Windows and maybe
    Darwin, copy the ELF support for .zdebug sections to macho and pe. The
    code is almost completely the same across the three.
    
    While I was here I added support for compressed .debug_type sections,
    which I presume were overlooked before.
    
    Tests will come in a later CL once we can actually generate compressed
    PE/Mach-O binaries, since there's no other good way to get test data.
    
    Updates #25927, #11799
