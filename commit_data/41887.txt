    [dev.link] cmd/link: add new slice interface for querying aux symbols
    
    Add a new loader.Loader.ReadAuxSyms method that returns a slice
    containing the ids of the aux symbols for a specified global symbol.
    This is similar to the new interface recently added that allows you to
    get back a slice of relocations (as opposed to making calls into the
    loader for each one). This was idea suggested by Cherry. Compilebench
    numbers:
    
    name                      old time/op       new time/op       delta
    LinkCompiler                    1.63s ± 9%        1.57s ± 7%  -3.84%  (p=0.006 n=20+20)
    LinkWithoutDebugCompiler        1.15s ±11%        1.11s ±11%    ~     (p=0.108 n=20+20)
    
    name                      old user-time/op  new user-time/op  delta
    LinkCompiler                    1.99s ± 8%        2.00s ±12%    ~     (p=0.751 n=19+19)
    LinkWithoutDebugCompiler        1.14s ±11%        1.19s ±21%    ~     (p=0.183 n=20+20)
