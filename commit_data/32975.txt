    syscall: mark forkAndExecInChild1 noinline
    
    This certainly won't get inlined right now, but in the spirit of
    making this more robust, we have to disable inlining because inlining
    would defeat the purpose of separating forkAndExecInChild1 into a
    separate function.
    
    Updates #20732.
