    test: add escape regress tests for runtime and sync atomics
    
    There weren't any tests to make sure these work correctly, and this
    led to escape analysis regressions in both linux/s390x and js/wasm.
    
    The underlying issue that cmd/compile is only getting some of these
    correct because escape analysis doesn't understand //go:linkname is
    still present, but at least this addresses the fragility aspect.
    
    Updates #15283.
