    cmd/link: mark windows/arm as all PIE
    
    If the linker thinks that it's in exe mode instead of pie mode, it
    won't emit relocations when generating the pcln table, and we wind
    up with crashes like this on windows/arm, where all binaries are
    in fact relocated:
    
        Building Go toolchain2 using go_bootstrap and Go toolchain1.
        fatal error: minpc or maxpc invalid
        runtime: panic before malloc heap initialized
    
    This problem was already solved by darwin/arm64, so solve it the same
    way here for windows/arm.
    
    Fixes CL 228478.
    Fixes #42786.
