    cmd/compile: add more runtime funcs to inline test
    
    This is based from a list that Keith Randall provided in mid-2016. These
    are all funcs that, at the time, were important and small enough that
    they should be clearly inlined.
    
    The runtime has changed a bit since then. Ctz16 and Ctz8 were removed,
    so don't add them. stringtoslicebytetmp was moved to the backend, so
    it's no longer a Go function. And itabhash was moved to itabHashFunc.
    
    The only other outlier is adjustctxt, which is not inlineable at the
    moment. I've added a TODO and will address it myself in a separate
    commit.
    
    While at it, error if any funcs in the input table are duplicated.
    They're never useful and typos could lead to unintentionally thinking a
    function is inlineable when it actually isn't.
    
    And, since the lists are getting long, start sorting alphabetically.
    
    Finally, rotl_31 is only defined on 64-bit architectures, and the added
    runtime/internal/sys funcs are assembly on 386 and thus non-inlineable
    in that case.
    
    Updates #21851.
