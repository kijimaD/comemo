    src/cmd/internal/obj/wasm: optimize blocks in wasm binary
    
    This change optimizes the blocks in the wasm binary by generating the
    entryPointLoop only if it is used and adding an unwindExit block to
    be able to use the short BrIf instruction for unwinding the stack.
    These changes were suggested by the wasm-opt tool and reduce the
    wasm binary size of "hello world" by 1.5%.
