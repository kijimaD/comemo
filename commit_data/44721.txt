    net/http: set Content-Length:0 for empty PATCH requests as with POST, PATCH
    
    Sets Content-Length:0 for nil bodies in PATCH requests, as we already do for  POST and PUT requests.
    
    RFC 2616 mentions that unless a method’s Content-Length is forbidden it can send one.
    In the wild, we’ve found that Microsoft Azure’s DataLake Gen2 storage API https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/datalakestoragegen2/path/update deliberately rejects PATCH requests without a Content-Length, yet there is no workaround for setting that header when trying to flush the content of a file which was uploaded in a previous request.
    
    Fixes #40978
