commit c56b366c283f47f1aedc1bb9f8873438980eb8f7
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 3 14:05:18 2009 -0800

    Note: This is an exact replica and replacement of CL 1018027
    (which I uploaded at home and thus can't upload from here).
    CL 1018027 was reviewed.
    
    - added comments to scope.go
    - commented out some code that is not yet needed
      (and which showed up prominently in the documentation)
