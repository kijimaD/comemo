    cmd/compile: simplify limit logic in prove
    
    This replaces the open-coded intersection of limits in the prove pass
    with a general limit intersection operation. This should get identical
    results except in one case where it's more precise: when handling an
    equality relation, if the value is *outside* the existing range, this
    will reduce the range to empty rather than resetting it. This will be
    important to a follow-up CL where we can take advantage of empty
    ranges.
    
    For #23354.
