    runtime: reduce syscall.SyscallX stack usage
    
    syscall.SyscallX consumes a lot of stack space, which is a problem
    because they are nosplit functions. They used to use less stack space,
    but CL 563315, that landed in Go 1.23, increased the stack usage by a
    lot.
    
    This CL reduces the stack usage back to the previous level.
    
    Fixes #69813.
