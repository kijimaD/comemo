commit 6037c8a87745f96307bb4ffab965aa39f4cf1806
Author: Jonathan Amsterdam <jba@google.com>

    doc/next: initial contents
    
    Initialize the doc/next directory for the next release by copying the
    contents of doc/initial into it.
    
    Also, rewrite doc/README.md to add release instructions and to separate
    information for developers from information for the release team.
