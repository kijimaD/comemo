    cmd/go: avoid matching wildcards rooted outside of available modules
    
    To avoid confusion, also distinguish between packages and dirs in
    search.Match results.
    
    No test because this is technically only a performance optimization:
    it would be very difficult to write such a test so that it would not
    be flaky. (However, tested the change manually.)
    
    Fixes #37521
