    crypto/tls: reject low-order Curve25519 points
    
    The RFC recommends checking the X25519 output to ensure it's not the
    zero value, to guard against peers trying to remove contributory
    behavior.
    
    In TLS there should be enough transcript involvement to mitigate any
    attack, and the RSA key exchange would suffer from the same issues by
    design, so not proposing a backport.
    
    See #31846
