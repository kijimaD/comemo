    runtime: add copy of math.sqrt for use by arm softfloat
    
    If it's not used (such as on other systems or if softfloat
    is disabled) the linker will discard it.
    
    The alternative is to teach cmd/go that every binary
    depends on math implicitly on arm. I started down that
    path but it's too scary. If we're going to get dependencies
    right we should get dependencies right.
    
    Fixes #6994.
