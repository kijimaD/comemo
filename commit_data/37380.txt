    cmd/cgo: fix typo in gccgo name mangling recipe
    
    The code to implement new-style gccgo name mangling had a recipe that
    didn't quite match that of the compiler (incorrect handling for '.').
    This showed up as a failure in the gotools cgo test if the directory
    containing the test run included a "." character.
