    net/http: add Transport.IdleConnTimeout
    
    Don't keep idle HTTP client connections open forever. Add a new knob,
    Transport.IdleConnTimeout, and make the default be 90 seconds. I
    figure 90 seconds is more than a minute, and less than infinite, and I
    figure enough code has things waking up once a minute polling APIs.
    
    This also removes the Transport's idleCount field which was unused and
    redundant with the size of the idleLRU map (which was actually used).
