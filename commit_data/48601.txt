    cmd/link: resolve __CTOR_LIST__/__DTOR_LIST__ refs for PE
    
    When doing an internal link on Windows, it's possible to see
    unresolved references to the symbols "__CTOR_LIST__" and/or
    "__DTOR_LIST__" (which are needed in some circumstances). If these are
    still unresolved at the point where we're done reading host objects,
    then synthesize dummy versions of them.
    
    Updates #35006.
