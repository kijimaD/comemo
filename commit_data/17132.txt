    cmd/cc: use a temporary bitmap when constructing pointer maps
    
    This change makes the way cc constructs pointer maps closer to
    what gc does and is being done in preparation for changes to
    the internal content of the pointer map such as a change to
    distinguish interface pointers from ordinary pointers.
