    run.bash: set GOPATH to $GOROOT/nil before running tests
    
    Set $GOPATH to a semantically valid, non-empty string that cannot
    conflict with $GOROOT to avoid false test failures that occur when
    $GOROOT resides under $GOPATH.  Unsetting GOPATH is no longer viable
    as Go now defines a default $GOPATH that may conflict with $GOROOT.
    
    Fixes #19237
