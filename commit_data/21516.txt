    runtime: skip the gdb test if -iex is not supported
    
    It turns out -iex argument is not supported by all gdb versions,
    but as we need to add the auto-load safe path before loading the
    inferior, test -iex support first and skip the test if it's not
    available.
    
    We should still update our builders though.
