    syscall: fix fork-exec/wait inconsistencies for Plan 9
    
    Fixes the fork-exec/wait race condition for ForkExec
    as well, by making it use startProcess. This makes the
    comment for StartProcess consistent as well.
    
    Further, the passing of Waitmsg data in startProcess
    and WaitProcess is protected against possible forks
    from outside of ForkExec and StartProcess, which might
    cause interference with the Await call.
