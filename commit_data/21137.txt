    [dev.cc] 9a: make RET a synonym for RETURN; use "g" instead of "R30"
    
    Previously, 9a was the only assembler that had a different
    name for RET, causing unnecessary friction in simple files
    that otherwise assembled on all architectures.  Add RET so
    these work on 9a.
    
    This also renames "R30" to "g" to avoid unintentionally
    clobbering g in assembly code.  This parallels a change made
    to 5a.
