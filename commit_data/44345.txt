    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of sanitize.go
    
    Remove the "// UNREVIEWED" marker and add guards (as in go/types)
    to prevent data races. To see the added guards, see compare patch
    sets 3 and 4. The equivalent changes for go/types were done in
    https://golang.org/cl/294411.
