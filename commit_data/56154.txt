    cmd/go: skip TestScript/list_goroot_symlink on darwin
    
    The list_goroot_symlink test relies on fsys.Walk (and ultimately
    syscall.Lstat) conforming to POSIX pathname resolution semantics.
    POSIX requires that symlinks ending in a slash be fully resolved,
    but it appears that lstat in current darwin kernels does not fully
    resolve the last pathname component when it is a symlink to a symlink.
    
    For #59586.
    For #35678.
