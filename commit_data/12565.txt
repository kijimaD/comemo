    cmd/godoc: fix directory read
    
    Undo CL 5783076 and apply correct fix.
    
    The /doc hack is wrong.  The code to handle this case was
    already there and just needs a simple fix:
    
            // We didn't find any directories containing Go files.
            // If some directory returned successfully, use that.
    -       if len(all) == 0 && first != nil {
    +       if !haveGo {
                    for _, d := range first {
                            haveName[d.Name()] = true
                            all = append(all, d)
