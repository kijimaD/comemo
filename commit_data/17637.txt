    cmd/go: add basic docs on calling between Go and C/C++
    
    This is a framework for docs on the subject more than it is
    actual docs.
    
    The section header in go/doc.go just says "C", not "C/C++,"
    because otherwise godoc doesn't recognize the line as a
    section header.
    
    Fixes #5473.
