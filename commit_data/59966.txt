    encoding/csv: clarify that Writer uses different line break than RFC 4180 by default
    
    Package documentation of encoding/csv says:
    
    > this package supports the format described in RFC 4180.
    
    According to section 2 of RFC 4180:
    
    > Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line break (CRLF).
    
    On the other hand, Writer uses LF (not CRLF) as newline character by default.
    
    > If [Writer.UseCRLF] is true, the Writer ends each output line with \r\n instead of \n.
    
    Strictly speaking, this behavior is different from RFC 4180.
    Package documentation would improve if we clarify that point.
