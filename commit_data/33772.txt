    cmd/go: fix reuse of cached objects during cover
    
    The cover variable indices could vary from build to build,
    but they were not included in the build ID hash, so that
    reusing the previously built package was not safe.
    Make the indices no longer vary from build to build,
    so that caching is safe.
    
    Fixes #22652.
