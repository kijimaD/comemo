    cmd/internal/ld: remove pointless allocs
    
    Reduces allocs linking cmd/go and runtime.test
    by ~13%. No functional changes.
    
    The most easily addressed sources of allocations
    after this are expandpkg, rdstring, and symbuf
    string conversion.
    
    These can be reduced by interning strings,
    but that increases the overall memory footprint.
