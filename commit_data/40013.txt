    runtime: add tests for runtime mTreap
    
    This change exports the runtime mTreap in export_test.go and then adds a
    series of tests which check that the invariants of the treap are
    maintained under different operations. These tests also include tests
    for the treap iterator type.
    
    Also, we note that the find() operation on the treap never actually was
    best-fit, so the tests just ensure that it returns an appropriately
    sized span.
    
    For #30333.
