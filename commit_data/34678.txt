    crypto/rc4: optimize generic implementation slightly
    
    The compiler can't currently figure out that it can eliminate both c.s
    loads (using store to load forwarding) in the second line of the
    following code:
    
            ...
            c.s[i], c.s[j] = c.s[j], c.s[i]
            x := c.s[j] + c.s[i]
            ...
    
    The compiler eliminates the second load of c.s[j] (using the original
    value of c.s[i]), however the load of c.s[i] remains because the compiler
    doesn't know that c.s[i] and c.s[j] either overlap completely or not at
    all.
    
    Introducing temporaries to make this explicit improves the performance
    of the generic code slightly, the goal being to remove the assembly in
    this package in the future. This change also hoists a bounds check out
    of the main loop which gives a slight performance boost and also makes
    the behaviour identical to the assembly implementation when len(dst) <
    len(src).
