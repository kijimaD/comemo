    cmd/go: consolidate TestInstalls into gopath_install script test
    
    TestInstalls was already mostly redundant with
    TestInstallInto{GOPATH,GOBIN}, except for one additional check for the
    install location of cmd/fix.
    
    We can't assume that GOROOT is writable in general, so we also can't
    assume that the test will be able to reinstall cmd/fix at run time.
    Moreover, other processes running in parallel may expect to invoke
    cmd/fix themselves, so this test temporarily removing it could induce
    systemwide flakes.
    
    We could carefully construct a parallel GOROOT and install cmd/fix
    into it, but we can get *almost* as much coverage — at a much lower
    cost — by checking the output of 'go list' instead of actually
    rebuilding and reinstalling the binary.
