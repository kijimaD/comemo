    cmd/gc: fix strict tree property for AST for OAS2RECV nodes.
    
    in typecheck and walk, conversion from OAS2RECV to OAS2
    and to OSELRECV2 duplicated the ->rlist->n to ->right
    thereby destroying the strict tree-ness of the AST (up to
    ONAMES) of course.  Several recursions in esc.c and inl.c
    and probably elsewhere assume nodes of the tree aren't duplicated.
    rather than defensively code around this, i'd rather assert
    these cases away and fix their cause.
    
    (this was tripped in 6741044)
