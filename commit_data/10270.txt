    gc: use HEADER_IO macro from gopack
    
    Use HEADER_IO macro from gopack to read archive header
    The HEADER_IO macro portably reads archive headers. The
    current arsize code fails in the case of archive headers produced
    on plan 9 6c and read on other systems (it's not portable).
    Modify lex.c to use the portable macro
    Build tested (including tests) on OSX.
