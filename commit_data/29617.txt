    cmd/go: don't clobber `go env GOGCCFLAGS`
    
    When CC is set in the environment, the mkEnv function sets its version
    of CC to the first word $CC and sets GOGCCFLAGS to the remainder. That
    worked since Go 1 but was broken accidentally by
    https://golang.org/cl/6409, which changed the code such that `go env`
    calls mkEnv twice. The second call to mkEnv would clobber GOGCCFLAGS
    based on the value of CC set by the first call. Go back to the old
    handling by only calling mkEnv once.
    
    Fixes #15457.
