    cmd/compile: for location lists, handle case where prev block is not a pred
    
    Before this change, location list construction would extend
    from the previous (in linear order) block, even if was not a
    flow predecessor.  This can cause a debugger to tell lies.
    
    Fix accounts for this in block merging code by (crudely)
    "changing" all variables live from a previous block if it
    is not also a predecessor.
    
    Fixes #28486.
