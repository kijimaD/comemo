    cmd/compile: fix some C to Go translation leftovers
    
    Following the C to Go translation, some useless variables
    were left in the code. In fmt.go, this was harmless.
    In lex.go, it broke the error message related to
    non-canonical import paths.
    
    Fix it, and remove the useless variables.
    
    The added test case is ignored in the go/types tests, since
    the behavior of the non-canonical import path check seems
    to be different.
    
    Fixes #11362
