    net: disallow dialing and listening on port > 65535 on Plan 9
    
    Since Dial(":80") was implemented on Plan 9 (CL 32593),
    TestProtocolDialError is failing because dialing a port
    superior to 65535 is supported on Plan 9.
    
    This change disallows dialing and listening on ports
    superior to 65535.
    
    Fixes #17761.
