    syscall, cmd/cgo: skip tests that shouldn't run under 'unshare -n -r'
    
    A small number of tests in the main tree are currently skipped in LUCI
    because our builders there run tests without root. Unfortunately, these
    tests begin to run when run under 'unshare -n -r' as implemented in
    the current iteration of a no-network check. Add targeted builder-only
    skips so that they don't begin to run and fail with a false positive.
    
    Updates #10719.
    For #30612.
