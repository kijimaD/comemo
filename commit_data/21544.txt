    net/http: fix test to check that requests to 'localhost' are not proxied
    
    I think the test was meant to test requests to 'localhost:80' instead
    of 'localhost:80:80'. It passes even with 'localhost:80:80' because
    net.SplitHostPort fails inside useProxy. Please comment if you want to
    leave old 'localhost:80' is the list too to check old code path.
