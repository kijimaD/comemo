    net/http: deflake TestRetryRequestsOnError
    
    There's a 50ms threshold in net/http.Transport that this test
    sometimes hitting on slower devices. That was unrelated to what this
    test was trying to test. So instead just t.Skip on RoundTrip errors
    unless the failure was quick (under 25ms), in which case the error
    must've been about something else. Our fast machines should catch
    regressions there.
    
    Fixes #25366
