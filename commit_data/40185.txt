    go/internal/gccgoimporter: revise previous anonymous field fix.
    
    Revise the fix for #31540 to take into account the possibility that we
    may see an alias to a name that has already been installed into
    package scope. This scenario is not possible to reproduce with the
    current importer unit tests; changes to the harness to enable this
    scenario will be added in a later CL.
    
    Updates #31540.
