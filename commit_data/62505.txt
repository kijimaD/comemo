    crypto/tls: support bogo -wait-for-debugger
    
    When this command line flag is provided to the BoGo runner it will:
    
    * Disable some timeouts
    * Limit concurrency to 1 worker at a time
    * Pass the -wait-for-debugger flag to the shim process
    * Print the PID of the shim process to status output
    
    On the shim-side, we need to react to -wait-for-debugger by sending
    ourselves a SIGSTOP signal. When a debugger attaches to the shim the
    process will be resumed.
    
    This makes it possible to debug both the runner side and the shim side
    of a BoGo interaction without resorting to print style debugging.
    
    Since SIGSTOP is not a signal we can use on Windows this functionality
    is limited to unix builds.
