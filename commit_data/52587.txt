    Revert "net/http: close accepted connection"
    
    This reverts CL 353714.
    
    The change closes accepted connection also in graceful shutdown which
    breaks the fix for #33313 (and apparent duplicate #36819).
    
    The proper fix should close accepted connection only if server is closed
    but not in graceful shutdown.
    
    Updates #48642
