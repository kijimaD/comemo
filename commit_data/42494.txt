    cmd/go: parallellize more test cases
    
    Sprinkle in some more calls to tg.Parallel in the cmd/go
    tests. These are the easy cases that don't operate in the
    testdata directory.
    
    I think the best thing to do for those tests that do operate
    in testdata is to use the script tests. They're easier to
    read and write, and jump into t.Parallel immediately.
