    runtime: call _exit, not exit, on AIX and Solaris
    
    This is the AIX and Solaris equivalent of CL 269378.
    
    On AIX and Solaris, where we use libc for syscalls, when the runtime exits,
    it calls the libc exit function, which may call back into user code,
    such as invoking functions registered with atexit. In particular, it
    may call back into Go. But at this point, the Go runtime is
    already exiting, so this wouldn't work.
    
    On non-libc platforms we use exit syscall directly, which doesn't
    invoke any callbacks. Use _exit on AIX and Solaris to achieve the same
    behavior.
    
    Test is TestDestructorCallback.
    
    For #59711
