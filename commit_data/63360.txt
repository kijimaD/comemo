    slices: update TestIssue68488 to avoid false positives
    
    Fixes #74387
    
    Even tho we are abusing unsafe.SliceData a bit here it's probably fine;
    in case this test fail, it means some memory alias is happening
    which is not good for GC purposes.
    
    We don't care about false keep alives for stack locations tho.
