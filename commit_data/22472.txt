    runtime: factor object dumping code out of greyobject
    
    When checkmark fails, greyobject dumps both the object that pointed to
    the unmarked object and the unmarked object. This code cluttered up
    greyobject, was copy-pasted for the two objects, and the copy for
    dumping the unmarked object was not entirely correct.
    
    Extract object dumping out to a new function. This declutters
    greyobject and fixes the bugs in dumping the unmarked object. The new
    function is slightly cleaned up from the original code to have more
    natural control flow and shows a marker on the field in the base
    object that points to the unmarked object to make it easy to find.
