    runtime: rename atoi to _atoi on Plan 9
    
    Following change 2154, the goatoi function
    was renamed atoi.
    
    However, this definition conflicts with the
    atoi function defined in the Plan 9 runtime,
    which takes a []byte instead of a string.
    
    This change fixes the build on Plan 9.
