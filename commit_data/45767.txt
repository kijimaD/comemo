    cmd/go/internal/work: add missing newline to go version note
    
    A missed newline was added for one case in CL 162957, but
    the parallel no-output case was missed.
    
    Add the missed newline for the second case and update the test to
    cover the full line for both cases.
    
    Updates #30263
