    goinstall: support for Bazaar+Launchpad
    
    With these changes, goinstall is now able to use branches
    maintained with Bazaar located in Launchpad.
    
    Project aliases such as /project and /project/series are
    supported in addition to specific user or team branches
    such as /~user/project/branch.  Temporary branches under
    the +junk special project are also supported.
    
    As a curious side effect, since Launchpad is able to import
    code from other locations, they can be indirectly
    accessible too if desired.
