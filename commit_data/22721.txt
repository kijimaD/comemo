    net: dialChannel should not treat an expired deadline as noDeadline.
    
    Now, only a zero deadline is interpreted as noDeadline.  Any other time
    in the past yields an immediate timeout.
    
    TestConnectDeadlineInThePast already covers this case.  We just need to
    un-skip it for plan9, where dialChannel is used.
