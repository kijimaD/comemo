    doc: start draft of go1.19 release notes, move go1.18 to x/website
    
    This template is based on CL 342070 and previous ones like it.
    Continue to eagerly include often-used sections, and clarify that
    the TODO is about completing the section, or removing if it turns
    out not to be needed.
    
    Move the Go 1.18 release notes to x/website, since that's the new
    home for past Go release notes as of CL 291711. They're added to
    x/website in CL 388556.
    
    For #51400
    Updates #47694
