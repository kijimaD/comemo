    cmd/compile: add -d=ssa/check/seed=SEED
    
    This change adds the option to run the ssa checker with a random seed.
    The current system uses a completely fixed seed,
    which is good for reproducibility but bad for exploring the state space.
    
    Preserve what we have, but also provide a way for the caller
    to provide a seed. The caller can report the seed
    alongside any failures.
