    runtime: improve sigsend documentation
    
    I think of "sending" a signal as calling kill, but sigsend is involved
    in handling a signal and, specifically delivering it to the internal
    signal queue. The term "delivery" is already used in
    signalWaitUntilIdle, so this CL also uses it in the documentation for
    sigsend.
