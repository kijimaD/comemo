    runtime: set new m signal mask to program startup mask
    
    We were setting the signal mask of a new m to the signal mask of the m
    that created it.  That failed when that m happened to be the one created
    by ensureSigM, which sets its signal mask to only include the signals
    being caught by os/signal.Notify.
    
    Fixes #13164.
    Update #9896.
