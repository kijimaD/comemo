    cmd/link: exit before Asmb2 if error
    
    If there are already errors emitted, don't run the Asmb2 pass
    and just exit. At the point of Asmb2 relocations are already
    resolved and errors should have been reported, if any. Asmb2 is
    unlikely to emit additional useful users errors. Instead, the
    invalid input may cause inconsistencies and crash the linker, or
    it may emit some internal errors which are more confusing than
    helpful. Exit on error before Asmb2.
    
    Fixes #43748.
