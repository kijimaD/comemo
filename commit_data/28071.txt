    [dev.garbage] runtime: add gc work buffer tryGet and put fast paths
    
    The complexity of the GC work buffers put and tryGet
    prevented them from being inlined. This CL simplifies
    the fast path thus enabling inlining. If the fast
    path does not succeed the previous put and tryGet
    functions are called.
