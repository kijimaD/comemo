    cmd/internal/browser: wait 3 seconds for non-zero exit codes
    
    Wait a short period between trying commands. Many commands
    will return a non-zero exit code if the browser couldn't be launched.
    
    For example, google-chrome returns quickly with a non-zero
    exit code in a headless environment.
    
    Updates #19131.
