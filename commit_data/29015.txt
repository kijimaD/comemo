    cmd/vet: improve error message for cross-package assembly
    
    bytes.Compare has its go prototype in package bytes,
    but its implementation in package runtime.
    vet used to complain that the prototype was missing.
    Now instead:
    
    runtime/asm_amd64.s:1483: [amd64] cannot check cross-package assembly function: Compare is in package bytes
    
    Updates #11041
