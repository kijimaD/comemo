    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: removed gcCompat code needed to pass orig. tests
    
    The gcCompat mode was introduced to match the new parser's node position
    setup exactly with the positions used by the original parser. Some of the
    gcCompat adjustments were required to satisfy syntax error test cases,
    and the rest were required to make toolstash cmp pass.
    
    This change removes the former gcCompat adjustments and instead adjusts
    the respective test cases as necessary. In some cases this makes the error
    lines consistent with the ones reported by gccgo.
    
    Where it has changed, the position associated with a given syntactic construct
    is the position (line/col number) of the left-most token belonging to the
    construct.
