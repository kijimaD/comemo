    misc/vim: fix :Import insertion heuristic.
    
    If a factored import group has a blank line, assume it is dividing
    separate groups of imports (e.g. standard library vs. site-specific).
            import (
                    "bytes"
                    "io"
    
                    "mycorp/package"
            )
    
    The most common case is inserting new standard library imports,
    which are usually (stylistically) the first group, so we should drop
    "net" in the above example immediately after "io".
    
    Since this logic is getting non-trivial, add a test.
