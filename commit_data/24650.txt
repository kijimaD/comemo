    doc: adjust binary install page supported system list
    
    Make clear that this list is the list of supported systems
    for binary distributions, and that other systems may be
    able to build the distribution from source, in addition
    to using gccgo.
    
    Drop freebsd/arm from the list on this page.
    We have never issued a binary distribution for freebsd/arm,
    and we're not going to start in Go 1.5, since we don't even
    have a working builder for it.
    
    Drop freebsd/386 from the list on the page,
    because we are unable to build binary distributions, per adg.
    
    I think the wording here should probably be revised further,
    but not now.
