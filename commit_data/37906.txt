    internal/poll: handle zero-byte write in FD.WriteTo
    
    Zero-byte write was fixed by CL 132781, that was submitted 3 days ago.
    But I just submitted CL 129137, and the CL broken zero-byte write
    functionality without me noticing. CL 129137 was based on old commit
    (older than 3 days ago), and try-bots did not discover the breakage.
    
    Fix zero-byte write again.
    
    Fixes windows build.
