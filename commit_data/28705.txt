    net/http: be consistent about spelling of HTTP/1.x
    
    There was only one use of "HTTP/1.n" compared to "HTTP/1.x":
    
    h2_bundle.go://   "Just as in HTTP/1.x, header field names are strings of ASCII
    httputil/dump.go:// DumpRequest returns the given request in its HTTP/1.x wire
    httputil/dump.go:// intact. HTTP/2 requests are dumped in HTTP/1.x form, not in their
    response.go:// Write writes r to w in the HTTP/1.x server response format,
    server.go:      // Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
    server.go:// The default HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 ResponseWriter implementations
    server.go:// The default ResponseWriter for HTTP/1.x connections supports
    server.go:// http1ServerSupportsRequest reports whether Go's HTTP/1.x server
    server.go:      // about HTTP/1.x Handlers concurrently reading and writing, like
    server.go:      // HTTP/1.x from here on.
    transport.go:   return fmt.Errorf("net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: %v", err)
    
    Be consistent.
