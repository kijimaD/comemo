    [dev.link] cmd/link: expose loader PatchDWARFName hook for asm subprogram DIEs
    
    Add a new loader method PatchDWARFName to patch up live DWARF function
    DIEs during DWARF generation. This is needed to handle subprogram DIE
    symbols emitted by the assembler, which still embeds "". package
    tokens into the data sections of these dies.
    
    Note: this is expected to be a temporary hack, as we are going to
    transition the assembler to do the patching itself when passed the
    "-p" option (once this happens the plan is to toss all of the various
    PatchDWARFName helpers).
