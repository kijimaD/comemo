    internal/bytealg, runtime: provide linknames for pushed symbols
    
    The internal/bytealg package defines several symbols in the runtime,
    bytes, and strings packages in assembly, and the runtime package
    defines symbols in reflect and sync/atomic. Currently, there's no
    corresponding Go prototype for these symbols in the defining package.
    
    We're going to start depending on Go prototypes in the same package as
    their assembly definitions in order to provide ABI wrappers. Plus,
    these are good documentation and colocate type information with
    definitions, which could be useful for vet if it learned a little
    about linkname.
    
    This CL adds linknamed Go prototypes for all pushed symbols in
    internal/bytealg and runtime.
    
    For #27539.
