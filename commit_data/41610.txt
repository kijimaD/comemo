    [dev.link] cmd/link: add dupok symbols resolved to another package to textp
    
    When a dupok symbol is resolved to another package, we still need
    to record its presence in the current package, as the trampoline
    pass expects packages are laid out in dependency order. At the
    point after deadcode where we populate symbol contents for
    reachable symbols (add relocations and read symbol data), make a
    note of the dupok text symbols for each package. Later in
    addToTextp we will visit packages in dependency order, process
    the dup text symbol list for each package and select a final lib
    for each dup text symbol.
