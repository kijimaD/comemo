    cmd/internal/ld: fix symbol visibility for external linking
    
    The original C code is: (x->type & SHIDDEN) ? 2 : 0, however when
    cleaning up the code for c2go, the ternary operator is rewritten in
    the exact opposite way.
    
    We need a test for this, and that's being tracked as #10070.
    
    Fixes #10067.
