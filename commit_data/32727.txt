    cmd/compile: expand inlining test to multiple pkgs
    
    Rework the test to work with any number of std packages. This was done
    to include a few funcs from unicode/utf8. Adding more will be much
    simpler too.
    
    While at it, add more runtime funcs by searching for "inlined" or
    "inlining" in the git log of its directory. These are: addb, subtractb,
    fastrand and noescape.
    
    Updates #21851.
