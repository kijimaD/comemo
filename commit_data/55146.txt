    runtime: throw from the systemstack in wirep
    
    The exitsyscall path, since the introduction of the new execution
    tracer, stores a just little bit more data in the exitsyscall stack
    frame, causing a build failure from exceeding the nosplit limit with
    '-N -l' set on all packages (like Delve does).
    
    One of the paths through which this fails is "throw" from wirep, called
    by a callee of exitsyscall. By switching to the systemstack on this
    path, we can avoid hitting the nosplit limit, fixing the build. It's
    also not totally unreasonable to switch to the systemstack for the
    throws in this function, since the function has to be nosplit anyway. It
    gives the throw path a bit more wiggle room to dump information than it
    otherwise would have.
    
    Fixes #64113.
