commit 9c9e811bb34dc48abf256aae91af9199fb9f0f71

    spec: consistently use "indices" (rather than "indexes")
    
    We have been using all three terms "indices", "indexes",
    and "index expressions" indiscriminatly for index values.
    With this change, "index" refers to an index value,
    "indices" is the plural of "index", and "index expression"
    refers to an array, slice, or map indexed by an index: a[x].
