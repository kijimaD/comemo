    time: show how to get midnight on the current day
    
    A common task is trying to get today's date in the local time zone
    with zero values for the hour, minute, second, and nanosecond fields.
    I tried this recently and incorrectly used Truncate(24*time.Hour),
    which truncates based on a UTC clock, and gave me 5pm Pacific time
    instead of midnight Pacific.
    
    I thought it would be helpful to show a "correct" way to do this.
