    cmd/gc: return canonical Node* from temp
    
    For historical reasons, temp was returning a copy
    of the created Node*, not the original Node*.
    This meant that if analysis recorded information in the
    returned node (for example, n->addrtaken = 1), the
    analysis would not show up on the original Node*, the
    one kept in fn->dcl and consulted during liveness
    bitmap creation.
    
    Correct this, and watch for it when setting addrtaken.
    
    Fixes #7083.
