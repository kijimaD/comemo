    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: optimize constant pool for 32-bit constants
    
    Current assembler encodes "ADD $0xaaaaaaaa, Rx" to "MOVD off(PC), Rtmp"
     + "ADD Rtmp, Rx", and a 64-bit item is stored in the constant pool.
    
    This patch optimizes it to "MOVWU off(PC), Rtmp" + "ADD Rtmp, Rx",
    and a 32-bit item is stored.
    
    The total size of the executable binary go and the library files in
    pkg/linux_arm64 decreased about 3KB by this patch.
