    cmd/compile: derive unsigned limits from signed limits in prove
    
    This adds a few simple deductions to the prove pass' fact table to
    derive unsigned concrete limits from signed concrete limits where
    possible.
    
    This tweak lets the pass prove 70 additional branch conditions in std
    and cmd.
    
    This is based on a comment from the recently-deleted factsTable.get:
    "// TODO: also use signed data if lim.min >= 0".
