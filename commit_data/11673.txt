commit 9ce23548cb74fd7832794bc4d510c7fb7c379c62
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    encoding/gob: document CommonType
    Also bring the names in doc.go in line with the source.
    More radical resolutions are possible but require substantial internal
    changes for very little benefit. Fixing it this way lets us keep the
    embedding, which has a huge simplifying effect, and guarantees
    binary compatibility.
    
    Fixes #2848.
