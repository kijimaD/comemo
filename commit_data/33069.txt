    net: fix sendfile for Solaris
    
    If a retryable error such as EAGAIN/EINTR is encountered during a call
    to sendfile(), we should not assume that a partial write occurred.
    Instead, just like any other platform, we should always try again even
    if 0 bytes were written.
    
    Fixes #20857
