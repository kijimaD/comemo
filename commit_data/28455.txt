    runtime: make framepointer mode safe for Windows
    
    A few other architectures have already defined a NOFRAME flag.
    Use it to disable frame pointer code on a few very low-level functions
    that must behave like Windows code.
    
    Makes the failing os/signal test pass on a Windows gomote.
