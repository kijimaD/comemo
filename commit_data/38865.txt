    cmd/compile: always mark atColumn1 results as statements
    
    In 31618, we end up comparing the is-stmt-ness of positions
    to repurpose real instructions as inline marks. If the is-stmt-ness
    doesn't match, we end up not being able to remove the inline mark.
    
    Always use statement-full positions to do the matching, so we
    always find a match if there is one.
    
    Also always use positions that are statements for inline marks.
    
    Fixes #31618
