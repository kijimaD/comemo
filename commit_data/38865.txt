    cmd/go: add missing gccgo checks for buildmodeInit
    
    Some recent failures in gccgo on linux/ppc64 identified
    an error in buildmodeInit when buildmode=c-archive.
    A fix went into gofrontend, and this is the
    corresponding change for master. This change also includes
    two other updates related to gccgo in this function that
    were in the file from gofrontend but missing from master.
    
    Updates #29046
