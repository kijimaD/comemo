    runtime: merge timerMoving into timerModifying
    
    timerMoving is just a kind of "locked for modification",
    so merge it into timerModifying.
    
    This is part of a larger simplification of the state set.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
