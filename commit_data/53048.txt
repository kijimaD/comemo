    [dev.unified] test: relax live_regabi.go
    
    Unified IR will soon introduce additional temporary variables for
    multi-valued expressions, which cause this test to start failing.
    However, according to the comment on lines 594--596, we don't care
    what temporaries are printed on the noisy lines, just that they're not
    mentioned on the printnl lines.
    
    This CL relaxes the test expectations so that temporaries are allowed
    to be live at the call to fb38() too, not just the calls to fi38() and
    fc38().
