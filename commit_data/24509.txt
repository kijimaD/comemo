 The project welcomes submissions but please let everyone know what
-you're working on if you want it to become part of the main repository.
+you're working on if you want to change or add to the Go repositories.
 </p>
 
 <p>
-Before undertaking to write something new for the Go project, send
-mail to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts">mailing
-list</a> to discuss what you plan to do.  This gives everyone a
-chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort,
-and ensures that the idea fits inside the goals for the language
-and tools.  It also guarantees that the design is sound before code
-is written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level
-discussions.
