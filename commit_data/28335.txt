    runtime: yield after raising signal that should kill process
    
    Issue #15613 points out that the darwin builders have been getting
    regular failures in which a process that should exit with a SIGPIPE
    signal is instead exiting with exit status 2. The code calls
    runtime.raise. On most systems runtime.raise is the equivalent of
    pthread_kill(gettid(), sig); that is, it kills the thread with the
    signal, which should ensure that the program does not keep going. On
    darwin, however, runtime.raise is actually kill(getpid(), sig); that is,
    it sends a signal to the entire process. If the process decides to
    deliver the signal to a different thread, then it is possible that in
    some cases the thread that calls raise is able to execute the next
    system call before the signal is actually delivered. That would cause
    the observed error.
    
    I have not been able to recreate the problem myself, so I don't know
    whether this actually fixes it. But, optimistically:
    
    Fixed #15613.
