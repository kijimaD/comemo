    cmd/internal/obj: sort relocations
    
    At least on some platforms (e.g. PE dynamic loader) relocations
    need to be sorted in address order. Currently we don't always emit
    relocations in address order: e.g. for array literal with out-of-
    order element initializers, or out-of-order DATA instructions in
    assembly code. Sort them.
    
    No test for now as I can't reproduce the failure for #51923.
    
    Fixes #51923.
