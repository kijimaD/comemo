    spec: fix prose about terminating statements
    
    CL 85215 added prose to provide some minimal intuition for the
    definition of a "terminating statement". While the original definition
    was perfectly fine, the added prose was actually incorrect: If the
    terminating statement is a goto, it might jump to a labeled statement
    following that goto in the same block (it could be the very next
    statement), and thus a terminating statement does not in fact
    "prevent execution of all statements that lexically appear after
    it in the same block".
    
    Rather than explaining the special case for gotos with targets that
    are lexically following the goto in the same block, this CL opts for
    a simpler approach.
    
    Thanks to @3bodar (Github) for finding this.
    
    Fixes #48323.
