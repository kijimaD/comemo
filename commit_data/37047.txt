    doc: tweak example in Effective Go
    
    A prior attempt at addressing the issue got bogged down in an
    endless conversation around the subtleties of Read semantics.
    Let's not go there.
    
    Instead, we put the issue to bed, perhaps not in perfect comfort
    but well enough, by moving a line of the example so that even
    if there is a "benign" error as the issue suggests, the loop
    terminates with n and err correctly set.
    
    Fixes #27818
