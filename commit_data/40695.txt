    reflect,doc: use "the" instead of "a" in IsZero docs
    
    There is a subtle distinction between a value
    *being* the zero value vs being *equal to* the zero value.
    This was discussed at length in #31450.
    
    Using "a zero value" in the docs suggests that there may
    be more than zero value. That is possible on the "equal to
    zero value" reading, but not the "is zero" reading that we
    selected for the semantics of IsZero.
    
    This change attempts to prevent any confusion on this front by
    switching to "the zero value" in the documentation.
    
    And while we're here, eliminate a double-space.
    (Darn macbook keyboards.)
