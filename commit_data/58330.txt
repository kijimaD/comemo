    sync/atomic: add missing leak tests for And & Or
    
    Theses tests were forgot because when CL 462298 was originally written
    And & Or atomics were not available in go.
    Git were smart enough to rebase over And's & Or's addition.
    After most reviews and before merging it were pointed I should
    make theses new intrinsics noescape.
    When doing this last minute addition I forgot to add tests.
