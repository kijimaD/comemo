    net/http: add an example of creating a custom FileSystem
    
    The existing documentation of http.Dir is clear in that, if you want to hide
    your files and directories that start with a period, you must create
    a custom FileSystem. However, there are currently no example on how
    to create a custom FileSystem. This commit provides an example.
    
    Fixes #20759
