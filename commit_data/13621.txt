    exp/html: discard tags that are terminated by EOF instead of by '>'
    
    If a tag doesn't have a closing '>', it isn't considered a tag;
    it is just ignored and EOF is returned instead.
    
    Pass one additional test in the test suite.
    
    Change tokenizer tests to match correct behavior.
