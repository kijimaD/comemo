    doc: first version of new contribute guide
    
    I've reorganized the guide and rewritten large sections.
    
    The structure is now more clear and logical, and can
    be understood and navigated using the summary displayed at
    the top of the page (before, the summary was confusing because
    the guide contained H1s that were being ignored by the summary).
    
    Both the initial onboarding process and the Gerrit
    change submission process have been reworked to
    include a concise checklist of steps that can be
    read and understood in a few seconds, for people
    that don't want or need to bother with details.
    More in-depth descriptions have been moved into
    separate sections, one per each checklist step.
    This is by far the biggest improvement, as the previous
    approach of having to read several pages just to understand
    the requires steps was very scaring for beginners, in
    addition of being harder to navigate.
    
    GitHub pull requests have been integrated as a different
    way to submit a change, suggested for first time contributors.
    
    The review process has been described in more details,
    documenting the workflow and the used conventions.
    
    Most miscellanea have been moved into an "advanced
    topics" chapter.
    
    Paragraphs describing how to use git have been removed
    to simplify reading. This guide should focus on Go contribution,
    and not help users getting familiar with git, for which many
    guides are available.
