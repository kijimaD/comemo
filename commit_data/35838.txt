    reflect: remove struct tags from unexported types
    
    Before CL 4281055 in 2011, the reflect package was quite different.
    rtype, then called commonType, was embedded in exported structs with
    names like StructType. In order to avoid accidental conversions
    between pointers to these public structs, which sometimes had
    identical fields, the embedded commonType fields were tagged.
    
    In CL 4281055 the formerly public structs were unexported, and all
    access was done through the Type interface. At that point the field
    tags in the reflect structs were no longer useful.
    
    In Go 1.8 the language was changed to ignore struct field tags when
    converting between types. This made the field tags in the reflect
    structs doubly useless.
    
    This CL simply removes them.
    
    Fixes #20914
