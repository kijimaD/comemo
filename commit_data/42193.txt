    cmd/dist: remove chatty log.Print
    
    In CL 206757 I added a log.Printf to identify when GOROOT is not read-only.
    However, it interacts badly with test sharding in the builders:
    the log is repeated for every shard.
    
    Since the log statement isn't particularly high-value, just remove it.
    
    Updates #30316
