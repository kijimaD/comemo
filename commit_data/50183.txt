    cmd/compile: fix wrong position when rewriting to OpArg/OpArgXXX
    
    When spilling arg to stack or register, if it's a newly created value,
    the arg position should be preserved. Otherwise, we may end up using
    position information from deadcode lines.
    
    This fixes the minimized test case in #54625 by mdempsky@, and make
    building std successfully. However, the inline trees for these tests
    still be corrupted:
    
     - fixedbugs/issue53982.go
     - typeparam/issue47775.go
     - typeparam/issue47775b.go
     - typeparam/issue49432.go
    
    We probably still mess up the inline position somewhere else.
    
    Updates #54625
