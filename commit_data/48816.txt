    doc/go1.19: move the description of the runtime.GOROOT change from 'cmd/go' to 'runtime'
    
    Even though the change in the behavior of 'runtime.GOROOT' was
    not actually due to a change in the runtime package proper, I
    suspect that users who notice it will look for the release note
    in that section, not the 'cmd/go' section.
    
    Fixes #51461.
