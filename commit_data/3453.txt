commit 9d9a421e2452d648e8fa0264582162acf1f9fa01
Author: Adam Langley <agl@golang.org>

    Change description of time.Time.ZoneOffset to specify east is +ve.
    
    Currently, the description says that +ve numbers are westwards of UTC.
    Typically, timezones are specified with +ve numbers running east of Greenwich.
    For example, San Francisco is specified as UTC-8. Also, when calling
    time.Localtime(), the following is returned on my box in PDT:
    
    {Year:2009 Month:10 Day:5 Hour:18 Minute:55 Second:6 Weekday:1 ZoneOffset:-25200
    Zone:PDT}
    
    Note that the ZoneOffset is negative. This leads me to suspect that the
    description is mistaken.
