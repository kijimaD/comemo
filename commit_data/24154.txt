    image/jpeg: don't unread a byte if we've already taken bits from it.
    
    This rolls back most of golang.org/cl/8841, aka 2f98bac310, and makes a
    different fix. It keeps the TestTruncatedSOSDataDoesntPanic test
    introduced by that other CL, which obviously still passes after this CL.
    
    Fixes #11650, a regression (introduced by cl/8841) from Go 1.4.
    
    The original cl/8841 changed the image/jpeg not to panic on an input
    given in #10387. We still do not panic on that input, after this CL.
    
    I have a corpus of over 160,000 JPEG images, a sample of a web crawl.
    The image/jpeg code ran happily over that whole corpus both before and
    after this CL, although that corpus clearly didn't catch the regression
    in the first place.
    
    This code was otherwise tested manually. I don't think that it's trivial
    to synthesize a JPEG input that happens to run out of Huffman data at
    just the right place. The test image attached to #11650 obviously has
    that property, but I don't think we can simply add that test image to
    the repository: it's 227KiB, and I don't know its copyright status.
    
    I also looked back over the issue tracker for problematic JPEGs that
    people have filed. The Go code, after this CL, is still happy on these
    files in my directory:
    issue2362a.jpeg
    issue3916.jpeg
    issue3976.jpeg
    issue4084.jpeg
    issue4259.jpeg
    issue4291.jpeg
    issue4337.jpeg
    issue4500.jpeg
    issue4705.jpeg
    issue4975.jpeg
    issue5112.jpeg
    issue6767.jpeg
    issue9888.jpeg
    issue10133.jpeg
    issue10357.jpeg
    issue10447.jpeg
    issue11648.jpeg
    issue11650.jpeg
    
    There were other images attached in the issue tracker that aren't
    actually valid JPEGs. They failed both before and after this CL:
    broken-issue2362b.jpeg
    broken-issue6450.jpeg
    broken-issue8693.jpeg
    broken-issue10154.jpeg
    broken-issue10387.jpeg
    broken-issue10388.jpeg
    broken-issue10389.jpeg
    broken-issue10413.jpeg
    
    In summary, this CL fixes #11650 and, after some automated and manual
    testing, I don't think introduces new regressions.
