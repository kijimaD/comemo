    os: disable symlink tests on android.
    
    Creating symlinks (/data/local/tmp/*) doesn't seem to work
    on android-L (tested on nexus5). I cannot find any official
    documentation yet but just guess it's a measure for security
    attacks using symlinks.
    
    The tests failed with 'permission denied' errors.
    
    For golang/go#10807
