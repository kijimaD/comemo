    [dev.link] cmd/link: stop populating lib/unit.Textp
    
    lib.Textp was used for text address assignment and trampoline
    insertion. Now that it has been converted to using the loader,
    no need to populate lib.Textp.
    
    Port the logic of canonicalizing dupok symbol's package to the
    loader.
    
    unit.Textp was used for DWARF generation, which has also been
    converted to using the loader.
