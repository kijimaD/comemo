    cmd/dist: update isUnsupportedVMASize test skip
    
    The dist test name changed from "race" to "flag:race", "net:race",
    "os:race" and so on in CL 496181, we missed that this skip was checking
    the exact dist test name, and no builder reported a problem despite the
    skip becoming inactive.
    
    I considered deleting it as obsolete, but it may still be helpful
    if someone runs race.bash on a linux/arm64 machine configured with
    something other than the supported 48-bit VMA. So for now apply a
    simple change to restore the existing skip.
    
    Hopefully one day there will be a good way to check for unsupported VMA
    size and disable the race detector conditionally instead of relying on
    tests running, failing, and getting marked as skipped in cmd/dist.
    
    For #29948.
    For #37486.
