    cmd/internal/moddeps: use -mod=readonly instead of -mod=mod
    
    TestAllDependencies is attempting to check that the modules in GOROOT
    satisfy certain properties; it should not modify those modules itself.
    
    The “quick” part of the test checks that vendored packages are present
    and complete, without constructing a parallel GOROOT. It shouldn't
    resolve new dependencies or change formatting in any way.
    
    The longer version of the test already constructs a parallel GOROOT
    and tidies the modules within it. That part of the test will flag any
    modifications needed to the go.mod and go.sum files, without modifying
    the original GOROOT.
    
    From what I can tell, the failure mode in #46695 is caused by running
    the test on a module rooted in $GOROOT proper. There is no such module
    in the mainline Go repo, but it may have been introduced in the fork
    and could also be introduced by stray edits in contributor CLs. It
    should be diagnosed clearly.
    
    For #46695
