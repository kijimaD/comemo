    cmd/go: revert multi-flag GOFLAGS doc example
    
    This partially reverts https://golang.org/cl/135035.
    
    Reason for revert: multiple -ldflags=-foo flags simply override each
    other, since that's the logic for per-package flags. The suggested
    'GOFLAGS=-ldflags=-s -ldflags=-w' has never worked for 'go build', and
    even breaks 'go test' and 'go vet'.
    
    There should be a way to specify -ldflags='-w -s' via GOFLAGS, which is
    being tracked in #29096. For now, just remove the incorrect suggestion.
    
    Fixes #29053.
