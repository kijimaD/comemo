    net: add missing File{Conn,Listener,PacketConn} read/write tests
    
    At present, the series of File{Conn,Listener,PacketConn} APIs are the
    only way to configure platform-specific socket options such as
    SO_REUSE{ADDR,PORT}, TCP_FASTOPEN. This change adds missing test cases
    that test read and write operations on connections created by File APIs
    and removes redundant parameter tests which are already tested in
    server_test.go.
    
    Also adds comment on full stack test cases for IPConn.
    
    Fixes #10730.
