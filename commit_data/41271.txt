    syscall: avoid memory corruption in mksyscall_windows.go with *bool parameters
    
    Windows type PBOOL is a pointer to a 4 byte value, where 0 means false
    and not-0 means true. That means we should use uint32 here, not bool,
    since Go bools can be 1 byte. Since a *bool is never a "real" valid
    Windows type, converting on both in and out is probably sufficient,
    since *bool shouldn't ever be used as something with significance for
    its particular address.
