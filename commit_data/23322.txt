    runtime: dispose gcWork caches before updating controller state
    
    Currently, we only flush the per-P gcWork caches in gcMark, at the
    beginning of mark termination. This is necessary to ensure that no
    work is held up in these caches.
    
    However, this flush happens after we update the GC controller state,
    which depends on statistics about marked heap size and scan work that
    are only updated by this flush. Hence, the controller is missing the
    bulk of heap marking and scan work. This bug was introduced in commit
    1b4025f, which introduced the per-P gcWork caches.
    
    Fix this by flushing these caches before we update the GC controller
    state. We continue to flush them at the beginning of mark termination
    as well to be robust in case any write barriers happened between the
    previous flush and entering mark termination, but this should be a
    no-op.
