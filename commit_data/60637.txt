    os: fix Chtimes test flakes
    
    It appears that some builders (notably, linux-arm) have some additional
    security software installed, which apparently reads the files created by
    tests. As a result, test file atime is changed, making the test fail
    like these:
    
    === RUN   TestChtimesOmit
        ...
        os_test.go:1475: atime mismatch, got: "2024-07-30 18:42:03.450932494 +0000 UTC", want: "2024-07-30 18:42:02.450932494 +0000 UTC"
    
    === RUN   TestChtimes
        ...
        os_test.go:1539: AccessTime didn't go backwards; was=2024-07-31 20:45:53.390326147 +0000 UTC, after=2024-07-31 20:45:53.394326118 +0000 UTC
    
    According to inode(7), atime is changed when more than 0 bytes are read
    from the file. So, one possible solution to these flakes is to make the
    test files empty, so no one can read more than 0 bytes from them.
