    cmd/compile: add ability to hash-debug on file:line, including inlining
    
    Modified the fmahash gc debug flag to use this, and modified the
    test to check for a hash match that includes inlining.  Also
    made the test non-short to ensure portability.
    
    Note fma.go has been enhanced into an FMA test that requires
    two separate FMAs in order to "fail"; if either one is 2-rounding,
    then it "passes".  (It neither passes nor fails here; its role
    is to demonstrate that the FMAs are correctly reported; the
    enhanced failure mode was discovered while testing the search
    tool.)
