 // A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport)

+// When following redirects, the Client will forward all headers set on the

+//
+//	* when forwarding sensitive headers like "Authorization",
+//	  "WWW-Authenticate", and "Cookie" to untrusted targets.
+//	  These headers will be ignored when following a redirect to a domain
+//	  that is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain.
+//	  For example, a redirect from "foo.com" to either "foo.com" or "sub.foo.com"

+//	* when forwarding the "Cookie" header with a non-nil cookie Jar.
+//	  Since each redirect may mutate the state of the cookie jar,
+//	  a redirect may possibly alter a cookie set in the initial request.
+//	  When forwarding the "Cookie" header, any mutated cookies will be omitted,
+//	  with the expectation that the Jar will insert those mutated cookies
+//	  with the updated values (assuming the origin matches).
+//	  If Jar is nil, the initial cookies are forwarded without change.
