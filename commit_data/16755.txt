    encoding/json: coerce invalid UTF-8 to valid UTF-8 during Marshal
    
    In practice, rejecting an entire structure due to a single invalid byte
    in a string is just too picky, and too hard to track down.
    Be consistent with the bulk of the standard library by converting
    invalid UTF-8 into UTF-8 with replacement runes.
