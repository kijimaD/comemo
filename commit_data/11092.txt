    image: rename image.Tiled to image.Repeated.
    
    What package image currently provides is a larger image consisting
    of many copies of a smaller image.
    
    More generally, a tiled image could be a quilt consisting of different
    smaller images (like Google Maps), or a technique to view a portion of
    enormous images without requiring the whole thing in memory.
    
    This richer construct might not ever belong in the standard library (and
    is definitely out of scope for Go 1), but I would like the option for
    image.Tiled to be its name.
