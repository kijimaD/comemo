    cmd/link: do not align type name data
    
    Now that reflect.name objects contain an offset to pkgPath instead of a
    pointer, there is no need to align the symbol data.
    
    Removes approx. 10KB from the cmd/go binary. The effect becomes more
    important later as more type data is moved into name objects.
    
    For #6853
