    cmd/compile: clarify Node.NonNil and Node.Bounded
    
    Node.NonNil and Node.Bounded were a bit muddled. This led to #38496.
    This change clarifies and documents them.
    
    It also corrects one misuse.
    However, since ssa conversion doesn't make full use of the bounded hint,
    this correction doesn't change any generated code.
    The next change will fix that.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
