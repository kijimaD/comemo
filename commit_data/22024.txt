    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: add ppc64
    
    Fairly straightforward. A couple of unusual addressing tricks.
    Also added the ability to write R(10) to mean R10. PPC64 uses
    this for a couple of large register spaces. It appears for ARM now
    as well, since I saw some uses of that before, although I rewrote
    them in our source. I could put it in for 386 and amd64 but it's
    not worth it.
