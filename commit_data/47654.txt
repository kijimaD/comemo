    runtime: fix riscv64 sigaction mask field offset
    
    The Linux kernel for riscv64 does not include an sa_restorer field on
    its sigaction struct, and expects sa_mask to come immediately after the
    sa_flags field. Arrange the fields of the sigaction struct that are
    known to the kernel so they appear at the correct byte offsets, and so
    they agree with the output of "go tool cgo -godefs".
    
    Follow the example set by the mips/mipsle port to leave the sa_restorer
    field in place, but at an offset where it won't hurt anything.
    
    Fixes #49709
