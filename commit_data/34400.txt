    cmd/link: only adjust pagezero for iOS on darwin/arm64
    
    The new pagezero_size introduced by CL 72730 breaks
    on 32-bit systems, since it is 2³². Restrict the change to
    darwin/arm64, since it is intended for iOS only.
    
    We could plausibly allow GOARCH=amd64 as well, but
    without a compelling reason, changing the zero page size
    doesn't seem worth the risk.
