    cmd/go: simplify/fix handling private github repos
    
    Before Go 1.4, the traditional way to work with a private Github
    repository was to run something similar the following:
    
    ```
    git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
    ```
    
    It would allow go get and friends to transparently work as expected,
    automatically rewriting https URLs to use SSH for auth. This worked both
    when pushing and pulling.
    
    In Go 1.4 this broke, now requiring the use of `go get -f` instead of `go get`
    in order to fetch private repositories. This seems neither intended nor
    practical, as it requires changing a lot of tooling.
    
    So just use `git config remote.origin.url` instead of `git remote -v` as
    this reflects the actual substitution intended in the `insteadOf` config
    directive.
    
    Also remove now useless parsing.
    
    Also add a check against supported schemes to avoid errors in later
    commands using this URL and expecting such a scheme.
    
    Fixes #9697
