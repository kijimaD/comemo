commit bfd5ede78def5e6fe0d0f6f9169daed6deee2d91

    add -P pkgdir option to 6l to have it look first in pkgdir for a package.
    this allows gotest to find the locally built package when doing
            make
            gotest
    without this option, one would have to say
            make install
            gotest
    which kinda defeats the purpose
    
    based on discussions with rsc.
