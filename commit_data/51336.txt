    cmd/dist: skip non-race tests
    
    In -race mode, the dist test command only registers the std, race,
    osusergo, and amd64ios tests before returning early from
    (*tester).registerTests. Prior to CL 450018, the osusergo and amd64ios
    tests weren't even affected by -race mode, so it seems their inclusion
    was unintentional. CL 450018 lifted the logic to run tests in race
    mode, which means these tests went from running without -race to
    running with -race. Unfortunately, amd64ios is not compatible with
    -race, so it is now failing on the darwin-amd64-race builder.
    
    Fix this by omitting the osusergo and amd64ios tests from -race mode,
    since it seems like they were really intended to be included anyway.
    
    This should fix the darwin-amd64-race builder.
    
    Updates #37486.
