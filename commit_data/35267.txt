    cmd/compile: don't inline functions that call recover
    
    recover determines whether it's being called by a deferred frame by
    matching its caller's argument frame pointer with the one recorded in
    the panic object. That means its caller needs a valid and unique
    argument frame pointer, so it must not be inlined.
    
    With this fix, test/recover.go passes with -l=4.
    
    Fixes #23557.
