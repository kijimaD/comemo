    syscall: fix build on freebsd/arm
    
    This CL is in preparation to make cgo work on freebsd/arm.
    
    It's just for fixing build fails on freebsd/arm, we still need to
    update z-files later for fixing several package test fails.
    
    How to generate z-files on freebsd/arm in the bootstrapping phase:
    1. run freebsd on appropriate arm-eabi platforms
    2. both syscall z-files and runtime def-files in the current tree are
       broken about EABI padding, fix them by hand
    3. run make.bash again to build $GOTOOLDIR/cgo
    4. use $GOTOOLDIR/cgo directly
