    testing: show in-progress tests upon SIGINT
    
    Because of parallel tests, which have stalled executions, the RUN
    output of a test can be much earlier than its completion output resulting
    in hard-to-read verbose output.
    
    The tests are displayed in the order in which the output shows
    that they began, to make it easy to line up with the "RUN" output.
    Similarly, the definitions of when tests begin and complete is
    determined by when RUN and FAIL/SKIP/PASS are output since the
    focus of this code is on enhancing readability.
    
    Fixes #19397
