    runtime: comment out breakpoint in windows/386 sighandler
    
    This code being buggy is the only explanation I can come up
    with for issue 7325. It's probably not, but the only alternative
    is a Windows kernel bug. Comment this out to see what breaks
    or gets fixed.
    
    Update #7325
