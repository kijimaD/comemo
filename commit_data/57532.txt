    cmd/dist: enforce the lowest bootstrap version
    
    The go1.24 release notes say that go1.22.6 is the
    minimum bootstraps required,
    the go team also use go1.22.6 bootstraps in testing,
    so if there's a problem with using an older version,
    automated testing won't uncover it.
    
    Now enforce this in dist to avoid
    release notes that do not match reality, which can be confusing.
    
    For #64751
