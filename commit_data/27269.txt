    testing: hoisted chunks of code to prepare for Run method
    
    testing.go:
    - run method will evolve into the Run method.
    - added level field in common
    
    benchmark.go:
    - benchContext will be central to distinguish handling of benchmarks
      between normal Run methods and ones called from within Benchmark
      function.
    - expandCPU will evolve into the processing hook for Run methods
      called within normal processing.
    - runBench will evolve into the Run method.
