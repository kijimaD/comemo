    cmd/link: fix accidentally-quadratic library loading
    
    Programs built from N libraries required O(NÂ²) time to do the
    deduplication checks, even if there were never any duplicates.
    In most programs N is small enough not to worry, but this may
    affect large programs.
    
    Noticed by inspection, not any specific bug report.
    
    Fixes #20578.
