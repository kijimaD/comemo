    runtime: shared library init support for android/arm.
    
    Follows http://golang.org/cl/8454, a similar CL for arm architectures.
    This CL involves android-specific changes, namely, synthesizing
    argv/auxv, as android doesn't provide those to the init functions.
    
    This code is based on crawshaw@ android code in golang.org/x/mobile.
