    cmd/compile: don't bother compiling functions named "_"
    
    They can't be used, so we don't need code generated for them. We just
    need to report errors in their bodies.
    
    The compiler currently has a bunch of special cases sprinkled about
    for "_" functions, because we never generate a linker symbol for them.
    Instead, abort compilation earlier so we never reach any of that
    special-case code.
    
    Fixes #29870
