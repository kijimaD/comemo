    misc/vim: Document better syntax sync parameter
    
    Forcing the synchronization of 500 lines is both slower and
    less precise than searching for a known sync point.
    Unfortunately, though, the way to synchronize correctly is
    using the grouphere instruction, which has a bug.
    
    I've already proposed the fix to Vim, so future releases
    should have this working.  We can continue using the 500 lines
    syncing for now.
    
    This change just documents the proper way to sync.
