    [dev.typealias] go/types: implement type aliases
    
    Now a TypeName is just that: a name for a type (not just Named and Basic types
    as before). If it happens to be an alias, its type won't be a Named or Basic type,
    or it won't have the same name. We can determine this externally.
    
    It may be useful to provide a helper predicate to make that test easily accessible,
    but we can get to that if there's an actual need.
    
    The field/method lookup code has become more general an simpler, which is a good sign.
    The changes in methodset.go are symmetric to the changes in lookup.go.
    
    Known issue: Cycles created via alias types are not properly detected at the moment.
    
    For #18130.
