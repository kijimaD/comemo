    cmd/pprof: Re-enable weblist and disasm
    
    Previous changes started using the full filename for object files
    on graph nodes, instead of just the file basename. The basename
    was still being used when selecting mappings to disassemble for
    weblist and disasm commands, causing a mismatch.
    
    This fixes #18385. It was already fixed on the upstream pprof.
