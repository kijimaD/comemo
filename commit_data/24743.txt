    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: fix OANDAND and OOROR type
    
    The old backend doesn't like ideal types,
    and we want to reuse its stackmap generation.
    
    OOROR and OANDAND expressions have ideal type.
    The old backend didn't care,
    because those expressions got rewritten away into
    jumps before stackmap generation.
    
    Fix the type during conversion.
