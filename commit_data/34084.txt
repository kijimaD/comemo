    cmd/dist: change mkdeps to be more merge-friendly
    
    In addition to the obvious formatting change, this also drops
    from deps.go any indirect dependencies, so that when you add
    a new import to one package, the resulting diff only affects that
    one package, not every package that imports that package
    directly or indirectly. That makes the file a bit easier to understand,
    if you need to debug it or deal with a possible merge conflict.
    
    The code to trim the import lists (but not too much) was more
    than I wanted to do in shell, so I rewrote mkdeps in Go.
    
    The shell script is left behind for backwards-compatibility with
    people who have learned to run ./mkdeps.bash (or documentation
    suggesting the same).
