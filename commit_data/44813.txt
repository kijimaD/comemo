    cmd/cgo: document #include <> search path behaviour
    
    cgo effectively prepends -I${SRCDIR} to the header include path of all
    preambles it processes, so when an #include <> matches a header file
    both in the source directory and also another include directory, the
    local copy will be used in preference.
    
    This behaviour is surprising but unfortunately also longstanding and
    relied upon by packages in the wild, so the best we can do is to
    document it.
    
    Fixes #41059
