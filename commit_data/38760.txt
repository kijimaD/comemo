    cmd/compile: use correct store types in softfloat
    
    When using softfloat, floating point ops are rewritten to integer
    ops. The types of store ops were not rewritten. This may lower
    to floating point stores, which are problematic. This CL fixes
    this by rewriting the store types as well.
    
    This fixes test/fixedbugs/issue28688.go on Wasm. Softfloat mode
    is not used by default on Wasm, and it is not needed as Wasm spec
    supports floating points. But it is nice to have the correct
    types.
