commit 47919799b411f0c1e47591887a233d3692bf19b6
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 16 19:14:33 2008 -0700

    new grammar:
            binary <- is send
            unary <- is recv
            -< is gone
            case a := <-ch: works in select
            case a = <-ch: works in select
    support for new cases is not yet in the compiler but all non-select
    code works
    
    second CL will update affected go source
    
    R=ken
    OCL=15414
    CL=15414
