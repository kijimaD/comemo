    cmd/gc, runtime: make assertI2T and variants not variadic
    
    A side effect of this change is that when assertI2T writes to the
    memory for the T being extracted, it can use typedmemmove
    for write barriers.
    
    There are other ways we could have done this, but this one
    finishes a TODO in package runtime.
    
    Found with GODEBUG=wbshadow=2 mode.
    Eventually that will run automatically, but right now
    it still detects other missing write barriers.
