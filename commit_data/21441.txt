    runtime: rearrange framepointer check condition
    
    The test for the framepointer experiment flag is cheaper and more
    branch-predictable than the other parts of this conditional, so move
    it first.  This is also more readable.
    
    (Originally, the flag check required parsing the experiments string,
    which is why it was done last.  Now that flag is cached.)
