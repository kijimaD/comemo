    cmd/internal/obj/loong64: remove Optab.family and reorganize operand class fields
    
    There is currently no support for GOARCH=loong32, so the Optab.family
    field is unused so far. Remove it to simplify the optab; the loong
    assembler backend would likely already be overhauled into a sufficiently
    different shape by the time we start to care for loong32, that the data
    we have today would be useless anyway.
    
    While at it, add a operand class slot for the 3rd source operand
    (support for which will arrive in later commits), and rename the other
    operand class fields to be self-documenting. The changes are being
    merged into this patch for sake of reducing code churn.
