    spec: use "core type" rather than "structural type"
    
    This change in terminology prevents potential confusion
    that migth be caused by associating "structural type"
    with "structural typing"; the two are not connected.
    
    Also, adjusted introductory paragraph of section on
    constraint type inference: type inference goes in both
    directions, from type parameter to core type and vice
    versa. The previous description was not quite accurate.
