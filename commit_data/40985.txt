    cmd/go: restore default vet analyzers for targets in GOROOT
    
    This fixes a regression introduced in CL 209498,
    found while investigating #32471.
    
    Also fix $WORK replacement in cmd/go/internal/work.(*Builder).Showcmd
    when b.WorkDir includes a backslash and appears in a quoted string.
    That fix is needed in order to write a precise test that passes under Windows,
    since Windows directories nearly always include backslashes.
    
    Updates #35837
