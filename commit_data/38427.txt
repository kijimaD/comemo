    os: remove sleep in windows Process.Wait
    
    The wait was there, because we discovered that we could not remove
    finished process executable without the wait on Windows XP. But
    Windows XP is not supported by Go. Maybe we do not need the wait
    with modern Windows versions. Remove the sleep.
    
    Fixes #25965
