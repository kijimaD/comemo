    test: check that size argument errors are emitted at call site
    
    Add tests for the "negative size argument in make.*" and "size argument
    too large in make.*" error messages to appear at call sites in case the
    size is a const defined on another line.
    
    As suggested by Matthew in a comment on CL 69910.
