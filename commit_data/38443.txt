    bufio: suggest io.ReadFull at (*Reader).Read
    
    Many times when using bufio.Reader I imagine, incorrectly, that it
    implements the retry loop itself, being a high-level buffered wrapper
    around, say, a file descriptor prone to short reads. This comment
    would have saved me much time.
