commit 485673188dc6c3ee3113990ed1e96ca8f8f0df51
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    spec: type assertions and type switches must be valid
    
    The spec didn't preclude invalid type assertions and
    type switches, i.e., cases where a concrete type doesn't
    implement the interface type in the assertion in the first
    place. Both, the gc and gccgo compiler exclude these cases.
    This is documenting the status quo.
    
    Also:
    - minor clean up of respective examples
    - added sentence about default case in select statements
    
    Fixes #4472.
