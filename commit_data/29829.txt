    runtime: update mkduff legacy comments
    
    Update comments for duffzero and duffcopy
    which referred to legacy locations:
    + cmd/?g/cgen.go
    + cmd/?g/ggen.go
    
    Remnants of the old days when we had 5g, 6g etc.
    
    Those locations have since moved to:
    + cmd/compile/internal/<arch>/cgen.go
    + cmd/compile/internal/<arch>/ggen.go
