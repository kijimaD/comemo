    [dev.link] cmd/link: fix aux symbol handling in Funcdata
    
    If a Go symbol is cloned to external, we should preserve its Aux
    symbols for FuncInfo, etc.. We already do this in
    loader.FuncInfo, but not in FuncInfo.Funcdata. Do it in the
    latter as well. In fact, since FuncInfo and Funcdata should use
    the same set of auxs, just record the auxs and reuse.
    
    Should fix PPC64 build.
