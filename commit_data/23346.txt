    crypto/tls: fix parsing of SNI extension.
    
    The previous code had a brain fart: it took one of the length prefixes
    as an element count, not a length. This didn't actually affect anything
    because the loop stops as soon as it finds a hostname element, and the
    hostname element is always the first and only element. (No other element
    types have ever been defined.)
    
    This change fixes the parsing in case SNI is ever changed in the future.
    
    Fixes #10793.
