    cmd/dist: emit \r in env -w output
    
    go tool dist env -w is supposed to print a Windows batch file.
    Normally Windows will execute batch files without \r before \n,
    but issue 3060 reports that if the file ends up containing paths
    written in Chinese, Windows 7 cannot execute it without the \r.
    So add the \r.
    
    Fixes #3060.
