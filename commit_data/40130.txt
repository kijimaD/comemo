    crypto/x509: truncate signed hash before DSA signature verification
    
    According to spec, the hash must be truncated, but crypto/dsa
    does not do it. We can't fix it in crypto/dsa, because it would break
    verification of previously generated signatures.
    In crypto/x509 however, go can't generate DSA certs, only verify them,
    so the fix here should be safe.
    
    Fixes #22017
