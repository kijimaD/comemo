    doc/go1.16: announce netbsd/arm64 support
    
    netbsd/arm64 now complies with all the requirements for a port as
    specified on https://golang.org/wiki/PortingPolicy
    
    Note that this was preliminarily announced in the Go 1.13 release notes
    (CL 183637) but then removed again due to the port lacking a builder at
    that time (CL 192997).
    
    Updates #30824
