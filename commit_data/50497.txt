    cmd/go: test with SIGTERM in test_fuzz_non_crash_signal
    
    The test currently uses only SIGKILL (which cannot be trapped by the
    worker process) and SIGILL (which is handled by the Go runtime, and
    does pretty unambiguously indicate a crash). It is missing a third
    (and perhaps more likely) case: a signal like SIGTERM that is handled
    by the Go runtime and causes the test to terminate, but nonetheless
    does not indicate a crash.
