    cmd/compile: remove special treatment for cover vars in initorder
    
    This patch reverts a portion of the changes in CL 443715, specifically
    the code in initorder that treats coverage counter variables as special
    with respect to init order. The special casing is no longer needed
    now after a change to the way coverage instrumention is done (the go and
    cover cmds now make sure that coverage variables appear first in
    the compilation order).
    
    Updates #56293.
