    doc: adjust installation instructions dynamically for a given download
    
    This change allows the download page to redirect the user to
    /doc/install?download=filename so the user can see installation
    instructions specific to the file they are downloading.
    
    This change also expands the "Test your Go installation" section
    to instruct the user to create a workspace, hopefully leading
    to less confusion down the line.
    
    It also changes the front page download link to go directly
    to the downloads page, which will in turn take them to the
    installation instructions (the original destination).
    
    This is related to this change to the tools repo:
