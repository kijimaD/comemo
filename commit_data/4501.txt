commit 9d07d37f317c2e58204c8aa2def2d8067133633b
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 28 15:48:58 2009 -0800

    A couple of tighter loops.
    
    (I was looking at this code accidentally because of some gofmt
    issues and thought that one could write this more effectively.
    You may have deliberately chosen not to use ranges here to make
    the index range clearer. Just let me know.)
