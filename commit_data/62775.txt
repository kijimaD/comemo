    os: clean-up NewFile tests
    
    This CL removes some unnecessary code and duplicated NewFile tests
    cases.
    
    It also simplifies TestPipeCanceled by removing the need for using
    SetReadDeadline. Using CancelIoEx instead of CancelIo makes the cancel
    operations to finish almost instantly. The latter could take more than
    20s to finish if called from a thread different from the one that
    called ReadFile.
