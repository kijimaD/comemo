    spec: fix spec on conversions to match implementations
    
    The existing compilers convert empty strings to empty
    but non-nil byte and rune slices. The spec required
    a nil byte and rune slice in those cases. That seems
    an odd additional requirement. Adjust the spec to
    match the reality.
    
    Also, removed over-specification for conversions of
    nil []byte and []rune: such nil slices already act
    like empty slices and thus don't need extra language.
    Added extra examples instead.
    
    Fixes #5704.
