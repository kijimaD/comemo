    [dev.link] cmd/link: better naming for Loader container/subsym methods, part 2 of 2
    
    Introduce a new loader method "SetCarrierSym", to be used when
    establishing container/containee symbol relationships for symbol
    bucketing in the symtab phase.
    
    This new method is intended to be employed in situations where you
    have a series of related symbols will be represented by a single
    carrier symbol as a combined entity. The pattern here is that the
    sub-symbols contain content but will be anonymous from a symbol table
    perspective; the carrier symbol has no content itself but will appear
    in the symbol table. Examples of carrier symbols that follow this
    model are "runtime.itablink" and "runtime.typelink".
