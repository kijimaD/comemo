    cmd/go: skip TestScript/mod_replace_gopkgin
    
    (Until it can be made hermetic.)
    
    The gopkg.in service has had a lot of flakiness lately. Go users in
    general are isolated from that flakiness by the Go module mirror
    (proxy.golang.org), but this test intentionally bypasses the module
    mirror because the mirror itself uses cmd/go to download the module.
    
    In the long term, we can redirect the gopkg.in URL to the local
    (in-process) vcweb server added for #27494.
    
    In the meantime, let's skip the test to reduce the impact of upstream
    outages.
    
    For #54503.
