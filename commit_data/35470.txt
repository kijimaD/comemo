    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: don't assume (operator) ~ means operator ^
    
    The scanner assumed that ~ really meant ^, which may be helpful when
    coming from C. But ~ is not a valid Go token, and pretending that it
    should be ^ can lead to confusing error messages. Better to be upfront
    about it and complain about the invalid character in the first place.
    
    This was code "inherited" from the original yacc parser which was
    derived from a C compiler. It's 10 years later and we can probably
    assume that people are less confused about C and Go.
    
    Fixes #23587.
