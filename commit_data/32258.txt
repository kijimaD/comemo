    cmd/internal/obj: unify Setuintxx and WriteInt
    
    They do basically the same work.
    
    Setuintxx was only used in a single place,
    so eliminate it in favor of WriteInt.
    
    duintxxLSym's alignment rounding was not used in practice;
    change it into alignment assertion.
    
    Passes toolstash-check. No compiler performance changes.
