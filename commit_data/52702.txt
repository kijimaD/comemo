    misc/cgo: invoke "go" from $GOROOT/bin instead of $PATH
    
    If PATH doesn't contain GOROOT/bin as the first element, this could
    otherwise end up running entirely the wrong command (and from the
    wrong GOROOT, even).
    
    I pre-tested this change on release-branch.go1.17 using a gomote.
    I believe that it will fix the test failure on that branch,
    but will need to be backported.
    
    For #52995.
