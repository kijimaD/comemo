    debug/elf: don't apply DWARF relocations for ET_EXEC binaries
    
    Some ET_EXEC binaries might have relocations for non-loadable sections
    like .debug_info. These relocations must not be applied, because:
    * They may be incorrect
    * The correct relocations were already applied at link time
    
    Binaries in Linux Kernel debug packages like Fedora/Centos kernel-debuginfo
    are such examples. Relocations for .debug_* sections are included in the
    final binaries because they are compiled with --emit-relocs, but the resulting
    relocations are incorrect and shouldn't be used when reading DWARF sections.
    
    Fixes #46673
