    runtime: bound small object sweeping to 100 spans when allocating
    
    Currently, the small object sweeper will sweep until it finds a free
    slot or there are no more spans of that size class to sweep. In dense
    heaps, this can cause sweeping for a given size class to take
    unbounded time, and gets worse with larger heaps.
    
    This CL limits the small object sweeper to try at most 100 spans
    before giving up and allocating a fresh span. Since it's already shown
    that 100 spans are completely full at that point, the space overhead
    of this fresh span is at most 1%.
    
    This CL is based on an experimental CL by Austin Clements (CL 187817)
    and is updated to be part of the mcentral implementation, gated by
    go115NewMCentralImpl.
    
    Updates #18155.
