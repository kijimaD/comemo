    crypto/elliptic: delete outdated fuzz test
    
    It had not been doing anything since CL 233939, because the Params
    method was getting upgraded to the assembly one. We could make it use
    genericParamsForCurve, but really we need lower-level, targeted Go 1.18
    fuzz targets in nistec now.
