    crypto/tls: replace custom equal implementations with reflect.DeepEqual
    
    The equal methods were only there for testing, and I remember regularly
    getting them wrong while developing tls-tris. Replace them with simple
    reflect.DeepEqual calls.
    
    The only special thing that equal() would do is ignore the difference
    between a nil and a zero-length slice. Fixed the Generate methods so
    that they create the same value that unmarshal will decode. The
    difference is not important: it wasn't tested, all checks are
    "len(slice) > 0", and all cases in which presence matters are
    accompanied by a boolean.
