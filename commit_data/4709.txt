+
+<pre>
+There are two small language changes: the meaning of chan <- chan int
+is now defined, and functions returning functions do not need to 
+parenthesize the result type.
+
+There is one significant implementation change: the compilers can
+handle multiple packages using the same name in a single binary.
+In the gc compilers, this comes at the cost of ensuring that you
+always import a particular package using a consistent import path.
+In the gccgo compiler, the cost is that you must use the -fgo-prefix
+flag to pass a unique prefix (like the eventual import path).
+
