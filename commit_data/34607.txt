    net/http: clarify when it is safe to reuse a request
    
    The godoc for RoundTrip already specifies when it's ok to reuse a
    request that contains a body: the caller must wait until RoundTrip
    calls Close on Request.Body.
    
    This CL adds a small clarification: If the request does not have a
    body, it can be reused as long as the caller does not mutate the
    Request until RoundTrip fails or the Response.Body is closed.
    
    Fixes #19653
