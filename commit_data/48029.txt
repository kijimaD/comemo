    os: depend on Readlink only when necessary
    
    Currently Readlink gets linked into the binary even when Executable is
    not needed.
    
    This reduces a simple "os.Stdout.Write([]byte("hello"))" by ~10KiB.
    
    Previously the executable path was read during init time, because
    deleting the executable would make "Readlink" return "(deleted)" suffix.
    There's probably a slight chance that the init time reading would return
    it anyways.
    
    Updates #6853
