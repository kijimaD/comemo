    cmd/compile: Improve readability of HTML produced by GOSSAFUNC
    
    Factor out the Aux/AuxInt handling in (*Value).LongString() and
    use it in (*Value).LongHTML() as well.
    This especially improves readability of auxFloat32, auxFloat64,
    and auxSymValAndOff values which would otherwise be printed as
    opaque integers.
    This change also makes LongString() slightly less verbose by
    eliding offsets that are zero (as is very often the case).
    
    Additionally, ensure the HTML is interpreted as UTF-8 so that
    non-ASCII characters (especially the "middle dots" in some symbols)
    show up correctly.
