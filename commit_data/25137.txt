    dwbug/elf: support old-style compressed DWARF
    
    GCC and LLVM support zlib-compressing DWARF debug sections (and
    there's some evidence that this may be happening by default in some
    circumstances now).
    
    Add support for reading compressed DWARF sections. Since ELF
    relocations apply to the decompressed data, decompression is done
    before applying relocations. Since relcations are applied by
    debug/elf, decompression must also be handled there.
    
    Note that this is different from compressed ELF sections, which is a
    more general mechanism used by very recent versions of GCC.
    
    Updates #11773.
