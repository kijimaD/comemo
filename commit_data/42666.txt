    cmd/go: don't initialize Builder in envcmd.MkEnv
    
    The Builder isn't needed by MkEnv, and Builder.Init doesn't have side
    effects that change the environment. Builder.Init does currently call
    CheckGOOSARCHPair, but that's being moved out in CL 234658.
    
    Builder.Init creates the temporary work directory used by the
    builder. For the builder created in MkEnv, this directory is never
    used. Creating this directory can cause unnecessary errors for
    commands that don't use a builder like 'go clean' and 'go list'.
    
    Fixes #38395
    Updates #24398
