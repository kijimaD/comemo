    cmd/go/internal/workcmd: remove a potentially confusing statement
    
    A statement in the go work use docs that was meant to clarify that go
    work use would clean up use statements where the directories did not
    exist ended up causing confusion.
    
    Remove that statement for now. We might want to add something back in
    the future.
    
    For #68245
