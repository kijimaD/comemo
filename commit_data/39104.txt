    cmd/compile: fix deriving from x+d >= w on overflow in prove pass
    
    In the case of x+d >= w, where d and w are constants, we are
    deriving x is within the bound of min=w-d and max=maxInt-d. When
    there is an overflow (min >= max), we know only one of x >= min
    or x <= max is true, and we derive this by excluding the other.
    When excluding x >= min, we did not consider the equal case, so
    we could incorrectly derive x <= max when x == min.
    
    Fixes #29502.
