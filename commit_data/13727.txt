commit 18aa55c169774b96b210f234e88c98e78a1c513f
Author: Marcel van Lohuizen <mpvl@golang.org>

    exp/locale/collate: first changes that introduce implementation of tailorings:
    - Elements in the array are now sorted as a linked list.  This makes it easier to
      apply tailorings.
    - Added code to sort entries by collation elements.
    - Added logical reset points.  This is used for tailoring relative to certain
      properties, rather than characters.
    
    NOTE: all code for type entry should now be in order.go.  To keep the diffs for
    this CL reasonable, though, the existing code is left in builder.go.  I'll move
    this in a separate CL.
