    internal/trace: use the correct stack for goroutine naming in v2 traces
    
    Currently goroutine names are determined (for v2 traces) by
    internal/tracev/2.Event.Stack, but this is wrong in general. For
    example, if we end up seeing a transition from GoNotExist->GoRunnable
    (goroutine creation) then we're taking the stack from the creator, not
    the created goroutine (which is what we're naming at that point).
    
    Use the StateTransition.Stack instead. This is always the correct one to
    use because we're always naming the goroutine that the state transition
    is for.
