    undo CL 13321048 / 9567c5da6e25
    
    Makes build unnecessarily slower. Will fix the parser instead.
    
    ««« original CL description
    runtime/pprof: run TestGoroutineSwitch for longer
    
    Short test now takes about 0.5 second here.
    
    Fixes #6417.
    
    The failure was also seen on our builders.
