    exp/html: fix foster-parenting when elements are implicitly closed
    
    When an element (like <nobr> or <p>) was implicitly closed by another
    start tag, it would keep foster parenting from working because
    the check for what was on top of the stack of open elements was
    in the wrong place.
    
    Move the check to addChild.
    
    Pass 2 additional tests.
