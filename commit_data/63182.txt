    crypto: add a test for disallowed instructions
    
    WORD and BYTE usage in crypto assembly cores is an anti-pattern which
    makes extremely sensitive code significantly harder to understand, and
    can result in unexpected behavior.
    
    Because of this, we've decided to ban their usage in the crypto/ tree
    (as part of the cryptography assembly policy).
    
    This test walks the crypto/ tree looking for assembly files (those with
    the filetype .s) and look for lines that match the regular rexpression
    "(^|;)\s(BYTE|WORD)\s".
