    runtime: symbolize morestack caller in throwsplit panic
    
    This attempts to symbolize the PC of morestack's caller when there's a
    stack split at a bad time. The stack trace starts at the *caller* of
    the function that attempted to grow the stack, so this is useful if it
    isn't obvious what's being called at that point, such as in #21431.
