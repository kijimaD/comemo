    cmd/6g: inline copies of up to 4 words in length.
    
    This change fixes a serious performance regression
    with reflect.Value growing to 4 words instead of 3.
    The json benchmark was ~50% slower, with this change
    it is ~5% slower (and the binary is 0.5% larger).
    
    Longer term, we probably need to rethink our copy
    generation.  Using REP is really expensive time-wise.
    But inlining the copy grows the binary.
