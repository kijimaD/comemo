    vet: improve flag handling
    Simplify the internal logic for flags controlling what to vet,
    by introducing a map of flags that gathers them all together.
    This change should simplify the process of adding further flags.
    
    Add a test for untagged struct literals.
    Delete a redundant test that was also in the wrong file.
    Clean up some ERROR patterns that weren't working.
    
    "make test" passes again.
