    cmd/dist: remove extraneous '-i' from 'go test -race' command
    
    At one point (before GOCACHE), the '-i' flag meant, effectively,
    “save the intermediate results of this command to make
    future commands faster”.
    
    However, now that we require GOCACHE to be enabled everywhere, '-i' no
    longer has that meaning: the intermediate results are already saved in
    GOCACHE, so the -i flag merely adds extra work (copying or linking
    things from GOCACHE into pkg), and also adds additional failure modes
    resulting from that extra work (particularly when 'pkg' is read-only).
    
    Since the flag now causes more harm than good, omit it.
