    runtime: set g to gsignal before adjustSignalStack
    
    When a signal is received, the runtime probes whether an
    alternate signal stack is set, if so, adjust gsignal's stack to
    point to the alternate signal stack. This is done in
    adjustSignalStack, which calls sigaltstack "syscall", which is a
    libc call on darwin through asmcgocall. asmcgocall decides
    whether to do stack switch based on whether we're running on g0
    stack, gsignal stack, or regular g stack. If g is not set to
    gsignal, asmcgocall may make wrong decision. Set g first.
    adjustSignalStack is recursively nosplit, so it is okay that
    temporarily gsignal.stack doesn't match the stack we're running
    on.
    
    May fix #39079.
