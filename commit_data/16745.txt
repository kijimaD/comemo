commit 41fd4f988ce2297ea6d2bf7755e753638a8cf33a

    misc/cgo/test: make test work with -linkmode=internal
    
    The static func named thread in issue5337.go's C snippet
    conflicts with the static func named thread in issue3350.go's C snippet.
    I don't know why (they're both static) but I also don't care,
    because -linkmode=internal only needs to be able to handle
    the cgo in the standard library, and it does.
    
    Change the test to avoid this problem.
    
    Fixes build (after run.bash is fixed to detect the breakage).
