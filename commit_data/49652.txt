    cmd/compile: fix mknode script
    
    It's not currently working. Somehow a field of type []constant.Value
    causes it to barf. (That field was added with jump table statements.)
    
    Also added some instructions about how to run it correctly (which took
    me a suprisingly long time to figure out).
    
    Larger improvements coming, but this gets us to a working state
    and is safe for 1.19.
