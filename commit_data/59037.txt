    archive/zip: reduce memory held by Writer.Copy
    
    Make a copy of the argument File's FileHeader, and pass a pointer
    to the copy to CreateRaw.
    
    Passing the pointer directly causes the entire `File` to be referenced
    by the receiver. The `File` includes a reference to the `ReaderAt`
    underlying the `Reader`, so all its memory, which may be the entire
    contents of the archive, is prevented from being garbage-collected.
    
    Also, explain the issue in the doc comment for CreateRaw. We
    cannot change its behavior because someone may depend on the
    preserving the identity of its argument pointer.
    
    For #65499.
