    Revert "encoding/json: reuse values when decoding map elements"
    
    This reverts golang.org/cl/179337.
    
    Reason for revert: broke a few too many reasonably valid Go programs.
    The previous behavior was perhaps less consistent, but the docs were
    never very clear about when the decoder merges with existing values,
    versus replacing existing values altogether.
    
    Fixes #39149.
