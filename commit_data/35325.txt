    go/types: don't associate methods with alias type names
    
    R=go1.11
    
    The existing code associated methods with receiver base type
    names before knowing if a type name denoted a locally defined
    type. Sometimes, methods would be incorrectly associated with
    alias type names and consequently were lost down the road.
    
    This change first collects all methods with non-blank names
    and in a follow-up pass resolves receiver base type names to
    valid non-alias type names with which the methods are then
    associated.
    
    Fixes #23042.
