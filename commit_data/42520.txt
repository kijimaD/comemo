    cmd/compile: give every really deep type a unique name
    
    This avoids the security problem in #29312 where two very deep, but
    distinct, types are given the same name. They both make it to the
    linker which chooses one, and the use of the other is now type unsafe.
    
    Instead, give every very deep type its own name. This errs on the
    other side, in that very deep types that should be convertible to each
    other might now not be. But at least that's not a security hole.
    
    Update #29312.
