    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: load large constants into vector registers from rodata
    
    Load large constants into vector registers from rodata, instead of placing them
    in the literal pool. This treats VMOVQ/VMOVD/VMOVS the same as FMOVD/FMOVS and
    makes use of the existing mechanism for storing values in rodata. Two additional
    instructions are required for a load, however these instructions are used
    infrequently and already have a high latency.
    
    Updates #59615
