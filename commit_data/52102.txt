    internal/poll: avoid race between SetDeadline and timer expiry in Plan 9
    
    The mutexes added by CL 235820 aren't sufficient to prevent a race when
    an i/o deadline timer fires just as the deadline is being reset to zero.
    
    Consider this possible sequence when goroutine S is clearing the
    deadline and goroutine T has been started by the timer:
    
    1. S locks the mutex
    2. T blocks on the mutex
    3. S sets the timedout flag to false
    4. S calls Stop on the timer (and fails, because the timer has fired)
    5. S unlocks the mutex
    6. T locks the mutex
    7. T sets the timedout flag to true
    
    Now all subsequent I/O will timeout, although the deadline has been
    cleared.
    
    The fix is for the timeout goroutine to skip setting the timedout
    flag if the timer pointer has been cleared, or reassigned by
    another SetDeadline operation.
    
    Fixes #57114
