    encoding/gob: add Encode-Decode Int slices tests
    
    Tinkering with the gob package shows that is currently possible to
    *completely destroy* Int slices encoding without triggering a single
    test failure.
    
    The various encInt{8,16,32,64}Slice methods are only called during the
    execution of the GobMapInterfaceEncode test, which only encodes a few
    slices of length exactly 1 and then just checks that the error
    returned by Encode is nil (without trying to Decode back the data).
    
    This patch adds a few tests for signed integer slices encoding.
