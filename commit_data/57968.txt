    runtime/cgo: report a meaningful error message when using Cygwin
    
    Go has never supported Cygwin as a C compiler, but users get the
    following cryptic error message when they try to use it:
    
        implicit declaration of function '_beginthread'
    
    This is because Cygwin doesn't implement _beginthread. Note that
    this is not the only problem with Cygwin, but it's the one that
    users are most likely to run into first.
    
    This CL improves the error message to make it clear that Cygwin
    is not supported, and suggests using MinGW instead.
    
    Fixes #59490
    Fixes #36691
