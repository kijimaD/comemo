    cmd/go: skip some tests that run builds in short mode
    
    cmd/go tests that run builds are generally skipped in short mode. This
    change will adds skips for some tests that were running builds.
    
    I found these by sorting tests by elapsed time and removing the top
    tests that invoked go build. It's our practice to skip tests that run go
    build without the -n flag (which prints but doesn't execute commands).
    
    On my work laptop this reduces test run time from about 20 seconds to
    about 16 seconds. On my linux workstation it reduces test run time from
    about 10 seconds to about 5 seconds.
