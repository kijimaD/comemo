    mime/multipart: don't strip leading space/tab in quoted-printable decoding
    
    Late bug fix, but this is arguably a regression from Go 1.0,
    since we added this transparent decoding since then. Without
    this fix, Go 1.0 users could decode this correctly, but Go 1.1
    users would not be able to.
    
    The newly added test is from the RFC itself.
    
    The updated tests had the wrong "want" values before. They
    were there to test \r\n vs \n equivalence (which is
    unchanged), not leading whitespace.
    
    The skipWhite decoder struct field was added in the battles of
    Issue 4771 in revision b3bb265bfecf. It was just a wrong
    strategy, from an earlier round of attempts in
    https://golang.org/cl/7300092/
    
    Update #4771
    Fixes #5295
