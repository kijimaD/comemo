    [dev.typealias] spec: use term 'embedded field' rather than 'anonymous field'
    
    First steps towards defining type aliases in the spec.
    This is a nomenclature clarification, not a language change.
    
    The spec used all three terms 'embedded type', 'anonymous field',
    and 'embedded field'. Users where using the terms inconsistently.
    
    The notion of an 'anonymous' field was always misleading since they
    always had a de-facto name. With type aliases that name becomes even
    more important because we may have different names for the same type.
    
    Use the term 'embedded field' consistently and remove competing
    terminology.
    
    For #18130.
