    cmd/link: export specialized variants of runtime._type to debug_info
    
    The reflect package can be used to create new types at runtime, these
    types will have runtime._type entries describing them but no entry in
    debug_info (obviously).
    
    A debugger that wanted to print the value of variables with such types
    will have to read the runtime._type directly, however the
    "specializations" of runtime._type (runtime.slicetype, runtime.maptype,
    etc) are not exported to debug_info, besides runtime.interfacetype.
    
    All those types (i.e. runtime.slicetype, runtime.maptype, etc) should
    be exported to debug_info so that debuggers don't have to hard-code
    their description.
    
    Fixes #19602
