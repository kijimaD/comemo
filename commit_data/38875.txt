    cmd/compile: improve error message for non-final variadic parameter
    
    Previously, when a function signature had defined a non-final variadic
    parameter, the error message always referred to the type associated with that
    parameter. However, if the offending parameter's name was part of an identifier
    list with a variadic type, one could misinterpret the message, thinking the
    problem had been with one of the other names in the identifer list.
    
        func bar(a, b ...int) {}
    clear ~~~~~~~^       ^~~~~~~~ confusing
    
    This change updates the error message and sets the column position to that of
    the offending parameter's name, if it exists.
    
    Fixes #28450.
