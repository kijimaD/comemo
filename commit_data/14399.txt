    net/http: add missing error checking reading trailers
    
    This is a simplified version of earlier versions of this CL
    and now only fixes obviously incorrect things, without
    changing the locking on bodyEOFReader.
    
    I'd like to see if this is sufficient before changing the
    locking.
    
    Update #4191
