    encoding/json: address go vet reports
    
    The error message for decoding a unquoted value into a struct field with
    the ,string option specified has two arguments when one is needed.
    Make the error message take one argument and add a test in order to cover
    the case when a unquoted value is specified.
    
    Also add error value as the missing argument for Fatalf call in test.
    
    Fixes the following go vet reports:
    
    decode.go:602: wrong number of args for format in Errorf call: 1 needed but 2 args
    decode_test.go:1088: missing argument for Fatalf("%v"): format reads arg 1, have only 0 args
