    math/big: remove "else" from if with block that ends with return
    
    That "else" was needed due to gc DCE limitations.
    Now it's not the case and we can avoid go lint complaints.
    (See #23521 and https://golang.org/cl/91056.)
    
    There is inlining test for bigEndianWord, so if test
    is passing, no performance regression should occur.
