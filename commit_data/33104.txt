    doc: soften the NetBSD warning now that a unverified fix is being released
    
    To-be-released NetBSD 7.1.1 reportedly fixes the kernel panic that was
    affecting our builders and is being released because of Go's warning.
    
    So, soften our warning.
    
    7.1.1 might work, but I can't get a builder up and running to verify
    yet as it appears that Anita either doesn't support it yet, or the
    NetBSD CDN doesn't have the files yet.
