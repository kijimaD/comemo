commit 2cbeb1dbb18050ea33a9b8553eb7f71636afa7fd
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 24 14:04:43 2009 -0800

    change the rules for maintaining AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS files.
    the current system is too painful, so instead let's just have the coders tell us the details.
    we can update the files ourselves.
