    math/big: add 0 shift fastpath to shl and shr
    
    One could expect calls like
    
      z.mant.shl(z.mant, shiftAmount)
    
    (or higher-level-functions calls that use lhs/rhs) to be almost free
    when shiftAmount = 0; and expect calls like
    
      z.mant.shl(x.mant, 0)
    
    to have the same cost of a x.mant -> z.mant copy. Neither of this
    things are currently true.
    
    For an 800 words nat, the first kind of calls cost ~800ns for rigth
    shifts and ~3.5µs for left shift; while the second kind of calls are
    doing more work than necessary by calling shlVU/shrVU.
    
    This change makes the first kind of calls ({Shl,Shr}Same) almost free,
    and the second kind of calls ({Shl,Shr}) about 30% faster.
    
    name                  old time/op  new time/op  delta
    ZeroShifts/Shl-4      3.64µs ± 3%  2.49µs ± 1%  -31.55%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    ZeroShifts/ShlSame-4  3.65µs ± 1%  0.01µs ± 1%  -99.85%  (p=0.000 n=9+9)
    ZeroShifts/Shr-4      3.65µs ± 1%  2.49µs ± 1%  -31.91%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    ZeroShifts/ShrSame-4   825ns ± 0%     6ns ± 1%  -99.33%  (p=0.000 n=9+10)
    
    During go test math/big, the shl zeroshift fastpath is triggered 1380
    times; while the shr fastpath is triggered 153334 times(!).
