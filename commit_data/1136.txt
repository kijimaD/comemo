commit 5aa7dc5daf821d1bdacde2fe23523a5406c70e8e
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    adopt suggestions from Bentley and McIlroy (SP&E Nov 1993)
    to make qsort more robust:
    
            * use "ninther" to choose pivot.
            * use three-way partition to avoid quadratic
              behavior on all-one-value arrays.
    
    also add tests suggested in that paper.
    
    the immediate cause of the slowness we observed was
    in fact none of these: the recursive call was sorting
    data[0:m] instead of data[a:m].
    
    also rename package to "sort" to match convention.
