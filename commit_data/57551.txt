    go/types, types2: remove dependency on Scope.Contains in resolver
    
    In extremely rare cases of receiver base types of the form
    C.foo where C refers to an `import "C"`, we needed Scope.Contains
    to lookup the file scope containing the "C" import.
    Replace the position-dependent Scope.Contains with an explicit
    scope search that doesn't require a position.
    
    Also, make the surrounding code match more closely between
    go/types and types2.
