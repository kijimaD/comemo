    cmd/go: use os.UserCacheDir for the default GOCACHE
    
    This piece of code predates the addition of os.UserCacheDir, and it
    looks like os.UserCacheDir was based on this piece of code.
    
    The two behaved exactly the same, minus cmd/go's addition of AppData for
    Windows XP in CL 87675. However, Go 1.11 dropped support for Windows XP,
    so we can safely ignore that change now.
    
    The only tweaks necessary are to return "off" if an error is
    encountered, and to disable warnings if we're using "/.cache".
