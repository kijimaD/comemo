    test: relax fixedbugs/issue20250.go expectations
    
    With GOEXPERIMENT=unified, the order variables are printed in "live at
    entry to f.func1" is sensitive to whether regabi is enabled for some
    reason. The order shouldn't matter to correctness, but it is odd.
    
    For now, this CL just relaxes the test expectation order to unblock
    enabling GOEXPERIMENT=unified by default. I've filed #54402 to
    investigate further to confirm this a concern.
    
    Updates #54402.
