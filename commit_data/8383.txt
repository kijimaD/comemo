    misc/vim: new Vim indentation script.
    
    This uses a fully custom function for indenting Go code in Vim.
    It provides a lot more flexibility than a cindent-based approach,
    so this version gets the := operator correct, as well as switch
    labels and jump labels.
    
    One outstanding TODO is to handle lines immediately after jump labels.
