    [dev.link] cmd/link: allow either of duplicated symbols being dupok
    
    If two symbols have the same name, the old code allows either one
    being dupok (preferably both, but either is ok). Currently, the
    new code only works when the new symbol being dupok (or both).
    Allow only old symbol being dupok as well.
    
    One example for this is the tls_g variable on ARM64 and PPC64
    when the race detector is enabled.
    
    Should fix Linux/ARM64 build.
