    testing: only call flag.Parse if it has not been called before
    
    Calling flag.Parse twice can be problematic if other goroutines called
    flag.Parsed in between: the race detector complains due to the
    write after read from a different goroutine.
    
    This can happen if TestMain calls flag.Parse and launches goroutines
    that call flag.Parsed, for example if it initializes a server which
    checks flags.
    
    This patch makes testing.M.Run only parse the flags if they have not
    been parsed already.
