    net: increase maximum accepted DNS packet to 1232 bytes
    
    The existing value of 512 bytes as is specified by RFC 1035.
    However, the WSL resolver reportedly sends larger packets without
    setting the truncation bit, which breaks using the Go resolver.
    For 1.18 and backports, just increase the accepted packet size.
    This is what GNU glibc does (they use 65536 bytes).
    
    For 1.19 we plan to use EDNS to set the accepted packet size.
    That will give us more time to test whether that causes any problems.
    
    No test because I'm not sure how to write one and it wouldn't really
    be useful anyhow.
    
    Fixes #6464
    Fixes #21160
    Fixes #44135
    Fixes #51127
    For #51153
