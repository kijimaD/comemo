    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: rewrite parsing of TEXT $3-2
    
    It was too complicated, assuming the syntax is more general than reality.
    It must be a possibly negative integer followed by an optional minus sign
    and positive integer. Literals only, no expresssions.
    
    Also put in a TODO about address parsing and clean up a couple of types.
