    cmd/9a: fix GLOBL instruction
    
    Because it was lumped in with the TEXT instruction,
    the high 32 bits of the 64-bit constant holding the size
    were always set to 0x80000000 (ArgsSizeUnknown).
    This only worked because cmd/9l was reading the 64-bit
    value into an int32.
    
    While we're here, fix 5a.
    It wasn't as much of a problem there because
    the two values were being stored in two different fields.
    But it was still wrong.
