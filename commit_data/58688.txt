    cmd/go/internal/modload: don't set GIT_SSH_COMMAND
    
    Allows git core.sshcommand to take effect when set by the user.
    This was originally added to work around an issue in
    OpenSSH < 7.3 (2016), see https://go.dev/issue/13453 .
    A fixed version of OpenSSH should be widely available enough
    that it is no longer necessary
    
    Fixes #71482
