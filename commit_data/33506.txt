    [release-branch.go1.9] testing: don't fail all tests after racy test failure
    
    The code was adding race.Errors to t.raceErrors before checking
    Failed, but Failed was using t.raceErrors+race.Errors. We don't want
    to change Failed, since that would affect tests themselves, so modify
    the harness to not unnecessarily change t.raceErrors.
    
    Updates #19851
    Fixes #21338
