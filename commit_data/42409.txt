    spec: reword claim about the grammar being regular
    
    Since the word "regular" has a precise meaning in the context of
    formal languages, the Introduction sentence claiming that Go's grammar
    is "compact and regular" may mislead readers.
    
    Reword it using Rob's suggestion.
    
    Fixes #36037
