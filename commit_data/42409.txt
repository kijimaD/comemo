    os: in Symlink, stat the correct target path for drive-relative targets on Windows
    
    Previously, when the target (“old”) path passed to os.Symlink was a
    “root-relative” Windows path,¹ we would erroneously prepend
    destination (“new”) path when determining which path to Stat,
    resulting in an invalid path which was then masked by the lack of
    error propagation for the Stat call (#39183).
    
    If the link target is a directory (rather than a file), that would
    result in the symlink being created without the
    SYMBOLIC_LINK_FLAG_DIRECTORY flag, which then fails in os.Open.
