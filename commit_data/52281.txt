    go/format: skip go/ast's object resolution
    
    Just like https://golang.org/cl/401454 removed the work from gofmt for a
    nice ~5% speed-up in the default case, we can also use the option in the
    equivalent go/format for programs which use it rather than gofmt,
    as go/format makes no use of objects either.
    
    No benchmark numbers as we already measured the ~5% speed-up with gofmt
    in the other CL linked above.
    
    See #46485.
