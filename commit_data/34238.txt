    net/http: increase timeout length for TestOnlyWriteTimeout
    
    This test was sometimes timing out on the plan9/arm builder
    (raspberry pi) when run in parallel with other network intensive
    tests. It appears that tcp on the loopback interface could do
    with some tuning for better performance on Plan 9, but until
    that's done, increasing the timeout from 5 to 10 seconds allows
    this test to pass.  This should have no effect on other platforms
    where 5 seconds was already enough.
