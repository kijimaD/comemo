    runtime: add GODEBUG=gccheckmark=0/1
    
    Previously, gccheckmark could only be enabled or disabled by calling
    runtime.GCcheckmarkenable/GCcheckmarkdisable.  This was a necessary
    hack because GODEBUG was broken.
    
    Now that GODEBUG works again, move control over gccheckmark to a
    GODEBUG variable and remove these runtime functions.  Currently,
    gccheckmark is enabled by default (and will probably remain so for
    much of the 1.5 development cycle).
