    cmd/vet: fix some pointer false positives in printf
    
    fmt's godoc reads:
    
            For compound objects, the elements are printed using these
            rules, recursively, laid out like this:
    
                    struct:             {field0 field1 ...}
                    array, slice:       [elem0 elem1 ...]
                    maps:               map[key1:value1 key2:value2 ...]
                    pointer to above:   &{}, &[], &map[]
    
    That is, a pointer to a struct, array, slice, or map, can be correctly
    printed by fmt if the type pointed to can be printed without issues.
    
    vet was only following this rule for pointers to structs, omitting
    arrays, slices, and maps. Fix that, and add tests for all the
    combinations.
    
    Updates #27672.
