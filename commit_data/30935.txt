    runtime: diagram flow of stats through heap profile
    
    Every time I modify heap profiling, I find myself redrawing this
    diagram, so add it to the comments. This shows how allocations and
    frees are accounted, how we arrive at consistent profile snapshots,
    and when those snapshots are published to the user.
