    cmd/go: ensure external test files are presented to the linker first
    
    Fixes #7627.
    
    CL 61970044 changed the order in which .a files are passed to gccgo's link phase. However by reversing the order it caused gccgo to complain if both internal (liba.a) and external (liba_test.a) versions of a package were presented as the former would not contain all the necessary symbols, and the latter would duplicate symbols already defined.
    
    This change ensures that all 'fake' targets remain at the top of the final link order which should be fine as a package compiled as an external test is a superset of its internal sibling.
    
    Looking at how gcToolchain links tests I think this change now accurately mirrors those actions which present $WORK/_test before $WORK in the link order.
