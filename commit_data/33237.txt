    net/http: set Content-Type header in Redirect
    
    Setting the Content-Type header explicitly allows browsers to know what
    the type of the content is. Otherwise, they have to guess the type from
    the content itself, which could lead to unpredictable behavior, and
    increases CPU usage.
    
    Not setting the Content-Type despite writing a body may also trigger
    unwanted warnings in user middleware, and make it more difficult to
    resolve valid issues where the user forgets to set Content-Type in
    some situations where it should be set.
    
    There is some precedent for doing this in http.FileServer, which
    sets "Content-Type" to "text/html; charset=utf-8" before writing
    <pre><a href=...></a></pre> HTML.
