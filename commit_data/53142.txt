    [dev.unified] test: relax panic message expectations
    
    In this test, traditionally the comparison `*l == r[0]` was left as a
    comparison between `*l` (type `any`) and `r[0]` (type `*int`), and the
    rest of the compiler needed to handle mixed-typed comparisons.
    However, this means more complexity for wiring up explicit rtypes.
    
    To simplify rtype handling, the next CL will change unified IR to
    instead handle the expression as `*l == any(r[0])`. However, a
    consequence of this currently is that walk will now sequence the
    `any(r[0])` expression first, because it involves a
    concrete-to-interface conversion. And in turn, this means the `r[0]`
    panic ("index out of bounds") will take priority over the `*l`
    panic ("nil pointer dereference").
    
    This is a change in user-visible semantics in some cases, but the Go
    spec leaves this unspecified, so it shouldn't be an issue. Note also:
    gccgo has the same behavior (i.e., panicking on index out of bounds,
    not nil pointer dereference), and cmd/compile also already has the
    same behavior when the interface conversion is explicit (as in the
    added "nil pointer dereference #3" test case).
    
    Updates #23735.
    Updates #32187.
