    crypto/tls: fix testHandshake close flakes
    
    The flakes were introduced by me in CL 586655. It's unclear why only
    FreeBSD seems affected, maybe other TCP stacks handle sending on a
    half-closed connection differently, or aren't as quick to propagate the
    RST over localhost.
    
    Fixes #68155
