    crypto/internal/fips140/aes: actually use the VTBL instruction on arm64
    
    Support for the VTBL instruction was added in CL 110015 - use it
    directly, rather than using WORD encodings. Note that one of the
    WORD encodings does not actually match the instruction in the
    comment - use the instruction that matches the existing encoding
    instead.
