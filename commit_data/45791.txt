    runtime: give test child time to block
    
    The child in TestPanicSystemstack prints "x\n" and then blocks on a
    lock. Receiving those bytes only indicates that the child is _about to
    block_. Since we don't have a way to know when it is fully blocked,
    sleep a bit to give it time to block. This makes us less likely to lose
    the race and signal before the child blocks, which will fail the test as
    the stack trace cannot be read from a running G.
    
    Fixes #33626
