    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: double speed of CSE phase
    
    Replaced comparison based on (*Type).String() with an
    allocation-free structural comparison.  Roughly doubles
    speed of CSE, also reduces allocations.
    
    Checked that roughly the same number of CSEs were detected
    during make.bash (about a million) and that "new" CSEs
    were caused by the effect described above.
