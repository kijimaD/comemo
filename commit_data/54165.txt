    cmd/compile/internal/types: simpler signature type representation
    
    Now that all of the uses of signature types have been cleaned up, we
    can simplify the internal representation significantly.
    
    In particular, instead of 3 separate struct objects each with 3
    separate slices of fields, we can store all of the parameters in a
    single slice and track the boundaries between them.
    
    We still need a results tuple struct for representing the type of
    multi-value call expressions, but just a single one and it can safely
    reuse the results subsection of the full parameters slice.
    
    Note: while Sizeof(Func) has increased (e.g., 32->56 on amd64), we're
    saving on the allocation of 2 Types, 2 Structs, and 2 []*Field (288
    bytes total on amd64), not counting any extra GC size class padding
    from using a single shared []*Field instead of 3 separate ones.
