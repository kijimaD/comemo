    cmd/compile: use named fields in nodl
    
    We use a struct to allocate two structs simultaneously.
    Because we embed structs rather than using named fields,
    the compiler generates forwarding method stubs for the
    anonymous type.
    
    In theory, the compiler could detect that these stubs are unnecessary:
    The value in question has a very limited scope, the methods are not
    called, and there are operations where an interface would need
    to be satisfied.
    
    This compiler optimization is unlikely to happen, though;
    the ROI is likely to be low.
    
    Instead, just give the fields names. Cuts 64k off the cmd/compile binary.
