    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of stdlib_test.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/stdlib_test.go
    and stdlib_test.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker, using the os package
    instead of ioutil, and some comment adjustments. Also, bug251.go passes
    because of recent changes.
    
    The primary difference is in the firstComment function which
    doesn't have access to a scanner and instead uses the syntax
    package's CommentsDu function.
