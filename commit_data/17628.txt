commit 00061219f03d666e93947a3cb326256062a7a92c

    cmd/nm: make -S listing a bit more accurate
    
    Hide container symbols like text and etext so that
    the individual pieces inside are shown instead.
    For example, if text and main.init have the same
    address, it was a toss-up which name was printed.
