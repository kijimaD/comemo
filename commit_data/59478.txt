    internal/pkgbits: write a formal grammar for UIR primitives
    
    This complements the grammar being developed in package noder. It
    is unclear how to discuss references in their current state, as
    they require knowledge of sections, elements, etc.
    
    Perhaps the references here should refer to indices on the byte
    array. This would allow a stronger separation of pkgbits and noder.
