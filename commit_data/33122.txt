    cmd/dist: don't run moved_goroot test on android, iOS, Plan 9
    
    Fails on iOS because CC_FOR_TARGET points to clangwrap.sh in the
    original GOROOT. We could fix that but it doesn't seem worth it.
    
    Fails on Android with "exec format error". I'm not sure why but I
    doubt it is interesting.
    
    Fails on Plan 9 because the original GOROOT is being preserved in some
    unknown way. This is issue #21016.
    
    Updates #21016
