    undo CL 13632053 / dc7bfe0f022d
    
    It was never going to last.
    
    ««« original CL description
    cmd/api: break the builds
    
    There is some question about whether the api tool is
    running on Windows (see issue 6124), and now I'm
    starting to question whether it runs on any of the builders,
    since both darwin/amd64 and linux/amd64 are crashing for me
    in the api tool due to a recent cgo-related change, and yet
    the dashboard is happy.
    
    If the dashboard is still happy after this CL, we have a problem.
    
    Update #6124
