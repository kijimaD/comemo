    runtime: only trace mark assists that do work
    
    Currently we trace mark assists even if they're satisfied entirely by
    stealing. This means even if background marking is keeping up with
    allocation, we'll still emit a trace event every N bytes of
    allocation. The event will be a few microseconds, if that, but they're
    frequent enough that, when zoomed out in the trace view, it looks like
    all of the time is spent in mark assists even if almost none is.
    
    Change this so we only emit a trace event if the assist actually has
    to do assisting. This makes the traces of these events far more
    useful.
