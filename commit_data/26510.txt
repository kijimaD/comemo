    cmd/go: avoid a few symlink-induced errors in internal and vendor checks
    
    This CL expands symlinks only when an error would be reported otherwise.
    Since the expansions are only on error paths, anything that worked yesterday
    should still work after this CL.
    
    This CL fixes a regression from Go 1.5 in "go run", or else we'd probably
    postpone it.
    
    Changing only the error paths is meant as a way to reduce the risk of
    making this change so late in the release cycle, but it may actually be
    the right strategy for symlinks in general.
    
    Fixes #14054.
