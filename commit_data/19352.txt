commit 61d8a33719e0a90f74adb432cdfd3ab3d261d1d5
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Wed May 14 11:47:19 2014 -0700

    spec: more precise description of select statement
    
    - use previously defined terms (with links) throughout
    - specify evaluation order more precisely (in particular,
      the evaluation time of rhs expressions in receive cases
      was not specified)
    - added extra example case
    
    Not a language change.
    
    Description matches observed behavior of code compiled
    with gc and gccgo.
    
    Fixes #7669.
