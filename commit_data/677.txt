commit a1ee6804dd9282fa00bcbc9692a221d67ddbdafe
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    - fixed bug which prevented parser.go from compiling
      (typo in ptr decl lead to an unresolved forward declaration)
    - fixed parser bugs
    - fixed Makefile
    - now successfully parses most code
    
    Issues:
    - composite literals (cannot be identified easily from syntax alone)
    - new(T, ...) (cannot be identified easily from syntax alone since
      new is not a keyword and thus could be a different function then
      the allocation function at which point "new((x + y))" is legal,
      but the inner "(x" looks like the beginning of a function type)
