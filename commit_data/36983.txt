    cmd/go: document convention to signify generated code.
    
    This change updates the go tool's documentation under the section
    "Generate Go files by processing source" to mention the convention that
    generated source files should have a line of text that matches the
    following regular expression:
    
        ^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\.$
    
    Previously, the canonical documentation for this convention
    (https://golang.org/s/generatedcode) referenced Rob Pike's comment at
    https://golang.org/issue/13560#issuecomment-288457920. This change
    merely moves that information to a more visible place.
    
    Updates #25433.
