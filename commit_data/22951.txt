    misc/ios: fix teamID and appID use in entitlements
    
    This is a follow-up to CL 8910.
    This is the version that I have tested and which works
    when appID and teamID are not the same (which they appear
    to be for the builder).
    
    I am unsure how I submitted it with the wrong code.
