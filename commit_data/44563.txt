    doc/go1.16: start draft release notes
    
    This template is based on CL 220278 and previous ones like it.
    Include Compiler and Linker sections proactively, they can be
    removed if they don't end up being needed for Go 1.16.
    
    Use two spaces of indentation for TODOs to set a better precedent
    for the final text that will take its place.
    
    'relnote -html' does not report any changes at this time.
    
    For #40700.
