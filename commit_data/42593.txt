    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: restore the ADDI instruction in jalrToSym
    
    While this instruction is not needed for the relocation (the lower immediate
    can be patched directly into the JALR instruction), other code currently
    depends on the jump sequence being 12 bytes (or three instructions) long.
    Put the ADDI instruction back until these can be found and fixed.
    
    Updates #27532
