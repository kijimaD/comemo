    cmd/go/internal/modcmd: eliminate a call to modload.LoadedModules
    
    modload.LoadedModules reveals more information than necessary about
    whether modules have been loaded lazily. The 'vendor' subcommand
    doesn't actually need that much information: it has all of the
    information that it needs from prior calls to LoadPackages and
    ModFile.
    
    For #36460
