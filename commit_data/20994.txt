    net/http/httputil: don't use DisableKeepAlives in DumpRequestOut, fix build
    
    I broke the build in https://golang.org/change/207950a when I made
    http.Transport send "Connection: close" request headers when
    DisableKeepAlives was set true because I didn't run all the tests
    before submitting.
    
    httputil.DumpRequestOut used Transport to get its output, and used it
    with DisableKeepAlives, so this changed the output.
    
    Rather than updating golden data in our tests (because surely others
    depend on the exact bytes from these in their tests), switch to not
    using DisableKeepAlives in DumpRequestOut instead, so the output is
    the same as before.
