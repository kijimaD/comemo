    runtime: fix saved PC/SP after safe-point function in syscall
    
    Running a safe-point function on syscall entry uses systemstack() and
    hence clobbers g.sched.pc and g.sched.sp. Fix this by re-saving them
    after the systemstack, just like in the other uses of systemstack in
    reentersyscall.
