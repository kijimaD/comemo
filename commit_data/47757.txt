    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: add stub for coverage
    
    This change only includes a stub for the function
    which will hook into the runtime to expose
    coverage instrumentation while we're fuzzing.
    
    Previously, we discussed an exported API named
    FuzzCoverage, but since this is within the
    internal/fuzz package, simply naming it coverage
    seems appropriate.
