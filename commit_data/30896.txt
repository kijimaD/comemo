    cmd/compile: fix names of inlined methods from other packages
    
    Previously, an inlined call to wg.Done() in package main would have the
    following incorrect symbol name:
    
        main.(*sync.WaitGroup).Done
    
    This change modifies methodname to return the correct symbol name:
    
        sync.(*WaitGroup).Done
    
    This fix was suggested by @mdempsky.
    
    Fixes #19467.
