    runtime: initial windows/arm64 implementation files
    
    This CL adds a few small files - defs, os, and rt0 - to start
    on windows/arm64 support for the runtime.
    
    It also copies sys_windows_arm.s to sys_windows_arm64.s,
    with the addition of "#ifdef NOT_PORTED" around the entire file.
    This is meant to make future CLs easier to review, since the
    general pattern is to translate the 32-bit ARM assembly into
    64-bit ARM assembly.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
