    cmd/go/internal/mvs: indicate the actual version when printing a mismatched ModuleError
    
    Previously, we suppressed the module version annotation if the last
    error in the stack was a *module.ModuleError, regardless of its path.
    However, if the error is for a replacement module, that produces a
    confusing error message: the error is attributed to the last module in
    the error path, but actually originates in the replacement (which is
    not otherwise indicated).
    
    Now, we print both the original and the replacement modules when they
    differ, which may add some unfortunate redundancy in the output but at
    least doesn't drop the very relevant information about replacements.
    
    Fixes #35039
