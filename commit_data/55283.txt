    go/types, types2: avoid confusing error message "have m(T), want m(T)"
    
    This is a partial fix for situations where a method lookup leads to
    an error due to non-matching signatures, but where the signatures
    print exactly the same. This can happen if both signatures contain
    type parameters (after instantiation) and the type parameters have
    the same name (such as "T").
    
    For now, rather than printing a confusing error message in this
    case, leave away the confusing part of the error message (at the
    cost of providing slightly less information).
    
    In the long run, we need to find a better solution for this problem;
    but this seems better than what we had before.
    
    For #61685.
