    [dev.link] cmd/link: fix ppc64-specific bug in genelfsym
    
    The code in the the linker's genelfsym() routine was not properly
    including runtime.text.%d marker symbols that are emitted on PPC64
    when a very large text section is split into chunks. This bug was
    introduced in CL 233338 when portions of asmb2() were converted
    from sym.Symbol to loader.Sym usage.
