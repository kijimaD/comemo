    crypto/elliptic: remove deprecation markers
    
    These should be deprecated, but per go.dev/wiki/Deprecated,
    that should only happen two releases after the replacement is
    available (so Go 1.22).
    
    The deprecation of this package was part of the discussion
    of proposal #52221. All that remains is waiting for the new
    package to be widely available.
