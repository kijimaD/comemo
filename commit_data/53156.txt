    net/http: remove accidental heading in Head documentation
    
    This short sentence was missing a period at the end, which caused it
    to be interpreted as a heading. It also gained a '# ' prefix as part
    of new gofmt formatting applied in CL 384268. This change makes it a
    regular sentence as originally intended.
    
    Updates #51082.
