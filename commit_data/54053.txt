    go/internal/gcimporter: fix ureader.go handling of local defined types
    
    In unified IR, local defined types are promoted to a global defined
    type with a "vargen" suffix. These shouldn't actually be exposed to
    go/types users, because they're only relevant within function bodies,
    which go/types doesn't support importing.
    
    Moreover, in the case of defined types that were declared within a
    generic function, they can have ambient type parameters, which the
    go/types importer doesn't know how to handle (because they shouldn't
    be needed for that use case).
    
    While here, prune the gcimporter_test.go skip list, because some of
    the listed failures have actually been fixed and all of them are
    specific to the Go 1.18 (nounified) frontend. They all work correctly
    with GOEXPERIMENT=unified.
    
    Fixes #55110.
