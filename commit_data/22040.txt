    [dev.cc] cmd/gc: tweak default fatal in ordersafeexpr for c2go
    
    c2go was putting a fallthrough after the fatal call.
    Changed c2go to know that fatal doesn't return,
    but then there is a missing return at the end of
    the translated Go function.
    Move code around a little to make C and Go agree.
