    cmd/compile: emit DWARF call_line attrs with data4 form on iOS
    
    When targeting iOS, change the format (DWARF "form") of the call line
    attribute for inlined subroutine DIEs, to work around an apparent bug
    in /usr/bin/symbols on Darwin.
    
    [Just for posterity: there is nothing wrong with using DW_FORM_udata
    for the call_line attribute form; this is perfectly legal DWARF (and
    is in fact recommended by the standard relative to data4, which is
    less descriptive and often takes more space). The form switch is there
    just to make the Apple tools happy.]
    
    Updates #31459.
