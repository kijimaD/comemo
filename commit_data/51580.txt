    cmd/go/internal/modfetch: avoid leaking a lockedfile.File in case of write errors
    
    The go modules download command has a method called hashZip which checks the
    hash of a zipped directory versus an expected value, and then writes it out
    to a file. In the event that the write operation is not successful, we do
    not close the file, leading to it being leaked. This could happen if the
    user runs out of disk space, causing the underlying OS write command to
    return an error. Ultimately, this led to a panic in lockfile.OpenFile which
    was invoked from a finalizer garbage collecting the leaked file. The result
    was a stack trace that didn't show the call stack from where the write
    operation actually failed.
    
    Fixes #50858
