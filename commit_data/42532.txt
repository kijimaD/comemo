    [dev.link] cmd/link: add support for setting symbol File property
    
    Add loader methods to get/set the "file" symbol property.
    
    In the legacy sym.Symbol struct, there is both a 'unit' field
    (pointing to a CompilationUnit with package path, etc) and a 'file'
    field. In the case of compiler-generated Go symbols, 'file' is
    redundant (stores the package again), however for symbols read out of
    a shared library (in the -linkshared case) it is important to be able
    to record the file for a symbol.
    
    With the loader, add a side table that can be used to store a file for
    a symbol, and add methods for getting/setting file.
