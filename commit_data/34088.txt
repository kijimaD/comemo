    go/types: use consistent receiver names
    
    Inconsistent names are quite obvious on the godoc HTML rendering:
    
            type Array
                func NewArray(elem Type, len int64) *Array
                func (a *Array) Elem() Type
                func (a *Array) Len() int64
                func (t *Array) String() string
                func (t *Array) Underlying() Type
    
    Fix all the String and Underlying methods to be consistent with their
    types. This makes these two lists of methods less consistent, but that's
    not visible to the user.
    
    This also makes the inconsistent receiver names rule in golint happy.
