    cmd/ld: give acid a fighting chance at unwinding the stack
    
    Acid can't produce a stack trace without .frame symbols.
    
    Of course, it can only unwind through linear stacks but
    this is still better than nothing. (I wrote an acid func
    to do the full unwind a long time ago but lost it and
    haven't worked up the courage to write it again).
    
    Note that these will only be present in the native symbol
    table for Plan 9 binaries.
