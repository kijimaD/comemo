    cmd/cgo: mark C result as written for msan
    
    Otherwise it is possible that msan will consider the C result to be
    partially initialized, which may cause msan to think that the Go stack
    is partially uninitialized. The compiler will never mark the stack as
    initialized, so without this CL it is possible for stack addresses to
    be passed to msanread, which will cause a false positive error from msan.
    
    Fixes #26209
