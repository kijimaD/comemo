    spec: clarify that identical structs must have identical field embeddings
    
    The existing prose for struct identity did only require that two structs
    "have the same sequence of fields, and if corresponding fields have the
    same names, and identical types, and identical tags" for the structs to
    be identical.
    
    The implementation (forever) has also required that two corresponding
    fields are either both embedded or not embedded. This is arguably part
    of a struct's structure but is not explicitly specified.
    
    This CL makes a minor change to the prose to address that.
    
    Fixes #69472.
