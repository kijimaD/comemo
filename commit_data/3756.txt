commit 506ce11f0388064bb91c984fdcf800874abb7651
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 4 03:15:24 2009 -0800

    various tweaks to code review.
    main one is to check at submit time that
    user name being used in checkin message
    is listed in the CONTRIBUTORS file.
    this should catch misconfigurations.
    
    another is to cut the @domain part
    from the R= and CC= lines on checkin
    messages, so that cc'ing someone on
    a change does not mean their email
    address is recorded for all time.
    
    R=r
    CC=go-dev
