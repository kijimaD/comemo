    encoding/asn1: don't parse invalid UTF-8.
    
    Invalid UTF-8 triggers an error when marshaling but, previously, not
    when unmarshaling. This means that ASN.1 structures were not
    round-tripping.
    
    This change makes invalid UTF-8 in a string marked as UTF-8 to be an
    error when Unmarshaling.
    
    Fixes #11126.
