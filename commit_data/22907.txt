    runtime: fix freed page accounting in mHeap_ReclaimList
    
    mHeap_ReclaimList is asked to reclaim at least npages pages, but it
    counts the number of spans reclaimed, not the number of pages
    reclaimed. The number of spans reclaimed is strictly larger than the
    number of pages, so this is not strictly wrong, but it is forcing more
    reclamation than was intended by the caller, which delays large
    allocations.
    
    Fix this by increasing the count by the number of pages in the swept
    span, rather than just increasing it by 1.
    
    Fixes #9048.
