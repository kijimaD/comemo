    runtime: warn about SELinux based mmap failures on Linux.
    
    SELinux will cause mmap to fail when we request w+x memory unless the
    user has configured their policies. We have a warning in make.bash,
    but it's quite likely that the policy will be reset at some point and
    then all their binaries start failing.
    
    This patch prints a warning on Linux when mmap fails with EACCES.
