    runtime: rename GODEBUG=profileruntimelocks to runtimecontentionstacks
    
    profileruntimelocks is new in CL 544195, but the name is deceptive. Even
    with profileruntimelocks=0, runtime-internal locks are still profiled.
    The actual difference is that call stacks are not collected. Instead all
    contention is reported at runtime._LostContendedLock.
    
    Rename this setting to runtimecontentionstacks to make its name more
    aligned with its behavior.
    
    In addition, for this release the default is profileruntimelocks=0,
    meaning that users are fairly likely to encounter
    runtime._LostContendedLock. Rename it to
    runtime._LostContendedRuntimeLock in an attempt to make it more
    intuitive that these are runtime locks, not locks in application code.
    
    For #57071.
