    syscall: test Gettimeofday everywhere, not just on Darwin
    
    The Darwin-only restriction was because we were late in the Go 1.7
    cycle when the test was added.
    
    In the process, I noticed Gettimeofday wasn't in the "unimplemented
    midden heap" section of syscall_nacl.go, despite this line in the
    original go1.txt:
    
    pkg syscall, func Gettimeofday(*Timeval) error
    
    So, add it, returning ENOSYS like the others.
