    strings: add Replacer, NewReplacer
    
    This is just a new API to do many replacements at once.
    
    While the point of this API is to be faster than doing replacements one
    at a time, the implementation in this CL has the optimizations removed
    and may actually be slower.
    
    Future CLs will bring back & add optimizations.
