    runtime: disable gcMarkRootCheck debugging check during STW
    
    gcMarkRootCheck takes ~10ns per goroutine. This is just a debugging
    check, so disable it (plus, if something is going to go wrong, it's
    more likely to go wrong during concurrent mark).
    
    We may be able to re-enable this later, or move it to after we've
    started the world again. (But not for 1.6.x.)
    
    For 1.6.x.
    
    Fixes #14419.
