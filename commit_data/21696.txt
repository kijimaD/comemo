    runtime: set minimum heap size to 4Mbytes
    
    Set the minimum heap size to 4Mbytes except when the hash
    table code wants to force a GC. In an unrelated change when a
    mutator is asked to assist the GC by marking pointer workbufs
    it will keep working until the requested number of pointers
    are processed even if it means asking for additional workbufs.
