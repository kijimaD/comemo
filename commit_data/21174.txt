    misc/cgo: disable TestAllocateFromC in wbshadow mode
    
    This test is doing pointer graph manipulation from C, and we
    cannot support that with concurrent GC. The wbshadow mode
    correctly diagnoses missing write barriers.
    
    Disable the test in that mode for now. There is a bigger issue
    behind it, namely SWIG, but for now we are focused on making
    all.bash pass with wbshadow enabled.
