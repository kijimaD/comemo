    cmd/compile: do not emit a few more basic types from every compilation
    
    We already emit types for any and func(error) string in runtime.a
    but unlike the other pre-emitted types, we don't then exclude them
    from being emitted in other packages. Fix that.
    
    Also add slices of non-func types that we already emit.
    
    Saves 0.3% of .a files in std cmd deps, computed by adding sizes from:
    
            ls -l $(go list -export -f '{{.Export}}' -deps std cmd
    
    The effect is small and not worth doing on its own.
    The real improvement is making “what to write always in runtime”
    and “what not to write in other packages” more obviously aligned.
