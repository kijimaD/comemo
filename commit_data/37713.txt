    math/big: optimize multiplication by 2 and 1/2 in float Sqrt
    
    The Sqrt code previously used explicit constants for 2 and 1/2.  This change
    replaces multiplication by these constants with increment and decrement of
    the floating point exponent directly.  This improves performance by ~7-10%
    for small inputs and minimal improvement for large inputs.
