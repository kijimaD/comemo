commit 3e94e757eff3bfa4150b1e88fda8db98905290de
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 8 14:33:07 2011 -0800

    text/template: make redefinition of a template in a set more consistent.
    Also make it agree with the documentation. You get an error, unless you're
    calling Add explicitly, in which case it panics since that's almost certainly
    a bug. The discrepancy was caused by a panic that wasn't turned into
    an error along one path; deleted the offending function for clarity.
