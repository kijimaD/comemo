    cmd/5l,6l,8l: remove bogus dynsym section indexes
    
    Previously, this code generated bogus section indexes for dynamic
    symbols.  It turns out this didn't matter, since we only emit these
    when generating an executable and in an executable it only matters
    whether a symbol is defined or undefined, but it leads to perplexing
    code full of mysterious constants.
    
    Unfortunately, this happens too early to put in real section indexes,
    so just use section index 1 to distinguish the symbol from an
    undefined symbol.
