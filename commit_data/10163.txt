    Back then, every x.go file in a package became an x.6 file
    in the archive.  It was important to be able to allow the
    use of long Go source file names, hence the increase in size.
    
    Today, all Go source files compile into a single _go_.6 file
    regardless of their names, so the archive file name length
    no longer needs to be long.  The longer name causes some
    problems on Plan 9, where the native archive format is the
    same but with 16-byte names, so revert back to 16.
