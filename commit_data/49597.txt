    cmd/link: explicitly disable PIE for windows/amd64 -race mode
    
    Turn off PIE explicitly for windows/amd64 when -race is in effect,
    since at the moment the race detector runtime doesn't seem to handle
    PIE binaries correctly. Note that newer C compilers on windows
    produce PIE binaries by default, so the Go linker needs to explicitly
    turn off PIE when invoking the external linker in this case.
    
    Updates #53539.
