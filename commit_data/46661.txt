    debug/gosym: add hook to disable recovers
    
    debug/gosym assumes throughout that bogus input means a malformed file.
    That's generally true, but not when you're changing the package.
    In that case, the panic usually indicates a newly introduced bug,
    and seeing the panic is really useful.
    
    Add a manually-enabled way to make panics panic.
