    cmd/compile: fix out of memory when inlining closure
    
    CL 629195 strongly favor closure inlining, allowing closures to be
    inlined more aggressively.
    
    However, if the closure body contains a call to a function, which itself
    is one of the call arguments, it causes the infinite inlining.
    
    Fixing this by prevent this kind of functions from being inlinable.
    
    Fixes #72063
