commit e7ee268292a814fed6ebe7c81c808581f80d3416

    cmd/go: add -msan option
    
    The -msan option compiles Go code to use the memory sanitizer.  This is
    intended for use when linking with C/C++ code compiled with
    -fsanitize=memory.  When memory blocks are passed back and forth between
    C/C++ and Go, code in both languages will agree as to whether the memory
    is correctly initialized or not, and will report errors for any use of
    uninitialized memory.
