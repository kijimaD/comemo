    net: Plan 9: open data file and set remote-addr properly
    
    The data file should be opened when a Conn is first
    established, rather than waiting for the first Read or
    Write.
    
    Upon Close, we now make sure to try to close both, the
    ctl as well as data files and set both to nil, even in
    the face of errors, instead of returning early.
    
    The Accept call was not setting the remote address
    of the connection properly. Now, we read the correct
    file.
    
    Make functions that establish Conn use newTCPConn
    or newUDPConn.
