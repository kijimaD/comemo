    runtime: support new callbackasm1 calling convention on windows/arm
    
    This updates the callbacks implementation on windows/arm for the
    changes made in CL 258938. At the time, that was left as a TODO.
    
    At the same time, it also extends the previous support for only 4
    arguments to also support additional arguments on the stack. This is
    required for functions like SetWinEventHook, which take 7 arguments. It
    does this by pushing r0-r3 onto the stack before the normal prologue,
    and then pointing the args struct to that location.
    
    This is derived from CL 270077 and CL 270078.
    
    Updates #40724.
    Fixes #42591.
