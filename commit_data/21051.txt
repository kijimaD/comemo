    [dev.cc] cmd/go: adjust go, cgo builds & disable cc
    
    [This CL is part of the removal of C code from package runtime.
    See golang.org/s/dev.cc for an overview.]
    
    Make gcToolchain.cc return an error (no C compiler!).
    
    Adjust expectations of cgo, now that cgo does not write any C files
    (no C compiler!).
    
    For packages with .s files, invoke Go compiler with -asmhdr go_asm.h
    so that assembly files can use it. This applies to all packages but is only
    needed today by package runtime.
