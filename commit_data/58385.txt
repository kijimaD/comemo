    runtime: donate racectx to g0 in ReadMetricsSlow
    
    ReadMetricsSlow was updated to call the core of readMetrics on the
    systemstack to prevent issues with stat skew if the stack gets moved
    between readmemstats_m and readMetrics. However, readMetrics calls into
    the map implementation, which has race instrumentation. The system stack
    typically has no racectx set, resulting in crashes.
    
    Donate racectx to g0 like the tracer does, so that these accesses don't
    crash.
    
    For #60607.
