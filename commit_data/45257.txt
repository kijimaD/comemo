    cmd/go/internal/modload: in newRequirements, verify that rootModules is sorted
    
    The comment for the Requirements.rootModules field requires that it be
    "sorted and capped to length". I noticed that we were not capping it
    correctly â€” we were capping the local variable (the rorotModules
    argument itself) but not the struct field. That prompted me to
    question whether we were also at some point failing to sort it
    correctly, so I decided to add an explicit check.
    
    With the explicit check, all tests continue to pass.
    
    For #36460
