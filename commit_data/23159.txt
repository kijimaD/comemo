    runtime: use stripped test environment for TestGdbPython
    
    Most runtime tests that invoke the compiler to build a sub-test binary
    do so with a special environment constructed by testEnv that strips
    out environment variables that should apply to the test but not to the
    build.
    
    Fix TestGdbPython to use this test environment when invoking go build,
    like other tests do.
