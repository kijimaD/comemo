    doc.Example should not worry about unresolved blank identifiers
    
    https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#example_Scanner_custom is not directly
    runnable in the playground via godoc, but if I copy+paste the code into
    https://play.golang.org/ then it runs just fine.
    
    This seems to be due to the blank identifier being considered unresolved
    in the following line in the example:
    
    _, err = strconv.ParseInt(string(token), 10, 32)
    
    But that's the whole point of blank identifiers- they're not supposed
    to be resolved.  So let's skip adding the blank identifier to
    doc.playExample's unresolved map.
    
    Fixes #26447
