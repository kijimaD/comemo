    cmd/compile: don't insert VarDef for already-initialized results
    
    Currently, when we about to emit code that sets the function
    results and returns, it emits a VarDef. But in some cases, the
    result node is actually live and holding useful data. VarDef
    means that we are about to (re)initialize it so all previous
    data are dead, but that is not true. Don't insert that.
    
    Also don't add VarDef for register results. We are not going to
    store anything (currently it doesn't cause problem, just
    unnecessary).
