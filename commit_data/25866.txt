commit 8dd2ce2b980d341a4c88e4f3c95e4eca396b6a07
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    cmd/compile: factor our literal lexing from main lexer function
    
    Further reduces complexity of lexer.next which is now readable.
    Also removes the need to initialize various local variables in
    each next call even if they are not used for the current token.
    
    No measurable performance change for `time go build -a net/http`
    (best of 5 runs): difference < 0.3% (in the noise).
