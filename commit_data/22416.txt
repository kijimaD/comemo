    internal/trace: don't assume GC will start and end on same P
    
    Currently, GC disables preemption between the traceGCStart and
    traceGCDone, so it never moves Ps. Consequently, the trace verifier
    attaches information about GC to its per-P state and will fail if GC
    starts on one P and ends on another.
    
    GC will soon be preemptible and may end on a different P than it
    began. Hence, this change lifts this per-P verifier state to global
    state.
