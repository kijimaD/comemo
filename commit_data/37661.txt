    cmd/compile: don't combine load+op if the op has SymAddr arguments
    
    By combining the load+op, we may force the op to happen earlier in
    the store chain. That might force the SymAddr operation earlier, and
    in particular earlier than its corresponding VarDef. That leads to
    an invalid schedule, so avoid that.
    
    This is kind of a hack to work around the issue presented. I think
    the underlying problem, that LEAQ is not directly ordered with respect
    to its vardef, is the real problem. The benefit of this CL is that
    it fixes the immediate issue, is small, and obviously won't break
    anything. A real fix for this issue is much more invasive.
    
    The go binary is unchanged in size.
    This situation just doesn't occur very often.
    
    Fixes #28445
