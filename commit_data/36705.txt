    cmd/go: write an hgrc file in TestMoveHG
    
    Some variants of Mercurial respond differently to “permission denied” errors
    than to “file not found”, and we set HOME to point to an absolute path that may
    produce the former instead of the latter.
    
    To discourage Mercurial from trying HOME, give it an explicit (empty)
    configuration in the working directory instead.
