    spec: adjust rules for specific types once more
    
    Introduce a (local) notion of a set of representative types,
    which serves as a representation/approximation of an
    interface's actual type set. If the set of representative
    types is is non-empty and finite, it corresponds to the set
    of specific types of the interface.
    
    In the implementation, the set of representative types serves
    as a finite representation of an interface's type set, together
    with the set of methods.
