    cmd/go: emit go list error for local non-existant packages
    
    In CL 129061, a check was added for patterns that reference
    nonexistent local directories. While this prevented unnecessary
    network lookups (fixing #26874), it caused "go list -e" to exit with
    an error instead of listing packages with error messages.
    
    This change avoids the network lookup and does not exit for these
    kinds of packages. Errors are still reported by
    internal/load.LoadImport for packages that don't exist.
    
    Fixes #28023
