    time: add a sentence about distant times to time.Time.Unix
    
    Since Durations only span 290 years, they are not good for
    manipulating very remote times. I bounced off this problem recently
    while doing some astronomical calculations and it took me a while to
    realize I could get a 64-bit seconds value from time.Time.Unix and
    subtract two of them to evaluate the interval.
    
    I thought it worth adding a sentence to make this clear. It didn't
    occur to me for quite a while that "Unix time" spans a huge range in
    the Go library.
