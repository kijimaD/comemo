    cmd/dist: consistently use $GOROOT/bin/go instead of just "go"
    
    Also remove existing special cases that transform "go" into
    gorootBinGo, because they make debugging and code-reviews more
    difficult: log messages that don't include the full path can mask bugs
    like #31567, and the reader of the code has to trace through the
    various call chains to verify that the correct "go" is being used.
    
    Instead, we can make the use of the correct "go" command plainly
    obvious in the code by using one consistent name for it.
    (Prior to this CL, we had three different names for it:
    gorootBinGo, "go", and cmdGo. Now we have only one.
    
    Updates #31567.
