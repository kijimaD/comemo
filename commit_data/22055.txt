    runtime: adjust program counters in race detector
    
    In most cases we pass return PC to race detector,
    and race runtime subtracts one from them.
    However, in manual instrumentation in runtime
    we pass function start PC to race runtime.
    Race runtime can't distinguish these cases
    and so it does not subtract one from top PC.
    This leads to bogus line numbers in some cases.
    Make it consistent and always pass what looks
    like a return PC, so that race runtime can
    subtract one and still get PC in the same function.
    
    Also delete two unused functions.
    
    Update #8053
