    compress/gzip: specify when Reader.Header is valid
    
    The gzip package is asymmetrical in the way it handles headers.
    In Writer, the Header is written on the first call to Write, Flush, or Close.
    In Reader, the Header is read on calls to NewReader or Reset as opposed to
    after the first Read. Thus, we document this difference.
    
    Fixes #13211
