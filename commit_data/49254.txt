    runtime: deflake TestCgoPprofThread
    
    In TestCgoPprofThread, the (fake) cgo traceback function pretends
    all C CPU samples are in cpuHogThread. But if a profiling signal
    lands in C code but outside of that thread, e.g. before/when the
    thread is created, we will get a sample which looks like Go calls
    into cpuHogThread. This CL makes the cgo traceback function only
    return cpuHogThread PCs when a signal lands on that thread.
    
    May fix #52726.
