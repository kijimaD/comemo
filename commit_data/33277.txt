    crypto/{ecdsa,rsa}: rename argument to PrivateKey.Sign.
    
    The crypto.Signer interface takes pre-hased messages for ECDSA and RSA,
    but the argument in the implementations was called “msg”, not “digest”,
    which is confusing.
    
    This change renames them to help clarify the intended use.
