    rpc: clean up dregs from June 2010
    
    In June 2010 I accidentally checked in pending
    changes to package rpc in a compiler CL:
    https://golang.org/cl/1736041
    
    I backed them out by hand in a followup CL:
    https://golang.org/cl/1736042
    
    That followup CL missed the lines being deleted
    in this CL, spotted by Petar.
    
    hg diff -r 5678:5683 src/cmd/prof/gopprof \
            src/pkg/image/png/reader.go \
            src/pkg/rpc/client.go \
            src/pkg/rpc/jsonrpc/all_test.go \
            src/pkg/rpc/jsonrpc/server.go \
            src/pkg/rpc/server.go \
            test/arm-pass.txt
    
    confirms that these lines in server.go are the
    only ones that were missed by the original followup.
    
    Fixes #1583.
