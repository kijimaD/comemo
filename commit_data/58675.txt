    cmd/go/internal/work: allow a bunch of loong64-specific flags
    
    Recognize and allow all LoongArch-specific CFLAGS as standardized
    in the LoongArch Toolchain Conventions v1.1, and implemented in current
    versions of GCC and Clang, to enable advanced cgo use cases on loong64.
    These flags are also allowed for linker invocations in case of possible
    LTO.
    
    See: https://github.com/loongson/la-toolchain-conventions/blob/releases/v1.1/LoongArch-toolchain-conventions-EN.adoc#list
    
    While at it, also add support for -mtls-dialect as some C programs
    may benefit performance-wise from the optional TLSDESC usage. This flag
    is not specific to loong64 though; it is available for amd64, arm,
    arm64, loong64, riscv64 and x86.
    
    Fixes #71597.
