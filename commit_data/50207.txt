    go/types: use an identifier map rather than isubst for recv type params
    
    Receiver type parameters are the only type expressions allowed to be
    blank. Previously this was handled by substitution of synthetic
    non-blank names in the receiver type expression, but that introduced
    problems related to AST mangling: the scope had extra elements,
    Object.Name() was inaccurate, and synthetic nodes were recorded in
    types.Info.
    
    Fix this instead by recording a map of *ast.Ident->*TypeParam on the
    Checker, which is read in Checker.ident to resolve blank identifiers
    denoting receiver type parameters.
