commit 92b4741728faca77329b204340b02e8df4f4d097

    runtime: if traceback sees a breakpoint, don't change the PC
    
    Changing the PC confuses gdb, because execution does not
    continue where gdb expects it.  Not changing the PC has the
    potential to confuse a stack dump, but when running under gdb
    it seems better to confuse a stack dump than to confuse gdb.
    
    Fixes #6776.
