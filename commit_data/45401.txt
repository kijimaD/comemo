    cmd/gofmt: simplify arg handling
    
    First, we can use flag.Args instead of flag.NArg and flag.Arg.
    
    Second, just call filepath.WalkDir directly on each argument. We don't
    need to check if each argument is a directory or not, since the function
    will still work on regular files as expected.
    
    To continue giving an error in the "gofmt does-not-exist.go" case, we
    now need to return and handle errors from filepath.WalkDir, too.
    Arguably, that should have always been the case.
    
    While at it, I noticed that the printinf of the "diff" command did not
    obey the "out" parameter. Fix that.
    
    Finally, remove the code to ignore IsNotExist errors. It was added in CL
    19301, though it didn't include tests and its reasoning is dubious.
    Using gofmt on a directory treewhile another program is concurrently
    editing or removing files is inherently racy. Hiding errors can hide
    valid problems from the user, and such racy usages aren't supported.
