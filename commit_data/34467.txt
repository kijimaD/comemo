    os/signal: disable loading of history during test
    
    This change modifies Go to disable loading of users' shell history for
    TestTerminalSignal tests. TestTerminalSignal, as part of its workload,
    will execute a new interactive bash shell. Bash will attempt to load the
    user's history from the file pointed to by the HISTFILE environment
    variable. For users with large histories that may take up to several
    seconds, pushing the whole test past the 5 second timeout and causing
    it to fail.
