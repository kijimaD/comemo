    make.bash: avoid warning when bootstrap doesn't support GOOS/GOARCH
    
    Currently, if make.bash is run with a GOOS or GOARCH that the
    bootstrap toolchain doesn't support, it will print an ominous but
    harmless warning like:
    
      2020/09/21 09:05:27 unsupported GOARCH arm64
    
    This comes from the invocation of "go version" to get the exact
    bootstrap toolchain version.
    
    Since the GOOS and GOARCH don't matter for this purpose, this CL
    simply clears them on the invocation of the bootstrap toolchain's "go
    version".
    
    Fixes #41525.
