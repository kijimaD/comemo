    cmd/compile: in prove, shortcircuit self-facts
    
    Sometimes, we can end up calling update with a self-relation
    about a variable (x REL x). In this case, there is no need
    to record anything: the relation is unsatisfiable if and only
    if it doesn't contain eq.
    
    This also helps avoiding infinite loop in next CL that will
    introduce transitive closure of relations.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
