    spec: clarify that signed integers>=0 are permitted as shift counts
    
    In Go1.13 and above, signed integers are permitted as shift counts as long as they are >=0.
    However, the comments in the "Arithmetic operators" section says shift operators accept "unsigned integer" as of right operands. Replacing this with "integer>=0" resolves the misunderstanding that shift
    operators permit only unsigned integers.
