    runtime: don't terminate locked OS threads on Plan 9
    
    CL 46037 and CL 46038 implemented termination of
    locked OS threads when the goroutine exits.
    
    However, this behavior leads to crashes of Go programs
    using runtime.LockOSThread on Plan 9. This is notably
    the case of the os/exec and net packages.
    
    This change disables termination of locked OS threads
    on Plan 9.
    
    Updates #22227.
