    runtime: fix stackFromSystem returning memory
    
    The stackFromSystem debug mode has two problems:
    
    1) It rounds the stack allocation to _PageSize. If the physical page
    size is >8K, this can cause unmapping the memory later to either
    under-unmap or over-unmap.
    
    2) It doesn't return the rounded-up allocation size to its caller, so
    when we later unmap the memory, we may pass the wrong length.
    
    Fix these problems by rounding the size up to the physical page size
    and putting that rounded-up size in the returned stack bounds.
    
    Fixes #17289.
