    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: support additional register to register moves
    
    Add support for signed and unsigned register to register moves of various
    sizes. This makes it easier to handle zero and sign extension and will allow
    for further changes that improve the compiler optimisations for riscv64.
    
    While here, change the existing register to register moves from obj.Prog
    rewriting to instruction generation.
