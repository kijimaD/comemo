    go/types: add additional test data from types2
    
    Add some test data files that were not included in go/types.
    
    - Issue 43125 only pertained to types2 because go/ast differentiates
      StarExpr, UnaryExpr, and BinaryExpr, so typexpr.go was already
      catching the invalid type expressions.
    - Issues 42987 and 43190 are handled differently by go/parser.
    - main.go2 was not added when ported to go/types, because this work
      happened on the dev.regabi branch, which didn't support generics.
    
    Test files are modified to adjust errors messages and positions, and to
    update the copyright year.
