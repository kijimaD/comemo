    cmd/compile: revise inliner coverage tweaks (again)
    
    This patch fixes a typo/bug introduced in CL 441858 where when pattern
    matching a coverage counter access we were looking at an assingment
    node instead of the assignment LHS, and fixes a similar problem in
    atomic counter update pattern matching introduced in CL 444835. In
    both of these cases the bug was not caught because the test intended
    to lock down the behavior was written incorrectly (wasn't
    instrumenting what the test author thought it was instrumenting,
    ouch).
