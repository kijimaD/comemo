    runtime: execute TestSpuriousWakeupsNeverHangSemasleep in parallel
    
    This test spends most of its time sleeping and waiting on a subprocess
    to sleep. It seems like a prime candidate to run in parallel, although
    we may need to relax its hard-coded 2s timeout on the sleep(1)
    subprocess.
    
    For #48770
