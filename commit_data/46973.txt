    runtime: find g in Windows profiler using SP
    
    The architecture-specific interpretation of m->tls[0]
    is unnecessary and fragile. Delete it.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
