    cmd/compile: remove broken rules
    
    These rules don't even type check.  ADDQconstmodify returns memory,
    and it is being rewritten to a value that returns an int64.
    
    There should be a MOVQstore wrapped around the result.
    These rules never fire during all.bash, so they aren't even tested.
    
    I'm just going to remove them for now.
