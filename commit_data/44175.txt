    runtime: add a barrier after a new span is allocated
    
    When copying a stack, we
    1. allocate a new stack,
    2. adjust pointers pointing to the old stack to pointing to the
       new stack.
    
    If the GC is running on another thread concurrently, on a machine
    with weak memory model, the GC could observe the adjusted pointer
    (e.g. through gp._defer which could be a special heap-to-stack
    pointer), but not observe the publish of the new stack span. In
    this case, the GC will see the adjusted pointer pointing to an
    unallocated span, and throw. Fixing this by adding a publication
    barrier between the allocation of the span and adjusting pointers.
    
    One testcase for this is TestDeferHeapAndStack in long mode. It
    fails reliably on linux-mips64le-mengzhuo builder without the fix,
    and passes reliably after the fix.
    
    Fixes #35541.
