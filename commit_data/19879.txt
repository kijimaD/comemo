    spec: comma-ok expressions return untyped boolean 2nd result
    
    Technically a language change, this cleanup is a completely
    backward compatible change that brings the boolean results
    of comma-ok expressions in line with the boolean results of
    comparisons: they are now all untyped booleans.
    
    The implementation effort should be minimal (less than a
    handfull lines of code, depending how well factored the
    implementation of comma-ok expressions is).
    
    Fixes #8189.
