    runtime: fix sigtrampPC on Windows
    
    The arm5 build breakage at CL 139110043 was caused by
    calling funcPC on a lessstack defined as a struct{}.
    That symbol ended up with a non-4-aligned address,
    which caused the memory fault that broke the builders.
    The definition of lessstack was fixed in CL 140880043.
    
    Tracking that down suggested that it would be worth
    looking for the same bug elsewhere in the directory.
    This is the only one I found.
