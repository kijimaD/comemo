    cmd/cover: fix sorting of profile segment boundaries
    
    If a span of coverable code is empty (e.g. an empty select clause)
    then there will be two Boundary values with the same offset. In that
    case, the starting Boundary needs to come first so that the generated
    HTML output will open the <span> tag before it tries to close it.
