    text/template: provide a way to trim leading and trailing space between actions
    
    Borrowing a suggestion from the issue listed below, we modify the lexer to
    trim spaces at the beginning (end) of a block of text if the action immediately
    before (after) is marked with a minus sign. To avoid parsing/lexing ambiguity,
    we require an ASCII space between the minus sign and the rest of the action.
    Thus:
    
            {{23 -}}
            <
            {{- 45}}
    
    produces the output
            23<45
    
    All the work is done in the lexer. The modification is invisible to the parser
    or any outside package (except I guess for noticing some gaps in the input
    if one tracks error positions). Thus it slips in without worry in text/template
    and html/template both.
    
    Fixes long-requested issue #9969.
