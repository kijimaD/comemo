    net/http: optimize StatusText implementation
    
    The current implementation, although more succinct, relies on a runtime
    lookup to a "constant" unexported map (which also needs to be
    initialized at runtime).
    
    The proposed implementation is able to be optimized by the compiler at
    build-time, resulting in *much* more efficient instructions.
    Additionally, unused string literals may even be removed altogether
    from the generated binary in some cases.
    
    This change is fully backwards-compatible behavior-wise with the
    existing implementation.
