    syscall/js: add package
    
    This commit adds the syscall/js package, which is used by the wasm
    architecture to access the WebAssembly host environment (and the
    operating system through it). Currently, web browsers and Node.js
    are supported hosts, which is why the API is based on JavaScript APIs.
    There is no common API standardized in the WebAssembly ecosystem yet.
    
    This package is experimental. Its current scope is only to allow
    tests to run, but not yet to provide a comprehensive API for users.
    
    Updates #18892
