    cmd/covdata: format package comment for 'go doc' rendering
    
    Due to an errant newline, both 'go doc' and pkg.go.dev currently
    interpret the long comment in cmd/covdata/doc.go as a file comment
    instead of package documentation.
    
    Removing the errant newline caused 'go doc' to render the comment, but
    it does not strip out the interior '//' tokens from the '/* â€¦ */'
    block.
    
    Removing those tokens and fixing up indentation seems to give
    satisfactory rendering.
