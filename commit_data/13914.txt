    time: prepare for 64-bit ints
    
    The code was trying to interpret a uint32 n as a signed quantity
    and then store it in an int. For this, int(n) currently works, but when
    int becomes 64 bits one must write int(int32(n)) instead, to get
    the 32-bit sign extension.
    
    Update #2188.
