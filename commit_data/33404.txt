    cmd/compile: set itab function pointers at compile time
    
    I noticed that we don't set an itab's function pointers at compile
    time. Instead, we currently do it at executable startup.
    
    Set the function pointers at compile time instead. This shortens
    startup time. It has no effect on normal binary size. Object files
    will have more relocations, but that isn't a big deal.
    
    For PIE there are additional pointers that will need to be adjusted at
    load time. There are already other pointers in an itab that need to be
    adjusted, so the cache line will already be paged in. There might be
    some binary size overhead to mark these pointers. The "go test -c
    -buildmode=pie net/http" binary is 0.18% bigger.
    
    Update #20505
