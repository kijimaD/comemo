    runtime: clarify GOROOT return value in documentation
    
    The current GOROOT documentation could indicate that changing the
    environment variable at runtime would affect the return value of
    GOROOT. This is false as the returned value is the one used for the
    build. This CL aims to clarify the confusion.
    
    Fixes #22302
