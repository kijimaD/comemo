    runtime: minor clean up to heapminimum
    
    Currently setGCPercent sets heapminimum to heapminimum*GOGC/100. The
    real intent is to set heapminimum to a scaled multiple of a fixed
    default heap minimum, not to scale heapminimum based on its current
    value. This turns out to be okay because setGCPercent is only called
    once and heapminimum is initially set to this default heap minimum.
    However, the code as written is confusing, especially since
    setGCPercent is otherwise written so it could be called again to
    change GOGC. Fix this by introducing a defaultHeapMinimum constant and
    using this instead of the current value of heapminimum to compute the
    scaled heap minimum.
    
    As part of this, this commit improves the documentation on
    heapminimum.
