    [dev.unified] cmd/compile/internal/noder: simplify mixed tag/case RTTI wiring
    
    The previous CL largely removed the need for worrying about mixed
    tag/case comparisons in switch statements by ensuring they're always
    converted to a common type, except for one annoying case: switch
    statements with an implicit `true` tag, and case values of interface
    type (which must be empty interface, because `bool`'s method set is
    empty).
    
    It would be simpler to have writer.go desugar the implicit `true`
    itself, because we already handle explicit `true` correctly. But the
    existing code already works fine, and I don't want to add further
    complexity to writer.go until dictionaries and stenciling is done.
