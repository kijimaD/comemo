    net: make all.bat run for ordinary Windows users
    
    This CL is required for all.bat to work out of the box on
    my Windows 8 laptop.
    
    These tests either require the firewall to be turned off
    or require the user to be in the Administrators group.
    I don't know which.
    
    Alex may follow up with a refinement of the test to
    allow them to run if the user is in the Administrators
    group.
    
    Fixes #6392.
