    runtime: execute publicationBarrier in noscan case for delayed zeroing
    
    This is a peace-of-mind change to make sure that delayed-zeroed memory
    (in the large alloc case) is globally visible from the moment the
    allocation is published back to the caller.
    
    The way it's written right now is good enough for the garbage collector
    (we already have a publication barrier for a nil span.largeType, so the
    GC will ignore the noscan span) but this might matter for user code on
    weak memory architectures.
