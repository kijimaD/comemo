    math/big: make nat.setUint64 vet-friendly
    
    nat.setUint64 is nicely generic.
    By assuming 32- or 64-bit words, however,
    we can write simpler code,
    and eliminate some shifts
    in dead code that vet complains about.
    
    Generated code for 64 bit systems is unaltered.
    Generated code for 32 bit systems is much better.
    For 386, the routine length drops from 325
    bytes of code to 271 bytes of code, with fewer loops.
