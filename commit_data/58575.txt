    runtime: add crash stack support for wasm
    
    Currently if morestack on g0 happens the wasm runtime prints
    "RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds", which is quite misleading.
    By switching to a crash stack we can get better stacktraces
    for the error.
    
    There is no way to automate tests for this feature on wasm, since
    TestG0StackOverflow relies on spawning a subprocess which is not
    supported by the wasm port.
    
    The way I got this tested manually is to comment everything in
    TestG0StackOverflow, leaving just runtime.G0StackOverflow().
    
    Then it is a matter of invoking the test:
    
        GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test runtime -v -run=TestG0StackOverflow
