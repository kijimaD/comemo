    cmd/compile: make "imported and not used" errors deterministic
    
    If there were more unused imports than
    the maximum default number of errors to report,
    the set of reported imports was non-deterministic.
    
    Fix by accumulating and sorting them prior to output.
    
    Fixes #20298
