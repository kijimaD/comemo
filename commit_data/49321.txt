    go/types, types2: remove redundant calls to Named.resolve
    
    The resolved status of a Named type should be owned by its API, and
    callers should access resolved data via methods. Remove several
    instances where Named.resolve is explicitly invoked, only to be followed
    by a method that also resolves.
    
    Also make two minor cleanups:
    - Remove the tparams parameter to Checker.newNamed, as it was unused.
    - Include position information when assertions fail, so that one doesn't
      need to go digging in the panicking stack to find the assertion
      location.
    
    Updates #52728
