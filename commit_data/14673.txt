    cmd/gc: add GOEXPERIMENT=zerostack to clear stack on function entry
    
    This is expensive but it might be useful in cases where
    people are suffering from false positives during garbage
    collection and are willing to trade the CPU time for getting
    rid of the false positives.
    
    On the other hand it only eliminates false positives caused
    by other function calls, not false positives caused by dead
    temporaries stored in the current function call.
    
    The 5g/6g/8g changes were pulled out of the history, from
    the last time we needed to do this (to work around a goto bug).
    The code in go.h, lex.c, pgen.c is new but tiny.
