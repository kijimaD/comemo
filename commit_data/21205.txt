    build: add GOTESTONLY environment test for Plan 9's run.rc
    
    $GOTESTONLY controls which set of tests gets run. Only "std" is
    supported. This should bring the time of plan9 builder down
    from 90 minutes to a maybe 10-15 minutes when running on GCE.
    
    (Plan 9 has performance problems when running on GCE, and/or with the
    os/exec package)
    
    This is a temporary workaround for one builder. The other Plan 9
    builders will continue to do full builds. The plan9 buidler will be
    renamed plan9-386-gcepartial or something to indicate it's not running
    the 'test/*' directory, or API tests. Go on Plan 9 has bigger problems
    for now. This lets us get trybots going sooner including Plan 9,
    without waiting 90+ minutes.
    
    Update #9491
