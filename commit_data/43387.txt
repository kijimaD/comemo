    cmd/go/internal/renameio: include ios in the darwin test-flake mitigation
    
    Because the "ios" build constraint implies "darwin", it is already
    included in the general "darwin" flakiness workaround in
    cmd/go/internal/robustio. We just need to relax the renameio test
    to avoid false-positives there.
    
    I do not expect this change to drive the rate of false-positives down
    to zero, but it should at least reduce noise on the build dashboard.
    
    For #42066
