    syscall: correct code for cover cmd
    
    Fixes #10378
    
    This is clumsy, but currently cover tool fails as:
    
    $ go test -run=none -cover syscall
    syscall_linux_amd64.go:15: can only use //go:noescape with external func implementations
    FAIL    syscall [build failed]
    
    This happens because cover tool mishandles //go: comments.
    r and gri said that fixing cover is infeasible due to go/ast limitations.
    
    So at least fix the offending code so that coverage works.
    This come up in context of coverage-guided fuzzing which works best
    with program-wide coverage.
