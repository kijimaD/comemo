    image/jpeg: increase TestLargeImageWithShortData timeout by an order of magnitude
    
    Also dump goroutines on failure.
    
    The original bug report in #10413 reported a hang of “several
    minutes”. An apparently-spurious failure was observed in
    https://build.golang.org/log/e5ac3ce3fb7d04ec13e5bbfadea8bb5869a4dd1e,
    with a delay of only 3.64s.
    
    Moreover, if the test does fail due to a regression, we will want a
    goroutine dump to diagnose where it got stuck. The current call to
    t.Fatalf does not produce such a dump, so is not nearly as useful if
    the failure only occasionally reproduces.
    
    Updates #10413.
