    cmd/dist: allow builders to control granularity of test/ directory sharding
    
    Even with 10 shards on builders, it still takes about ~2.5 minutes per
    shard (and getting slower all the time as the test/ directory grows).
    I'm currently experimenting with massively sharding out testing on
    Cloud Run (each dist test & normal TestFoo func all running in
    parallel), and in such a setup, 2.5 minutes is an eternity. I'd like
    to increase that dist test's sharding from 10 to more like 1,000.
    
    Updates golang/go#31834
