    runtime: run debuglog tests when debuglog tag is *not* set
    
    Currently, the debuglog tests only run when the debuglog build tag is
    set because, until the last few CLs, all of debuglog was compiled away
    without that build tag. This causes two annoying problems:
    
    1. The tests basically never run, because we don't regularly test this
    configuration.
    
    2. If you do turn on the debuglog build tag, it's probably because
    you're adding debuglogs into the runtime, which are very likely to
    mess up these tests, so you wind up disabling the tests and they,
    again, don't get coverage.
    
    Now we've set things up so the debuglog implementation is always
    accessible, if you ask nicely enough. So we can switch these tests to
    run when the tag is *not* set, and turn off when the tag *is* set (and
    you're probably adding actual log statements).
