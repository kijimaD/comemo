    runtime: don't ignore success of cgo profiling tracebacks
    
    If a sigprof happens during a cgo call, we traceback from the entry
    point of the cgo call. However, if the SP is outside of the G's stack,
    we'll then ignore this traceback, even if it was successful, and
    overwrite it with just _ExternalCode.
    
    Fix this by accepting any successful traceback, regardless of whether
    we got it from a cgo entry point or from regular Go code.
    
    Fixes #13466.
