    cmd/compile: eliminate more nil checks of phis
    
    The existing implementation started by eliminating
    nil checks for OpAddr, OpAddPtr, and OpPhis with
    all non-nil args.
    
    However, some OpPhis had all non-nil args,
    but their args had not been processed yet.
    
    Pull the OpPhi checks into their own loop,
    and repeat until stabilization.
    
    Eliminates a dozen additional nilchecks during make.bash.
    
    Negligible compiler performance impact.
