    runtime: add arg maps for sync/atomic functions in ARM64 race mode
    
    In race mode, these functions are defined and declared in
    different packages, which therefore don't have implicit arg maps.
    When they are defer'd, and the stack needs to move, the runtime
    fails with missing stack maps. This CL adds arg maps (FUNCDATA)
    to them.
