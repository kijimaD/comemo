    os: embed "sleep 1" within the test binary itself.
    
    This is an alternative to http://golang.org/cl/4150,
    and is motivated by a review comment on that CL.
    
    testKillProcess() tries to build and run the Go equivalent
    for "sleep 1". This doesn't work for testing cross compilers
    since the Go compiler is not available on the targets. This
    change embeds the "sleep 1" functionality within the "os.test"
    binary itself.
