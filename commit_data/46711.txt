    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: refactor irgen's handling of ":="
    
    The previous code was stylized after noder, which was written when it
    was more idiomatic to simple create a gc.Node and then populate and
    shuffle around its fields as appropriate.
    
    Now with package ir, it's somewhat nicer to compute all the fields up
    front and pass them to the constructor functions, rather than passing
    nil and populating the fields afterwards.
    
    Net addition of lines of code, but I think the new code is overall
    still somewhat simpler, and will be easier to refactor out into code
    for helpers.go.
