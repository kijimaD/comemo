    runtime: check for overflow in sweep assist
    
    The sweep assist computation is intentionally racy for performance,
    since the specifics of sweep assist aren't super sensitive to error.
    However, if overflow occurs when computing the live heap delta, we can
    end up with a massive sweep target that causes the sweep assist to sweep
    until sweep termination, causing severe latency issues. In fact, because
    heapLive doesn't always increase monotonically then anything that
    flushes mcaches will cause _all_ allocating goroutines to inevitably get
    stuck in sweeping.
    
    Consider the following scenario:
    1. SetGCPercent is called, updating sweepHeapLiveBasis to heapLive.
    2. Very shortly after, ReadMemStats is called, flushing mcaches and
       decreasing heapLive below the value sweepHeapLiveBasis was set to.
    3. Every allocating goroutine goes to refill its mcache, calls into
       deductSweepCredit for sweep assist, and gets stuck sweeping until
       the sweep phase ends.
    
    Fix this by just checking for overflow in the delta live heap calculation
    and if it would overflow, pick a small delta live heap. This probably
    means that no sweeping will happen at all, but that's OK. This is a
    transient state and the runtime will recover as soon as heapLive
    increases again.
    
    Note that deductSweepCredit doesn't check overflow on other operations
    but that's OK: those operations are signed and extremely unlikely to
    overflow. The subtraction targeted by this CL is only a problem because
    it's unsigned. An alternative fix would be to make the operation signed,
    but being explicit about the overflow situation seems worthwhile.
    
    Fixes #57523.
