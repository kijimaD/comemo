    crypto/x509: support the PSS certificates that OpenSSL 1.1.0 generates.
    
    It serialises optional parameters as empty rather than NULL. It's
    probably technically correct, although ASN.1 has a long history of doing
    this different ways.
    
    But OpenSSL is likely common enough that we want to support this
    encoding.
    
    Fixes #23847
