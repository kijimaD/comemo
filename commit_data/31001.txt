    syscall: update comments for x/sys migration
    
    The comments in this package state that users should be
    migrating code that uses the syscall package to its
    corresponding package in x/sys. However, the syscall.Signal
    and syscall.Errno types and the syscall.SysProcAttr struct is
    not defined in the x/sys package and still need to be referenced
    from within syscall.  This adds a change to the comments to
    clarify that the migration will need to continue to use some
    references to syscall for now.
    
    Fixes #19560
