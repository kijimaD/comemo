    runtime: clear f, arg to avoid leak in timerproc
    
    I have seen this cause leaks where not all objects in a sync.Pool
    would be reclaimed during the sync package tests.
    I found it while debugging the '0 of 100 finalized' failure we are
    seeing on arm, but it seems not to be the root cause for that one.
