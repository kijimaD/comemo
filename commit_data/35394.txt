    misc/wasm: fix passing large negative integers from JS to Go
    
    This commit addresses a FIXME left in the code of wasm_exec.js to
    properly get the upper 32 bit of a JS number to be stored as an
    64-bit integer. A bitshift operation is not possible, because in
    JavaScript bitshift operations only operate on the lower 32 bits.
