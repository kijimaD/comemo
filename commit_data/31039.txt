    all: test adjustments for the iOS builder
    
    The working directory is now adjusted to match the typical Go test
    working directory in main, as the old trick for adjusting earlier
    stopped working with the latest version of LLDB bugs.
    
    That means the small number of places where testdata files are
    read before main is called no longer work. This CL adjusts those
    reads to happen after main is called. (This has the bonus effect of
    not reading some benchmark testdata files in all.bash.)
    
    Fixes compress/bzip2, go/doc, go/parser, os, and time package
    tests on the iOS builder.
