    cmd/go: add go1.1 build tag, add -installsuffix flag
    
    The new build tag "go1.1" will be satisfied by any Go 1.z release >= 1.1.
    In general, the build tag "go1.x" will be satisfied by any Go 1.z release >= 1.x.
    What happens when we reach Go 2 is yet to be decided.
    
    The tags "go1" or "go1.0" are missing, because +build tags did not exist
    before then, and also because the Go 1.0 releases do not recognize them.
    
    The new -installsuffix flag gives access to the build context's InstallSuffix
    (formerly named InstallTag, but not part of Go 1.0), for use in isolating
    builds to custom directories. For example -race implies -installsuffix race,
    and an AppEngine-specific build might use -tags appengine -installsuffix appengine.
    
    Fixes #4116.
    Fixes #4443.
