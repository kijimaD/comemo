    doc: update Usage section of the FAQ
    
    This is close to a complete rewrite, as the content was pretty old.
    
    The CL includes links to the Wiki for information about companies
    using Go, a new section about IDEs and editors¹, and a restatement
    of the foreign function interface story. It also modernizes and
    expands a little on the use of Go inside Google.
    
    ¹ Ed is the standard editor.
