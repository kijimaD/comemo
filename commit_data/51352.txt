    cmd/compile: simplify PGO hot caller/callee computation
    
    Currently, we use CDF to compute a weight threshold and then use
    the weight threshold to determine whether a call site is hot. As
    when we compute the CDF we already have a list of hot call sites
    that make up the given percentage of the CDF, just use that list.
    
    Also, when computing the CDF threshold, include the very last node
    that makes it to go over the threshold. (I.e. if the CDF threshold
    is 50% and one hot node takes 60% of weight, we should include that
    node instead of excluding it. In practice it rarely matters,
    probably only for testing and micro-benchmarks.)
