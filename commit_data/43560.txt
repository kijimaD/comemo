    doc/go1.16: document BuildID in 'go list -export'
    
    This corresponds to the feature in https://golang.org/cl/263542, since
    this can be a noteworthy change to people writing tools to inspect Go
    builds.
    
    Also amend the wording to clarify that build IDs are for an entire
    compiled package, not just their export data or object file.
