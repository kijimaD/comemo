    net/http: soften wording around when the Transport reuses connections
    
    The docs were too specific. Make it vaguer. There are conditions for
    which the Transport will try to reuse a connection anyway, even if the
    Response Body isn't read to EOF or closed, but we don't need to get
    into all the details in the docs.
    
    Fixes #22954
