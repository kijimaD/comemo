    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: swap inlining order of if then vs else blocks
    
    The upcoming general iterators will process nodes in
    source code order, meaning that the "then" block comes
    before the "else" block. But for an if node, "then" is Body
    while "else" is Rlist, and the inliner processes Rlist first.
    
    The order of processing changes the order of inlining decisions,
    which can affect which functions are inlined, but in general
    won't affect much. (It's not like we know that we should prefer
    to inline functions in else bodies over then bodies.)
    
    Swapping these is not safe for toolstash -cmp.
    Doing it in a separate CL lets the upcoming CLs all be toolstash-safe.
