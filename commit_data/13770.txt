+Why does the project use Mercurial and not git?</h3>
+
+<p>
+The Go project, hosted by Google Code at
+<a href="http://code.google.com/p/go">code.google.com/p/go</a>,
+uses Mercurial as its version control system.
+When the project launched,
+Google Code supported only Subversion and Mercurial.
+Mercurial was a better choice because of its plugin mechanism
+that allowed us to create the "codereview" plugin to connect
+the project to the excellent code review tools at 
+<a href="http://codereview.appspot.com">codereview.appspot.com</a>.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Programmers who work
+with the Go project's source rather than release downloads sometimes
+ask for the project to switch to git.
+That would be possible, but it would be a lot of work and
+would also require reimplementing the codereview plugin.
+Given that Mercurial works today, with code review support,
+combined with the Go project's mostly linear, non-branching use of
+version control, a switch to git doesn't seem worthwhile.
