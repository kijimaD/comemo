    go/types, types2: use same method lookup code in both type checkers
    
    types2 has some code to handle case-folding when doing method lookups
    which was missing in go/types. This change is a first step to match
    the implementations. Specifically:
    
    In types2:
    - remove the lookupMethodFold names in favor of just lookupMethod,
      but with the foldCase flag (e.g., instead if lookupMethodFold,
      we just use lookupMethod)
    - rename checkFold to foldCase everywhere
    - add foldCase parameter where it was missing
    - moved foldCase paremeter to the end in lookupFieldOrMethod
    - no functionality changes
    
    In go/types:
    - match function signatures with types2 use
    - always provide false as argument for foldCase for now
    - no functionality changes
    
    Preparation for fixing some of the outstanding error reporting issues.
