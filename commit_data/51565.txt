    go/types, types2: no need to revert tparam renaming in inference results
    
    This is a follow up to CL 385494. In early patch sets of that CL,
    renamed type parameters were substituted in arguments, which meant that
    they could leak into the inference results. However, we subsequently
    realized that we could instead substitute in the signature parameters.
    In this case it is not possible for the substituted type parameters to
    appear in the resulting type arguments, so there is no need to
    un-substitute.
