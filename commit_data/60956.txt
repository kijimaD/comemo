    cmd/go: explicitly add default GODEBUG to linker config
    
    Previously we expected the default GODEBUG that's embedded in the binary
    to be taken into account for build actionIDs through the build info. The
    build info contains the default GODEBUG for a package main, and then
    that build info is used to generate the action id. But tests of packages
    other than main do not have buildinfo set on them. So the default
    GODEBUG isn't taken into account in the action id for those tests.
    Explicitly include GODEBUG when generating all link actions' action ids
    to make sure it's always present.
    
    Fixes #69203
