    cmd/compile/internal/inline: minor compile time improvements in func flags
    
    Some small changes to help reduce compile time for function flags
    computation. The current implementation of panic path detection adds
    an entry to a map for every node in the function, which is wasteful
    (and shows up in cpu profiles). Switch to only adding entries where
    they are useful. This is especially important for functions with large
    map literals and other constructs with many non-statement nodes.
