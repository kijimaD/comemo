    runtime, cmd/internal/ld: initialize themoduledata slices directly
    
    This CL is quite conservative in some ways.  It continues to define
    symbols that have no real purpose (e.g. epclntab).  These could be
    deleted if there is no concern that external tools might look for them.
    
    It would also now be possible to make some changes to the pcln data but
    I get the impression that would definitely require some thought and
    discussion.
