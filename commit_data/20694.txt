    reflect: generated unrolled GC bitmask directly
    
    The code for a generated type is already generating an
    unrolled GC bitmask.  Rather than unrolling the the source
    type bitmasks and copying them, just generate the required
    bitmask directly.  Don't mark it as an unrolled GC program,
    since there is no need to do so.
    
    Fixes #8917.
