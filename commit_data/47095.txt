    go/types: review of call.go
    
    The changes from the (reviewed) dev.regabi copy of call.go can be seen
    by comparing patchset 1 and 4. The actual changes are removing the
    "// REVIEW INCOMPLETE" marker, deleting some leftover handling of type
    instantiation in Checker.call, and adding a comment that exprOrTypeList
    should be refactored.
    
    I started to refactor exprOrTypeList, but thought it best to mark this
    code as reviewed before diverging from types2.
