    go/types, types2: AssertableTo is undefined for generalized interfaces
    
    Document that AssertableTo is undefined (at least for 1.18) if
    the first argument is a generalized interface; i.e., an interface
    that may only be used as a constraint in Go code.
    
    Still, implement it as we might expect it to be defined in the
    future, to prevent problems down the road due to Hyrum's Law.
    
    While at it, also removed the internal flag forceStrict and its
    one use in Checker.assertableTo; forceStrict was never enabled
    and if it would have been enabled, the behavior would not have
    been correct.
