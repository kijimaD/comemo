    doc/go1.3.html: change uintptr to integer in unsafe.Pointer section
    
    The key property here is what the bit pattern represents,
    not what its type is. Storing 5 into a pointer is the problem.
    Storing a uintptr that holds pointer bits back into a pointer
    is not as much of a problem, and not what we are claiming
    the runtime will detect.
