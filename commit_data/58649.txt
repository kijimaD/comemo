    runtime/internal/atomic: deduplicate And/Or code on wasm
    
    When I initially added the wasm code for these ops I did not saw that
    wasm actually has the Cas operations implemented, although they are
    merely pointer assignments since wasm is single threaded.
    
    Now with a generic implementation for And/Or we can add wasm to the
    build tags.
    
    For #61395
