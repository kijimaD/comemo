    [dev.boringcrypto] cmd/go: exclude SysoFiles when using -msan
    
    There's no way for a *.syso file to be compiled to work both in
    normal mode and in msan mode. Assume they are compiled in
    normal mode and drop them in msan mode.
    
    Packages with syso files currently fail in -msan mode because
    the syso file calls out to a routine like memcmp which then
    falsely reports uninitialized memory. After this CL, they will fail
    in -msan with link errors, because the syso will not be used.
    But then it will at least be possible for package authors to write
    fallback code in the package that avoids the syso in -msan mode,
    so that the package with the syso can at least run in both modes.
    Without this CL, that's not possible.
    
    See #21884.
