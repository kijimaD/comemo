    debug/macho: add comments for ambiguious LoadCommand
    
    While LoadCmdDylib represents LC_LOAD_DYLIB,
    LoadCmdDylinker represents LC_ID_DYLINKER.
    This is confusing because there is another command called LC_LOAD_DYLINKER.
    LC_ID_DYLINKER is not included in normal binary, it is only used for
    /usr/lib/dyld as far as I know. So, perhaps this is a mistake.
