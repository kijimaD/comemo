    syscall: optimize Byte{Ptr,Slice}FromString
    
    Use bytealg.IndexByteString(str, 0) instead of looping through the
    string to check for a zero byte. A quick and dirty benchmark shows 10x
    performance improvement (on amd64 machine, using go 1.17.3).
    
    BytePtrFromString is used by many functions with string arguments.
    This change should make many functions in os package, such as those
    accepting a filename (os.Open, os.Stat, etc.), a tad faster.
    
    PS I am aware that syscall package is deprecated and frozen, but this
    change is mainly for the os package and the likes. The alternative
    would be for os to switch to x/sys, which is a much bigger change.
