commit ad71110669d2bd8be95225b778498a8268b050f5
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 11 17:48:20 2008 -0700

    - rewrote section on numeric literals (grammar easier to read,
    separate between ints and floats, added language regarding the
    type of numeric literals)
    - added language with respect to the scope of labels
    - introduced ideal types for the purpose of the spec
    - added language to expressions, operands
    - added some more formal language about ideal type conversion
      (probably not 100% correct yet)
