    runtime: fix nanotime for macOS Sierra
    
    In the beta version of the macOS Sierra (10.12) release, the
    gettimeofday system call changed on x86. Previously it always returned
    the time in the AX/DX registers. Now, if AX is returned as 0, it means
    that the system call has stored the values into the memory pointed to by
    the first argument, just as the libc gettimeofday function does. The
    libc function handles both cases, and we need to do so as well.
    
    Fixes #16272.
