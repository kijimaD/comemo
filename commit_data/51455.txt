+  Because the compiler's type checker was replaced in its entirety to
+  support generics, some error messages now may use different wording
+  than before. In some cases, pre-Go 1.18 error messages provided more
+  detail or were phrased in a more helpful way.
+  We intend to address these cases in Go 1.19.

 <p> <!-- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49569 -->
   Because of changes in the compiler related to supporting generics, the
   Go 1.18 compile speed can be roughly 15% slower than the Go 1.17 compile speed.
