    cmd/compile: preserve statements better in expandCalls
    
    Arg/Load/Dereference rewriting was not using the best Pos for
    translated values.  I also investigated whether OpCopy processing
    was losing statements, and though they flood the debugging output,
    doing the "obvious" thing of moving statement marks from copi-er to
    copy-ee actually makes the resulting binary score slightly worse on
    statement-boundary measures.
    (for -N -l, 0.9994 vs 0.9995 from "nostmt -c sqle.test")
    
    Fixes #47793.
