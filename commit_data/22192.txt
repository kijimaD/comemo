    cmd/internal/obj: make ppc64's CR subregisters print as CRn rather than Cn
    
    These 8 registers are windows into the CR register. They are officially CR0
    through CR7 and that is what the assembler accepts, but for some reason
    they have always printed as C0 through C7. Fix the naming and printing.
