    regexp: fix slice bounds out of range panics
    
    Regular expressions involving a (x){0} term are
    simplified by removing this term from the
    expression, just before the expression is compiled.
    
    The number of subexpressions is evaluated before
    the simplification. The number of capture instructions
    in the compiled expressions is not necessarily in line
    with the number of subexpressions.
    
    When the ReplaceAll(String) methods are used, a number
    of capture slots (nmatch) is evaluated as 2*(s+1)
    (s being the number of subexpressions).
    
    In some case, it can be higher than the number of capture
    instructions evaluated at compile time, resulting in a
    panic when the internal slices of regexp.machine
    are resized to this value.
    
    Fixed by capping the number of capture slots to the number
    of capture instructions.
    
    I must say I do not really see the benefits of setting
    nmatch lower than re.prog.NumCap using this 2*(s+1) formula,
    so perhaps this can be further simplified.
