    cmd/link: only exclude C-only symbols on darwin
    
    C-only symbols are excluded from pclntab because of a quirk of darwin,
    where functions are referred to by an exported symbol so dynamic
    relocations de-duplicate to the host binary module and break unwinding.
    
    This doesn't happen on ELF systems because the linker always refers to
    unexported module-local symbols, so we don't need this condition.
    And the current logic for excluding some functions breaks the module
    verification code in moduledataverify1. So disable this for plugins
    on linux.
    
    (In 1.9, it will probably be necessary to introduce a module-local
    symbol reference system on darwin to fix a different bug, so all of
    this onlycsymbol code made be short-lived.)
    
    With this CL, the tests in CL 35116 pass.
