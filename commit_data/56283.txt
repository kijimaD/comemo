    cmd/link: use uint32 as symbol index
    
    Currently, a symbol's global index, the Sym type, is defined as an
    int, which is 64-bit on 64-bit machines. We're unlikely to have
    more than 4 billion symbols in the near future. Even if we will,
    we will probably hit some other limit (e.g. section size) before
    the symbol number limit. Use a 32-bit type to reduce memory usage.
    
    E,g, linking cmd/compile in external linking mode (on macOS/amd64)
    
    Munmap_GC    43.2M ± 0%     35.5M ± 1%   -17.74%  (p=0.000 n=16+20)
    
    This brings the memory usage back before the previous CL, and even
    lower.
