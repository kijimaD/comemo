    os: don't check for TTY before calling splice
    
    I think I confused myself in CL 476335. The TTY check did fix the
    problem with os.Stdout, but it was still possible to get the same
    problem in other ways. I fixed that by making the splice call blocking,
    but it turns out that doing that is enough to fix the TTY problem also.
    So we can just remove the TTY check.
    
    Fixes #59041
