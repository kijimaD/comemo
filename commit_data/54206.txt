    runtime/coverage: apis to emit counter data under user control
    
    Add hooks/apis to support writing of coverage counter data and
    meta-data under user control (from within an executing "-cover"
    binary), so as to provide a way to obtain coverage data from programs
    that do not terminate. This patch also adds a hook for clearing the
    coverage counter data for a running program, something that can be
    helpful when the intent is to capture coverage info from a specific
    window of program execution.
    
    Updates #51430.
