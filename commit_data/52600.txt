commit 1dfe994fe9e87e17b141a3f06c6a88632821020a
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    spec: use Unicode terminology consistently
    
    - refer to character "categories" rather than "classes" per the
      definitions in the Unicode standard
    - use "uppercase", "lowercase" (one word) instead of "upper case"
      or "upper-case", matching the spelling in the Unicode standard
    - clarify that that the blank character "_" is considered a lowercase
      letter for Go's purposes (export of identifiers)
    
    Fixes #44715.
