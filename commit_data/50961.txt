    math/bits: note that functions here may be compiler intrinsics
    
    It was noted in the go1.9 release notes that functions in math/bits
    may be implemented by compiler intrinsics, but this never made it to
    the documentation.
    
    This change adapts the wording of the release notes and puts it in the
    documentation for math/bits.
