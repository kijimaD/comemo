    os: fix plan9 build
    
    I broke it with the darwin getwd attrlist stuff (0583e9d36dd).
    plan9 doesn't have syscall.ENOTSUP.
    
    It's in api/go1.txt as a symbol always available (not context-specific):
    
    pkg syscall, const ENOTSUP Errno
    
    ... but plan9 isn't considered by cmd/api, so it only looks
    universally available.  Alternatively, we could add a fake ENOTSUP
    to plan9, but they were making efforts earlier to clean their
    syscall package, so I'd prefer not to dump more in it.
