    misc/cgo/test: make issue5548 test pickier
    
    If there is doubt about passing arguments correctly
    (as there is in this test), there should be doubt about
    getting the results back intact too. Using 0 and 1
    (especially 0 for success) makes it easy to get a PASS
    accidentally when the return value is not actually
    being propagated. Use less common values.
