    strings: clarify Replacer's replacement order
    
    NewReplacer's documentation says that "replacements are performed in
    order", meaning that substrings are replaced in the order they appear
    in the target string, and not that the old->new replacements are
    applied in the order they're passed to NewReplacer.
    
    Rephrase the doc to make this clearer.
    
    Fixes #25071
