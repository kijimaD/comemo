    encoding/xml: simplify slice-growing logic in rawToken
    
    It appears that old code (from 2009) in xml.(*Decoder).rawToken
    replicates append's slice-growing functionality by allocating a new,
    bigger backing array and then calling copy.
    
    Simplifying the code by replacing it with a single append call does
    not seem to hurt performance:
    
    name         old time/op    new time/op    delta
    Marshal-4      11.2µs ± 1%    11.3µs ±10%    ~     (p=0.069 n=19+17)
    Unmarshal-4    28.6µs ± 1%    28.4µs ± 1%  -0.60%  (p=0.000 n=20+18)
    
    name         old alloc/op   new alloc/op   delta
    Marshal-4      5.78kB ± 0%    5.78kB ± 0%    ~     (all equal)
    Unmarshal-4    8.61kB ± 0%    8.27kB ± 0%  -3.90%  (p=0.000 n=20+20)
    
    name         old allocs/op  new allocs/op  delta
    Marshal-4        23.0 ± 0%      23.0 ± 0%    ~     (all equal)
    Unmarshal-4       189 ± 0%       190 ± 0%  +0.53%  (p=0.000 n=20+20)
