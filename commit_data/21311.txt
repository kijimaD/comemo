    runtime: fix brk_ signature for plan9
    
    with uintptr, the check for < 0 will never succeed in mem_plan9.go's
    sbrk() because the brk_ syscall returns -1 on failure. fixes the plan9/amd64 build.
    
    this failed on plan9/amd64 because of the attempt to allocate 136GB in mallocinit(),
    which failed. it was just by chance that on plan9/386 allocations never failed.
