    cmd/distpack: use positive list of tools to keep
    
    Previously, distpack filtered out tools from the packaged distribution
    using a list of tools to remove. Instead follow mpratt's suggestion on
    CL 666755 and instead filter out tools that are not on a list of tools
    to keep. This will make it easier to tell which tools are actually in
    the distribution.
    
    For #71867
