    cmd/link: don't mark a symbol's GoType reachable when -linkshared
    
    In CL 231397, we stopped marking symbols' GoType reachable in
    general, but not when -linkshared. It was left as a TODO. This CL
    addresses it.
    
    The problem was that the type names are mangled in the shared
    library, so we need to mangle the name consistently in the
    executable as well (regardless of whether the symbol is reachable
    or not), so that the GCProg generation code can find the
    corresponding symbol from the shared library.
