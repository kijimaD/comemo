    cmd/go: make "finding" logging deterministic
    
    In CL 204777, I made the "finding" messages in cachingRepo only print
    after a “longish” delay, on the theory that they would help diagnose
    slow or stuck fetches.
    
    However, as I've been testing Go 1.14 beta 1, I've found that these
    messages are mostly just noise, and the fact that they are so
    nondeterministic causes both confusion and test flakes (#35539).
    
    Moreover, it currently triggers once for each candidate module, when
    what we're usually after is actually a specific package within the
    module.
    
    So let's log the package operation unconditionally instead of the
    module fetches nondeterministically.
    
    Fixes #35539
    Updates #26152
