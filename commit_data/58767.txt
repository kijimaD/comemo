    runtime: clear mspan.largeType more carefully in the case of arenas
    
    The pointer stored in mspan.largeType is an invalid pointer when
    the span is an arena. We need to make sure that pointer isn't seen
    by the garbage collector, as it might barf on it. Make sure we
    zero the pointer using a uintptr write so the old value isn't picked
    up by the write barrier.
    
    The mspan.largeType field itself is in a NotInHeap struct, so a heap
    scan won't find it. The only way we find it is when writing it, or
    when reading it and putting it in a GC-reachable location. I think we
    might need to audit the runtime to make sure these pointers aren't
    being passed in places where the GC might (non-conservatively) scan a
    stack frame it lives in. (It might be ok, many such places are either
    systemstack or nosplit.)
