    filepath: Abs must always return a clean path
    
    When I was first coding Abs, I wondered if people wouldn't
    expect the path to be consistently clean, even if the path
    passed in was already absolute.
    
    CL 4524078 has a potential problem based on exactly that
    assumption, so it feels like this behavior is indeed the
    most useful and least surprising.
