    runtime: Fix GDB integration with Python 2
    
    A similar fix was applied in 545686857bc4c2e7a5306d97e5ef48f631d277bc
    but another instance of 'pc' was missed.
    
    Also adds a test for the goroutine gdb command.
    
    It currently uses goroutine 2 for the test, since goroutine 1 has
    its stack pointer set to 0 for some reason.
