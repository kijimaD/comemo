    cmd/compile/internal/gc: improve comparison with constant strings
    
    Currently we expand comparison with small constant strings into len check
    and a sequence of byte comparisons. Generate 16/32/64-bit comparisons,
    instead of bytewise on 386 and amd64. Also increase limits on what is
    considered small constant string.
    Shaves ~30kb (0.5%) from go executable.
    
    This also updates test/prove.go to keep test case valid.
