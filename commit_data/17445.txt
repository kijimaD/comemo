    crypto/x509: expose arbitary X.509 extensions.
    
    This change allows people who want to parse or set odd X.509 extensions
    to do so without having to add support for them all to the package.
    
    I tried to make it so that only a single member: Extensions would be
    needed. However, that would mean detecting when the caller had altered
    the contents of it so that parsing and marshaling a certificate
    wouldn't ignore all changes to the other members. This ended up being
    messy, thus the current design where there are two members: one for
    reading and another for writing.
    
    As crypto/x509 adds support for more extensions in the future, the raw
    extensions will still be in Extensions for older code that expects it
    there. Also, future extensions will be overridden by any raw extensions
    added to ExtraExtensions by code that was written before support was
    added.
