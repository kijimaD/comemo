    cmd/internal/objfile: align the load address of ELF binary
    
    The ELF ABI just requires that the address and the offset of a
    segment are congruent modulo the alignment, but does not require
    the start address to be aligned. While usually the segment's
    start address is aligned, apparently the zig linker generates
    binary with unaligned address.
    
    At the run time, the memory mapping that contains the segment
    starts at an aligned address (rounding down). Use the aligned
    address for the load address, which matches the mapping.
    Apparently this is what the pprof library expects.
    
    Fixes #59466.
