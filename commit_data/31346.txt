    cmd/compile: Show arch/os when something in TestAssembly fails
    
    It is not always obvious from the first glance when looking at
    TestAssembly failure in which context the code was generated. For
    example x86 and x86-64 are similar, and those of us who do not work with
    assembly every day can even take s390x version as something similar to x86.
    
    So when something fails lets print the whole test context - this
    includes os and arch which were previously missing. An example failure:
    
    before:
    
    --- FAIL: TestAssembly (40.48s)
            asm_test.go:46: expected:       MOVWZ   \(.*\),
                    go:
                    import "encoding/binary"
                    func f(b []byte) uint32 {
                            return binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(b)
                    }
    
                    asm:"".f t=1 size=160 args=0x20 locals=0x0
                    ...
    
    after:
    
    --- FAIL: TestAssembly (40.43s)
            asm_test.go:46: linux/s390x: expected:  MOVWZ   \(.*\),
                    go:
                    import "encoding/binary"
                    func f(b []byte) uint32 {
                            return binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(b)
                    }
    
                    asm:"".f t=1 size=160 args=0x20 locals=0x0
