    cmd/go, testing: indicate when no tests are run
    
    For example, testing the current directory:
    
            $ go test -run XXX
            testing: warning: no tests to run
            PASS
            ok      testing 0.013s
            $
    
    And in a summary:
    
            $ go test -run XXX testing
            ok      testing 0.013s [no tests to run]
            $
    
    These make it easy to spot when the -run regexp hasn't matched anything
    or there are no tests. Previously the message was printed in the "current directory"
    case when there were no tests at all, but not for no matches, and either way
    was not surfaced in the directory list summary form.
    
    Fixes #15211.
