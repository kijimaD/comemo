            description:
            go spec: Base comparison compatibility on assignment compatibility.
    
            Specifically:
            - Simplified definition of comparison compatibility and folded into
              section on comparison operators since it's only used there.
    
            This is a small language change/cleanup. As a consequence:
            - An interface value may now be compared against a non-interface value.
            - Channels with opposite directions cannot be compared directly anymore
              (per discussion with rsc).

    but never implemented.
    
    Fixes #1070.
