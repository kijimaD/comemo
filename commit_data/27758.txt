    cmd/compile/internal/gc: minor Cgen_checknil cleanup
    
    Most architectures can only generate nil checks when the
    the address to check is in a register. Currently only
    amd64 and 386 can generate checks for addresses that
    reside in memory. This is unlikely to change so the architecture
    check has been inverted.
