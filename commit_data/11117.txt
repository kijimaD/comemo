    html/template: reenable testcases and fix mis-escaped sequences.
    
    Tighter octal parsing broke some tests and were disabled in
    https://golang.org/cl/5530051
    
    Those tests were broken.  The CSS decoder was supposed to see CSS
    hex escape sequences of the form '\' <hex>+, but those escape
    sequences were instead being consumed by the template parser.
    
    This change properly escapes those escape sequences, and uses
    proper escaping for NULs.
