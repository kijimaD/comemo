    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile/internal/ssa: eliminate phis during deadcode removal
    
    While investigating the differences between 19710 (remove
    tautological controls) and 12960 (bounds and nil propagation)
    I observed that part of the wins of 19710 come from missed
    opportunities for deadcode elimination due to phis.
    See for example runtime.stackcacherelease. 19710 happens much
    later than 12960 and has more chances to eliminate bounds.
    
    Size of pkg/tool/linux_amd64/* excluding compile:
    
    -this -12960 95882248
    +this -12960 95880120
    -this +12960 95581512
    +this +12960 95555224
    
    This change saves about 25k.
