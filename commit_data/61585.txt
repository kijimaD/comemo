    crypto/internal/fips/aes/gcm: add SealWithRandomNonce
    
    We don't expose it as an AEAD yet because the logic for that is complex
    due to overlap issues. For #69981 we will make a cipher.AEAD wrapper
    outside the FIPS module, but maybe a v2 interface will make it easier,
    and then we'll be able to use this method more directly.
    
    Updates #69981
    For #69536
