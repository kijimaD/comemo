    runtime: minimize time between lockextra/unlockextra
    
    This doesn't fix a bug, but may improve performance in programs that
    have many concurrent calls from C to Go.  The old code made several
    system calls between lockextra and unlockextra.  That could be happening
    while another thread is spinning acquiring lockextra.  This changes the
    code to not make any system calls while holding the lock.
