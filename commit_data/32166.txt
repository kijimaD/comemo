    test: add missing escape analysis test
    
    https://golang.org/cl/37508 added an escape analysis test for #12397 to
    escape2.go but missed to add it to escape2n.go. The comment at the top
    of the former states that the latter should contain all the same tests
    and the tests only differ in using -N to compile. Conform to this by
    adding the function issue12397 to escape2n.go as well.
    
    Also fix a whitespace difference in escape2.go, so the two files match
    exactly (except for the comment at the top).
