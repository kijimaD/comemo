    runtime: avoid using STW GC mechanism for checkmarks mode
    
    Currently, checkmarks mode uses the full STW GC infrastructure to
    perform mark checking. We're about to remove that infrastructure and,
    furthermore, since checkmarks is about doing the simplest thing
    possible to check concurrent GC, it's valuable for it to be simpler.
    
    Hence, this CL makes checkmarks even simpler by making it non-parallel
    and divorcing it from the STW GC infrastructure (including the
    gchelper mechanism).
    
    Updates #26903. This is preparation for unifying STW GC and concurrent
    GC.
