    io: update ByteScanner and RuneScanner docs to match long-standing implementations
    
    Do not require the byte or rune unread by the call to match the last
    return from ReadByte or ReadRune, since in practice the
    implementations of these methods (especially ReadByte) may also unread
    bytes from other Read-style methods without reporting an error.
    
    Explicitly allow the Seek-like behavior implemented by bytes.Reader
    and bufio.Reader, which can “unread” bytes that were never actually
    read.
    
    Explicitly allow ReadByte or ReadRune to return an error after a call
    to a non-ReadByte or non-ReadRune operation respectively.
    (In practice, implementations today allow very liberal calls to
    ReadByte and tend to be more strict about ReadRune, but it seems
    simpler to keep the two definitions completely parallel.)
    
    Like CL 349054, this is techincally a breaking change, but given the
    long-standing behavior of the implementations in the Go standard
    library (such as strings.Reader, bytes.Buffer, and bufio.Reader),
    I believe it falls under the “specification errors” exception to the
    Go 1 compatibility policy.
    
    Fixes #48449
