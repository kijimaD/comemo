    net: correct docs of KeepAlive field in Dialer type
    
    KeepAlive field used to report the wording "keep-alive period"
    which may be misleading. This field does not represent the whole
    TCP keepalive time, that is the inactivity period upon which one
    endpoint starts probing the other end. But it acctually specifies
    the keepalive interval, that is the time between two keepalive
    probes.
    
    Fixes #29089
