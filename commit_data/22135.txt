    net/http: ignore the Unix epoch time in ServeContent
    
    ServeContent ignored zero time.Time{} values when generating
    Last-Modified response headers and checking If-Modified-Since request
    headers. Do the same for a time.Time representing the Unix epoch zero
    value, as this is a common bogus value. Callers who really want to
    send that value (incredibly unlikely) can add a nanosecond to it and
    it will be truncated to second granularity anyway.
    
    Fixes #9842
