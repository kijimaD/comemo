    runtime: replace _MaxMem with maxAlloc
    
    Now that we have memLimit, also having _MaxMem is a bit confusing.
    
    Replace it with maxAlloc, which better conveys what it limits. We also
    define maxAlloc slightly differently: since it's now clear that it
    limits allocation size, we can account for a subtle difference between
    32-bit and 64-bit.
