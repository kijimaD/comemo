    cmd/distpack: remove some tools from packaged distribution
    
    This change removes some tools that are not used for builds, or
    otherwise invoked by the go command (other than through "go tool"
    itself) from the packaged distributions produced by distpack. When these
    tools are missing, "go tool" will build and run them as needed.
    
    Also update a case where we print a buildid commandline to specify
    invoking buildid using "go tool" rather than the binary at it's install
    location, because it may not exist there in packaged distributions
    anymore.
    
    The tools in this CL are the lowest hanging fruit. There are a few more
    tools that aren't used by builds, but we'd have to get the go command to
    run them using "go tool" rather than finding them in the tool install
    directory.
    
    For #71867
