    go/importer: disable TestForCompiler/LookupCustom for GOEXPERIMENT=unified
    
    The TestForCompiler/LookupCustom test tries to read in the export data
    for "math/big", but with a package path of "math/bigger" instead. This
    has historically worked because the export data formats were designed
    to not assume the package's own path, but I expect we can safely
    remove support for this now.
    
    However, since that would be a user-visible change, for now just
    disable the test for GOEXPERIMENT=unified so we can land CL 393715. We
    can revisit whether it's actually safe to break that go/importer use
    case later.
    
    Updates #51734.
