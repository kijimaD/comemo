    net/url: restrict :port checking to [ipv6]:port form
    
    Go 1.4 and earlier accepted mysql://x@y(z:123)/foo
    and I don't see any compelling reason to break that.
    
    The CL during Go 1.5 that broke this syntax was
    trying to fix #11208 and was probably too aggressive.
    I added a test case for #11208 to make sure that stays
    fixed.
    
    Relaxing the check did not re-break #11208 nor did
    it cause any existing test to fail. I added a test for the
    mysql://x@y(z:123)/foo syntax being preserved.
    
    Fixes #12023.
