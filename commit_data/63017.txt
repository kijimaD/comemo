    runtime: improve scan inner loop
    
    On every arch except amd64, it is faster to do x&(x-1) than x^(1<<n).
    
    Most archs need 3 instructions for the latter: MOV $1, R; SLL n, R;
    ANDN R, x. Maybe 4 if there's no ANDN.
    
    Most archs need only 2 instructions to do x&(x-1). It takes 3 on
    x86/amd64 because NEG only works in place.
    
    Only amd64 can do x^(1<<n) in a single instruction.
    (We could on 386 also, but that's currently not implemented.)
