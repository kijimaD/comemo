    cmd/compile/internal/types2: break cycles in invalid types
    
    This CL reverses the change in CL 284254 (which was ported
    to types2) which originated in CL 240901 to address a crash
    in a test created by a fuzzer (that crash appears to be
    avoided in other ways, now).
    
    This exposed another bug in typeset.go where we don't look
    for the underlying type when testing if a type is an interface
    or not. Fixed that as well.
    
    Adjusted a test case that now doesn't report an error anymore
    (which is good).
    
    Fixes #48819.
