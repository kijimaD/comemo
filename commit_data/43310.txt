    test: make runindir tests pass regardless of whether module mode is in use
    
    The "runindir" tests used "go run", but relied on relative imports
    (which are not supported by "go run" in module mode). Instead, such
    tests must use fully-qualified imports, which require either a go.mod
    file (in module mode) or that the package be in an appropriate
    subdirectory of GOPATH/src (in GOPATH mode).
    
    To set up such a directory, we use yet another copy of the same
    overlayDir function currently found in the misc subdirectory of this
    repository.
    
    Fixes #33912
    Updates #30228
