    go/types: import instance.expand and subst.go from dev.go2go
    
    Changes from dev.go2go:
     + A potentially latent bug is fixed when nilling out tparams in an
       instantiated signature (the resulting type could be Typ[Invalid])
     + Support for pointer designation is removed
     + instantiatedHash is updated to use '[]' rather than '()'
     + Several TODOs were added for me to follow-up on, rather than address
       in this CL
     + Error callsites are updated. Deciding on error codes and better error
       messages is punted to a later CL
    
    These changes can be reviewed by comparing with Patchset #1 of this CL.
