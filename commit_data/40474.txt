    testing: panic on calls to Short/Verbose before Parse
    
    CL 121936 added this diagnostic to avoid a panic accessing *short.
    (Hence the "This shouldn't really be a panic" comment.)
    
    That CL was right to produce a clearer error than a plain memory fault,
    but I think wrong to print+exit instead of panicking. I just ran into
    one of these in a real program, and there is no indication anywhere
    of how the program reached this point. The panic will show that.
    So change print+exit to a panic with a helpful message, in contrast
    to the original panic with an unhelpful message and the current
    helpful message without stack trace.
