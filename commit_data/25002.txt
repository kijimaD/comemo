    debug/dwarf: add test for split DWARF
    
    This adds a test that debug/dwarf can read the skeleton DWARF data
    from a split DWARF image (though it doesn't currently support piecing
    the external DWARF data back together). This should work because
    there's nothing particularly different about skeleton DWARF data, but
    previously failed because of poor handling of unrecognized attributes.
    
    Updates #12592.
