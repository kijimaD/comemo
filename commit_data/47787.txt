    cmd/compile: fix case where we didn't delay transformAssign in varDecl
    
    We delay all transformations on generic functions, and only do them on
    instantiated functions, for several reasons, of which one is that
    otherwise the compiler won't understand the relationship between
    constrained type parameters. In an instantiation with shape arguments,
    the underlying relationship between the type arguments are clear and
    don't lead to compiler errors.
    
    This issue is because I missed delaying assignment transformations for
    variable declarations. So, we were trying to transform an assignment,
    and the compiler doesn't understand the relationship between the T and U
    type parameters.
    
    The fix is to delay assignment transformations for variable declarations
    of generic functions, just as we do already for normal assignment
    statements.
    
    A work-around for this issue would be to just separate the assignment
    from the variable declaration in the generic function (for this case of
    an assignment involving both of the constrained type parameters).
    
    Fixes #50147
