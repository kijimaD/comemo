    log/slog: Reorder doc comment for level constants
    
    pkgsite and go doc print the doc comment *after* the code, resulting in:
    
        const (
                LevelDebug Level = -4
                ...
        )
    
        Many paragraphs...
    
        Names for common levels.
    
    The "Names for common levels." feels out of place and confusing at the bottom.
    
    This is also consistent with the recommendation for the first sentence in doc comments to be the "summary".
