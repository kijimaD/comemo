    internal/coverage: add apis for reading/writing counter data
    
    Add utilities for reading and writing of counter data files as part of
    the new code coverage implementation.
    
    Trivia note: currently the contents of counter data files are emitted
    in little-endian form, which for the counters is somewhat painful in
    that we need to visit each counter value and properly encode it. It
    might be better to instead emit counters in native endianity and then
    teach the tools to decode properly in the case of an endianity
    mismatch.
    
    Updates #51430.
