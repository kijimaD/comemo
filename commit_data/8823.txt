    syscall: add tty support to StartProcess
    
    These changes add a Ctty int field to the Unix syscall.ProcAttr which,
    if set >= 0 in conjuction with Setsid=true, will be used by
    forkAndExecInChild as the file descriptor for the new child's
    controlling terminal.
    
    Necessary changes have been made to mkerrors.sh to generate defs for
    TIOC*, though changes to its output files are not included here.
    The changes made should support Linux, FreeBSD and Darwin, at least.
