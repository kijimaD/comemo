    net/http/fcgi: remove locking added to prevent a test-only race
    
    The race reported in issue #41167 was detected only because the
    ReadWriter used in test code happened to be a bytes.Buffer whose
    Read and Write operate (unsafely) on shared state. This is not the
    case in any realistic scenario where the FastCGI protocol is spoken
    over sockets or pairs of pipes.
    
    Since tests that use nopWriteCloser don't care about any output
    generate by child.Serve(), we change nopWriteCloser to provide
    a dummy Write method.
    
    Remove the locking added in CL 252417, since it causes a deadlock
    during write as reported in #43901. The race in tests no longer
    happens thanks to the aforementioned change to nopWriteCloser.
    
    Fixes #43901.
    Updates #41167.
