    go/doc/comment: do not turn ``` into “`
    
    ``` is Markdown, not Go doc comment, but some small fraction of users get confused.
    
    In a set of 55M Go doc comments drawn from the latest version of
    all public Go modules known to the module proxy in spring 2020,
    the current Go 1.19 gofmt reformats about 1.57M of them.
    Out of those 1.57M comments, 8k of them (about 0.5%) contain ```.
    
    Instead of rewriting ``` to “`, leave it alone.
    
    For #51082.
