    httputil: move dump and chunking functions out of http
    
    This moves DumpRequest, DumpResponse, NewChunkedReader,
    and NewChunkedWriter out of http, as part of the continued
    http diet plan.
    
    Also, adds DumpRequestOut (for dumping outbound requests),
    since DumpRequest's ambiguity (the "wire representation" in
    what direction?) was often a source of confusion and bug
    reports.
