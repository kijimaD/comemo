    cmd/compile: reorganise and improve ssa/README.md
    
    Since the initial version was written, I've gotten help writing
    cmd/compile/README.md and I've also learned some more on my own, so it's
    time to organise this document better and expand it.
    
    First, split up the document in sections, starting from the simplest
    ideas that can be explained on their own. From there, build all the way
    up into SSA functions and how they are compiled.
    
    Each of the sections also gets more detail now; most ideas that were a
    paragraph are now a section with several paragraphs. No new major
    sections have been added in this CL.
    
    While at it, add a copyright notice and make better use of markdown,
    just like in the other README.md.
    
    Also fix a file path in value.go, which I noticed to be stale while
    reading godocs to write the document.
    
    Finally, leave a few TODO comments for areas that would benefit from
    extra input from people familiar with the SSA package. They will be
    taken care of in future CLs.
