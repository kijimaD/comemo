    cmd/go: accept plain file for .vcs (instead of directory)
    
    Sometimes .git is a plain file; maybe others will follow.
    This CL matches CL 21430, made in x/tools/go/vcs.
    
    The change in the Swift test case makes the test case
    pass by changing the test to match current behavior,
    which I assume is better than the reverse.
    (The test only runs locally and without -short, so the
    builders are not seeing this particular failure.)
    
    For #10322.
