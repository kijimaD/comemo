    html/template: adjust ambiguous URL context text
    
    Before: ... appears in an ambiguous URL context.
    After:  ... appears in an ambiguous context within a URL.
    
    It's a minor point, but it's confused multiple people.
    Try to make clearer that the ambiguity is "where exactly inside the URL?"
    
    Fixes #17319.
