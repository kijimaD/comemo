    runtime: add missing trace lock edges
    
    We're missing lock edges to trace.lock that happen only rarely. Any
    trace event can potentially fill up a trace buffer and acquire
    trace.lock in order to flush the buffer, but this happens relatively
    rarely, so we simply haven't seen some of these lock edges that could
    happen.
    
    With this change, we promote "fin, notifyList < traceStackTab" to
    "fin, notifyList < trace" and now everything that emits trace events
    with a P enters the tracer lock ranks via "trace", rather than some
    things entering at "trace" and others at "traceStackTab".
    
    This was found by inspecting the rank graph for things that didn't
    make sense.
    
    Ideally we would add a mayAcquire annotation that any trace event can
    potentially acquire trace.lock, but there are actually cases that
    violate this ranking right now. This is #53979. The chance of a lock
    cycle is extremely low given the number of conditions that have to
    happen simultaneously.
    
    For #53789.
