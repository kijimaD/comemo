    net/http: change conn.curReq type to atomic.Pointer[response]
    
    Use the newly added atomic.Pointer[T] type for atomically
    loading and storing type *T pointers. This has the advantage of
    avoiding runtime type assertions required by its predecessor,
    atomic.Value.
    
    To fix build failures uncovered by TryBots (caused by "panic:
    unaligned 64-bit atomic operation"), also change conn.curState to
    type atomic.Uint64 so that it is 64-bit aligned.
