    crypto/tls: Client side support for TLS session resumption.
    
    Adam (agl@) had already done an initial review of this CL in a branch.
    
    Added ClientSessionState to Config which now allows clients to keep state
    required to resume a TLS session with a server. A client handshake will try
    and use the SessionTicket/MasterSecret in this cached state if the server
    acknowledged resumption.
    
    We also added support to cache ClientSessionState object in Config that will
    be looked up by server remote address during the handshake.
