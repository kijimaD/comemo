    misc/ios: don't override GOCACHE on the device
    
    The iOS exec wrapper copies the environment variables to the binary
    running on the device. However, some variables such as HOME, TMPDIR and
    GOCACHE refer to directories that might not be valid on the device.
    
    The wrapper already ignores HOME and TMPDIR, but after GO111MODULE
    was flipped to on for the standard library, cmd/go tests started
    failing without a valid and writable GOCACHE.
    
    It took a while to reproduce because go test does not set an explicit
    GOCACHE but cmd/dist test does.
    
    Fixes #30914
