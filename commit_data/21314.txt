    crypto/x509: Authority Key Identifier must be included in all CRLs issued
    
    According to RFC5280 the authority key identifier extension MUST included in all
    CRLs issued. This patch includes the authority key identifier extension when the
    Subject Key Identifier is present in the signing certificate.
    
    RFC5280 states:
    
    "The authority key identifier extension provides a means of identifying the
    public key corresponding to the private key used to sign a CRL.  The
    identification can be based on either the key identifier (the subject key
    identifier in the CRL signer's certificate) or the issuer name and serial
    number.  This extension is especially useful where an issuer has more than one
    signing key, either due to multiple concurrent key pairs or due to changeover."
    
    Conforming CRL issuers MUST use the key identifier method, and MUST include this
    extension in all CRLs issued."
