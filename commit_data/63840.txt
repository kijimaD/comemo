@@ -9,6 +9,13 @@ The compiler in Go 1.23 can now overlap the stack frame slots of local variables
 accessed in disjoint regions of a function, which reduces stack usage
 for Go applications.
 
+<!-- https://go.dev/cl/577935 -->
+For 386 and amd64, the compiler will use information from PGO to align certain
+hot blocks in loops.  This improves performance an additional 1-1.5% at
+a cost of an additional 0.1% text and binary size.  This is currently only implemented
+on 386 and amd64 because it has not shown an improvement on other platforms.
+Hot block alignment can be disabled with `-gcflags=[<packages>=]-d=alignhot=0`
