    cmd/internal/sys: allow unaligned loads on big-endian ppc64
    
    According to https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements, we've required
    power8 since Go 1.9.
    
    Before that, we supported power5 which couldn't do unaligned loads.
    But power8 should be able to (it does for ppc64le).
    
    In fact, I think we already support unaligned loads in some cases,
    for instance cmd/compile/internal/ssa/config.go lists big-endian ppc64
    as having unaligned loads.
