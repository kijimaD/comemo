    [dev.boringcrypto] misc/boring: add go1.12.1b4 and update build scripts
    
    The inliner seems to have gotten a bit too smart in 1.12 and it made
    sha1.boringNewSHA1 disappear. Replace it with the proper
    crypto/internal/boring/sig.BoringCrypto signature. Also, switch the
    negative signature to sha256.(*digest), since SHA-256 is used for sure
    by cmd/go. Not using crypto/internal/boring/sig.StandardCrypto just to
    be safe, in case the crypto/internal/boring/sig mechanism breaks.
    
    Also, had to fight #30833 and #30515 to get
    golang.org/x/build/cmd/release to build in modules mode.
