    cmd/go: ignore '@' when cleaning local and absolute file path args
    
    Since CL 194600, search.CleanPaths preserves characters after '@' in
    each argument. This was done so that paths could be cleaned while
    version queries were preserved. However, local and absolute file paths
    may contain '@' characters.
    
    With this change, '@' is treated as a normal character by
    search.CleanPaths in local and absolute paths.
    
    Fixes #35115
