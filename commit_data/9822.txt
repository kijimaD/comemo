    go: documentation for new command

    This command, go, will replace both gomake/make and goinstall.
    Make will stick around only for building our C commands
    and perhaps package runtime.
    
    In normal use while developing you'd run commands like
    
            go compile
            go test
            go clean
            go install
    
    which apply to the package in the current directory.
    
    To operate on code written by others, you add an explicit
    package path:
    
            go get gopath.googlecode.com/hg/oauth
            go test gopath.googlecode.com/hg/oauth
    
    The script.txt file is a script showing the output of
    the various help commands that the command has.
    (Right now, all the command can do is print help messages.)
