    runtime: remove unnecessary atomics from heapBitSetType
    
    These used to be necessary when racing with updates to the mark bit,
    but since the mark bit is no longer in the bitmap and the checkmark is
    only updated with the world stopped, we can now always use regular
    writes to update the type information in the heap bitmap.
    
    Somewhat surprisingly, this has basically no overall performance
    effect beyond the usual noise, but it does clean up the code.
