    [dev.ssa] test: remove extra tests from non-SSA builds
    
    non-SSA backends are all over the map as to whether nil checks
    get removed or not.  amd64, 386, 386/387, arm are all subtly different.
    Remove these extra checks for now, they are in nilptr3_ssa.go so they
    won't get lost.
