    go/parser, go/types: report invalid else branch in if statements
    
    - Only accept valid if statement syntax in go/parser.
    
    - Check AST again in go/types since it may have been modified and the
      AST doesn't preclude other statements in the else branch of an if
      statement.
    
    - Removed a test from gofmt which verified that old-style if statements
      permitting any statement in the else branch were correctly reformatted.
      It's been years since we switched to the current syntax; no need to
      support this anymore.
    
    - Added a comment to go/printer.
    
    Fixes #13475.
