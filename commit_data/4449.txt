+<h2 id="Design">Discuss your design</h2>

+<p>
+The project welcomes submissions but please let everyone know what
+you're working on if you want it to become part of the main repository.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Before undertaking to write something new for the Go project, send
+mail to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts">mailing
+list</a> to discuss what you plan to do.  This gives everyone a
+chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort,
+and ensures that the idea fits inside the goals for the language
+and tools.  It also guarantees that the design is sound before code
+is written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level
+discussions.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+In short, send mail before you code.
+And don't start the discussion by mailing a change list!
