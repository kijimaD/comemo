    cmd/compile: simplify some declarations
    
    Reduce the scope of some. Also remove vars that were simply the index or
    the value in a range statement. While at it, remove a var that was
    exactly the length of a slice.
    
    Also replaced 'bad' with a more clear 'errored' of type bool, and
    renamed a single-char name with a comment to a name that is
    self-explanatory.
    
    And removed a few unnecessary Index calls within loops.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp on std cmd.
