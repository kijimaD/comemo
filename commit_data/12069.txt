 "... when a template author writes an HTML tag in a safe templating language,
 the browser will interpret the corresponding portion of the output as a tag
 regardless of the values of untrusted data, and similarly for other structures
 such as attribute boundaries and JS and CSS string boundaries."

 "A developer (or code reviewer) familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, who
