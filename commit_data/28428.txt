    cmd/go: document testdata directory in "go help test"
    
    Document the correct use of the testdata directory
    where test writers might be expecting to find it.
    
    It seems that alldocs.go was out of date, so it
    has picked up some other changes with this commit.
    
    Fixes #14715.
