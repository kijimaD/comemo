    cmd/link, cmd/internal/dwarf: add DWARF5 line table support
    
    This patch rolls out the necessary changes to migrate the DWARF line
    table support in the compiler and linker to DWARF version 5, gated by
    the "dwarf5" GOEXPERIMENT.
    
    DWARF version 5 includes a number of changes to the line table,
    notably a revamped prolog section and a change in the indexing system
    used to refer to files and directories within the line table
    program. Specifically, prior to DWARF 4 a compilation's directory
    table was considered to have an implicit zero entry containing the
    compilation directory of the translation unit (package), and the file
    table was considered to have an implicit zero entry storing the
    "primary source file" (stored in the compilation unit DIE name).
    DWARF 5 does away with these implicity entries meaning that files and
    dirs are now effectively a 0-based index.
    
    Updates #26379.
