    cmd/go: introduce the GOVERSION env variable
    
    This is an extra variable available via 'go env', but not read from the
    user's environment. It corresponds to the same string that
    runtime.Version returns, assuming a program is built by the same version
    of Go.
    
    It's similar to the output of 'go version', but without the "go version"
    prefix nor the "$GOOS/$GOARCH" suffix.
    
    The main use case here is tools, which often use 'go env' to query basic
    information about the installed Go tree. Its version was one missing
    piece of information, which required an extra call to 'go version'
    before this change.
    
    Fixes #41116.
