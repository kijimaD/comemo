    go/printer, gofmt: fix multi-line logic
    
    A node spans multiple lines if the line difference
    between start and end point is > 0 (rather than > 1).
    Fixes some odd cases introduced by CL 5706055;
    pointed out by dsymonds.
    
    Added corresponding test case. The other change
    in the .golden file reverts to the status before
    the CL mentioned above and is correct.
    
    gofmt -w src misc changes godoc.go back to where
    it was before the CL mentioned above.
    
    Fixes #3304.
