+<pre>
+This release includes some package changes that require changes to client code.
+
+The flate, gzip and zlib's NewWriterXxx functions no longer return an error.
+The compiler will flag all affected code which must then be updated by hand.
+
+The os package's Exec and Time functions were removed. Callers should use the
+os/exec package and time.Now instead. The ShellExpand function was renamed to
+ExpandEnv. The NewFile function now takes a uintptr.
+
+The runtime package's Type type and its methods have been removed.
+Use the reflect package instead.
