    cmd/dist: remove stale cleanup code
    
    dist clean has logic to delete command binaries from the cmd
    directories in cleanlist. However, these days the only binary it could
    possibly remove is "$GOROOT/src/cmd/cgo/cgo". This is clearly no
    longer necessary, so remove this stale code.
    
    When this logic was originally introduced in CL 5622058, it was driven
    by cleantab (not cleanlist), which contained all of the cmd
    directories, which were legion at the time because this was the era of
    the [568][acgl] toolchain. CL 9154 deleted cleantab, and did the same
    clean walk over the "cmd/" directories listed in buildorder. However,
    buildorder was a list of packages necessary to build cmd/go, so the
    only "cmd/" directory in buildorder at the time was "cmd/go". Hence,
    at that CL, dist started deleting only a "$GOROOT/src/cmd/go/go"
    binary. The modern cleanlist was introduced in CL 76021, as a list of
    packages containing "generated files and commands". The only "cmd/"
    directory in cleanlist the whole time has been "cmd/cgo" (and I'm
    honestly not sure why cmd/cgo is in there), so since that CL dist has
    only deleted "$GOROOT/src/cmd/cgo/cgo".
