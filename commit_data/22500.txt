    runtime: run concurrent mark phase on regular stack
    
    Currently, the GC's concurrent mark phase runs on the system
    stack. There's no need to do this, and running it this way ties up the
    entire M and P running the GC by preventing the scheduler from
    preempting the GC even during concurrent mark.
    
    Fix this by running concurrent mark on the regular G stack. It's still
    non-preemptible because we also set preemptoff around the whole GC
    process, but this moves us closer to making it preemptible.
