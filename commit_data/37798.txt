    bytes: note that NewBuffer's initial size can change
    
    bytes.NewBuffer's documentation says it can be used to set the initial
    size of the buffer. The current wording is:
    
    > It can also be used to size the internal buffer for writing.
    
    This may led users to believe that the buffer (its backing array) is
    fixed in size and won't grow, which isn't true (subsequent Write calls
    will expand the backing array as needed).
    
    Change the doc to make it clearer that NewBuffer just sets the initial
    size of the buffer.
    
    Fixes #27242
