commit 4e308d73ba3610838305997b6f4793c4f4dcfc4e
Author: Daniel Martí <mvdan@mvdan.cc>

    cmd/go: refer to the right package in a test
    
    The test checks that two packages aren't non-test dependencies.
    There's a copy-paste typo, however.
    When net/http is unexpectedly found as a dependendency,
    we instead mention the other package in the error message.
