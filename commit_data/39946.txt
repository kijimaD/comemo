    debug/dwarf: expose CU byte order
    
    Currently, dwarf.Reader exposes the current compilation unit's address
    size, but doesn't expose its byte order. Both are important for
    decoding many attributes. For example, location descriptions include
    addresses that are encoded in native form for the CU.
    
    This CL exposes the byte order of the compilation unit in the same way
    we already expose its address size, which makes it possible to decode
    attributes containing native addresses.
