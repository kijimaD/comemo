    runtime: zero pointer-looking scalararg values
    
    I have a CL which at every gc looks through data and bss
    sections for nonpointer data (according to gc maps) that
    looks like a pointer.  These are potential missing roots.
    
    The only thing it finds are begnign, storing stack pointers
    into m0.scalararg[1] and never cleaning them up.  Let's
    clean them up now so the test CL passes all.bash cleanly.
    
    The test CL can't be checked in because we might store
    pointer-looking things in nonpointer data by accident.
