    cmd/go: fix go list -test where C is a dependency.
    
    Currently go list -test runtime/cgo fails with an index out of range
    error. This appears to be because the updating of import paths that
    happens as part of -test doesn't take into account the fact that the
    Internal.Imports of a package do not contain "C", whereas the public
    Imports do.
    
    Therefore we skip the public Import of "C" if it exists and continue.
