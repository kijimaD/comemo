    doc: mention the scratch repo
    
    If people are interested in contributing to Go, but not sure what
    change they'd like to make just yet, we can point them to the scratch
    repo, so they can go through the process of submitting and merging
    something now, and make more useful contributions later.
    
    My evidence that sending people to the scratch repo would encourage
    future contributions is that a number of people who went through the
    workshop at Gophercon have continued to send CL's after submitting to
    the scratch repo, even though I doubt they planned to before going
    through the workshop.
