    runtime: consolidate gcResetGState calls
    
    Currently gcResetGState is called by func gcscan_m for concurrent GC
    and directly by func gc for STW GC. Simplify this by consolidating
    these two calls in to one call by func gc above where it splits for
    concurrent and STW GC.
    
    As a consequence, gcResetGState and gcResetMarkState are always called
    together, so the next commit will consolidate these.
