    internal/bytealg: fix bug in index function for ppc64le/power9
    
    The index function was not handling certain corner cases where there
    were two more bytes to be examined in the tail end of the string to
    complete the comparison. Fix code to ensure that when the string has
    to be shifted two more times the correct bytes are examined.
    Also hoisted vsplat to V10 so that all paths use the correct value.
    Some comments had incorrect register names and corrected the same.
    Added the strings that were failing to strings test for verification.
    
    Fixes #56457
