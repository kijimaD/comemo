    go/types: fix Info.Implicits entries
    
    Packages of dot imports don't appear in the Info.Implicits map
    since they are already taken care of by the Info.Defs map. Fix
    documentation.
    
    Implicitly dot-imported objects of a package shouldn't appear
    in the Info.Implicits map because the documentation never said
    so and there's no way to map multiple objects to the same
    *ast.ImportSpec with the current data structure.
    
    Added missing test for Info.Implicits.
    
    The fix is a trivial one-line deletion, the rest is documentation
    and test.
    
    Fixes #21591.
