    wiki article: remove "flag" import from the code
    
    When reading along the article, the extra code added in the final
    version is not explained. The main function calls flag.Parse(), for
    example, which will cause an error, unless the readers looks at the
    entirety of final.go to see the import added.
    
    The file shown to the users no longer has the extra flags. The testing
    code is now in a patch that gets applied to final.go in order to create
    final-test.go. This is the file that will be used to test the code,
    matching final.go as much as possible.
