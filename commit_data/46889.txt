    debug/buildinfo: new package with Read and ReadFile
    
    These functions provide access to module information stamped into Go
    binaries. In the future, they'll provide access to other information
    (like VCS info).
    
    These functions are added in a new package instead of runtime/debug
    since they use binary parsing packages like debug/elf, which would
    make runtime/debug an unacceptably heavy dependency. The types in
    runtime/debug are still used; debug/buildinfo uses them via type
    aliases.
    
    This information is already available for the running binary through
    debug.ReadBuildInfo and for other binaries with 'go version -m', but
    until now, there hasn't been a way to get it for other binaries
    without installing cmd/go.
    
    This change copies most of the code in cmd/go/internal/version. A
    later CL will migrate 'go version -m' to use this package.
    
    For #37475
    Fixes #39301
