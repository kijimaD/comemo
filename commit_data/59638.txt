    net/http: speed up go test
    
    Optimize the execution speed of go test ./net/http from ~38s to ~28s.
    This is achieved by shortening the sleep interval utilized for
    identifying goroutine leaks.
    
    This optimization is motivated by noticing significant periods of
    inactivity in the -trace output. Even after applying this CL, many
    Off-CPU wait periods seem to remain:
    
    $ go test ./net/http
    ok      net/http        27.744s
    
    real    0m28.204s
    user    0m4.991s
    sys     0m1.797s
