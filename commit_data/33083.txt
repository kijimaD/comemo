    cmd/link: suppress unnecessary DWARF relocs that confuse dsymutil
    
    During Mach-O linking, dsymutil takes the DWARF from individual object
    files and combines it into a debug archive. Because it's content-aware,
    it doesn't need our help to do its job. Nonetheless, it does try to
    honor relocations that are present in its input.
    
    When dsymutil encounters a relocation, it uses the value of that
    relocation as an index into the debug map to find its final location.
    When it does that, it's assuming that the value is an address in the
    object file. But DWARF references are section-relative. So when it
    processes a relocation for a DWARF reference, it gets confused,
    and if the value happens to match the address of a function or
    data symbol, it will rewrite it incorrectly.
    
    Since the relocations don't help, and can hurt, drop them when
    externally linking a Mach-O binary.
    
    Fixes #22068
