    doc: remove paragraph break for upgrading to modules
    
    Previously, the release notes broke up the sentences that modules
    is now ready for production use and where to file issues for
    migration problems into separate paragraphs. This made it look like
    the migration paragraph was about upgrading to 1.14, not to modules,
    and made the reading a bit confusing. Now the entire idea is in one
    paragraph.
