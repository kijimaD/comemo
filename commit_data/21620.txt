    [dev.cc] cmd/new5a etc, cmd/internal/asm: initial C → Go conversion
    
    This is the raw output of c2go. It needs fixes to make it compile.
    Rather than make c2go do a 100% conversion (like we're doing for
    liblink and the Go compilers), since this is so trivial I'm going to
    make the remaining changes by hand in a followup CL.
    This CL makes the next CL's diffs useful.
    
    Also copy unmodified .y files (5a/a.y → new5a/a.y and so on)
    
    The converted 6a/lex.c has been written to new6a/lex.go
    but also to internal/asm/asm.go, because I'm going to factor
    out some common code rather than convert it four times.
