    runtime: make (Un)LockOSThread doc more prescriptive
    
    Right now users have to infer why they would want LockOSThread and
    when it may or may not be appropriate to call UnlockOSThread. This
    requires some understanding of Go's internal thread pool
    implementation, which is unfortunate.
    
    Improve the situation by making the documentation on these functions
    more prescriptive so users can figure out when to use them even if
    they don't know about the scheduler.
