    net/http/httptest: close client connections in separate goroutines
    
    The existing implementation sequentially closes connection in the loop
    and until the previous client connections is not closed the next one
    would not be processed. Instead, the algorithm modified to spawn the
    function that closes single connection in a standalone goroutine, thus
    making at least a try to close it.
