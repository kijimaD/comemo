    net: fix TestDialTimeout on windows builder
    
    I don't know what's out there, but something
    is answering to 127.0.71.111:80 on our builder,
    so use a different port.
    
    Also insert a check that the dial fails, which
    would have diagnosed this problem.
    
    Fixes #3016.
