    cmd/dist: revise skip sequence added in CL 452763
    
    Revise the code added in CL 452763 that skips some of the -race tests
    on older windows builders. The old-style skip was doing a log.Printf,
    which wound up being interpreted in "-list" mode. Fix is to pass in a
    special rtPreFunc when registering the test (thanks Austin for the
    fix suggestion).
    
    Updates #56904.
