commit 76ab626bfc52fad9ce8c12fac56177ce68ff744b
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    runtime: factor common code out of defs_windows_*.go
    
    Also give up on the fiction that these files can be regenerated.
    They contain many manual edits, and they're fairly small anyway.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
