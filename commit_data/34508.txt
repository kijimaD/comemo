    cmd/go: skip TestVetWithOnlyCgoFiles when cgo is disabled
    
    CL 99175 added TestVetWithOnlyCgoFiles. However, this
    test is failing on platforms where cgo is disabled,
    because no file can be built.
    
    This change fixes TestVetWithOnlyCgoFiles by skipping
    this test when cgo is disabled.
    
    Fixes #24304.
