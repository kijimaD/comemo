    net/http: send more cookie values in double quotes
    
    According to RFC 6255 a cookie value may contain neither spaces " "
    nor commas ",". But browsers seem to handle these pretty well and such
    values are not uncommon in the wild so we do allow spaces and commas
    in cookie values too. Up to now we use the double-quoted wire format
    only for cookie values with leading and/or trailing spaces and commas.
    Values with internal spaces/commas are sent without the optional double
    quotes. This seems to be a problem for some agents.
    
    This CL changes the behaviour for cookie values with spaces or commas:
    Such values are always sent in double quotes. This should not have
    any impact on existing agents and the increases of data transmitted
    is negligible.
    
    Fixes #18627
