    os: disable the use of netpoll on regular files on *BSDs.
    
    The kqueue based netpoller always registers file descriptors with EVFILT_READ and EVFILT_WRITE.
    However only EVFILT_READ notification is supported for regular files.
    On FreeBSD a regular file is always reported as ready for writing, resulting in a busy wait.
    On Darwin, Dragonfly, NetBSD and OpenBSD, a regular file is reported as ready for both reading and writing only once.
