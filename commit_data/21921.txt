    cmd/5g, cmd/6g, cmd/8g, cmd/9g: use a register to zero in componentgen
    
    Using a zero register results in shorter, faster code.
    5g already did this. Bring 6g, 8g, and 9g up to speed.
    Reduces godoc binary size by 0.29% using 6g.
    
    This CL includes cosmetic changes to 5g and 8g.
    With those cosmetic changes included, componentgen is now
    character-for-character equivalent across the four architectures.
