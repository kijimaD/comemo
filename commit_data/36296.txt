    all: update stale test skips
    
    Issues #10043, #15405, and #22660 appear to have been fixed, and
    whatever tests I could run locally do succeed, so remove the skips.
    
    Issue #7237 was closed in favor of #17906, so update its skip line.
    
    Issue #7634 was closed as it had not appeared for over three years.
    Re-enable it for now. An issue should be open if the test starts being
    skipped again.
