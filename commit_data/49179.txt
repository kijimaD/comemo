    cmd/go: make TestScript/test_fuzz_minimize_dirty_cov use less memory
    
    The test doesn't need to be as aggressive, it _should_ still tickle
    the right paths with high enough probability. This should
    significantly reduce the memory it consumes, which is at a premium
    when testing fuzzing things.
    
    Fixes #52744
