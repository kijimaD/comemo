    test/codegen: remove plan9/amd64 specific array zeroing/copying tests
    
    The compiler previously avoided the use of MOVUPS on plan9/amd64. This
    was changed in CL 655875, however the codegen tests were not updated
    and now fail (seemingly the full codegen tests do not run anywhere,
    not even on the longtest builders).
