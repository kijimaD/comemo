    cmd/internal/gc: improve "type *X has no field or method M" message
    
    Try to provide hints for common areas, either *interface
    were interface would have been better, and note incorrect
    capitalization (but don't be more ambitious than that, at
    least not today).
    
    Added code and test for cases
    
      ptrInterface.ExistingMethod
      ptrInterface.unexportedMethod
      ptrInterface.MissingMethod
      ptrInterface.withwRongcASEdMethod
      interface.withwRongcASEdMethod
      ptrStruct.withwRongcASEdMethod
      struct.withwRongcASEdMethod
    
    also included tests for related errors to check for
    unintentional changes and consistent wording.
    
    Somewhat simplified from previous versions to avoid second-
    guessing user errors, yet also biased to point out most-likely
    root cause.
    
    Fixes #10700
