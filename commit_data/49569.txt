    spec: retitle section on "Assignments" to "Assignment statements"
    
    This permits a clear distinction between an individual assignment
    and an assignment statement which may assign more than one value.
    It also makes this section title consistent with all other section
    titles about statements. Adjust internal links and prose where
    appropriate. (Note that the spec already referred to assignment
    statements in a couple of places, even before this change.)
    
    Add an introductory paragraph to the section on assignment statements.
    
    Preparation for adding a section on value vs reference types
    (issue #5083).
