    cmd/compile: fix wrong check for b.Controls in isBlockMultiValueExit
    
    b.Controls has type [2]*Value, thus len(b.Controls) > 0 is always true.
    The right check should be b.Controls[0] != nil, though, this is also
    always true, since when we always set control value for BlockRet and
    BlockRetJmp when state.exit is called.
    
    Though checkFunc also checks for nil control value of ret/retjmp, but
    it happens later after expand_calls pass, so better to be defensive
    here, just in case.
