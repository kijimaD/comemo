    [dev.link] cmd/link: use string map for name lookup
    
    As we no longer include static symbols into the name lookup table,
    it is basically just two maps, one for ABI0, one for ABIInternal.
    Just use two maps instead. It may be slightly faster to use
    string-keyed maps than struct-keyed maps (still need performance
    data to confirm).
    
    For now, allow external symbols being referenced by name, as
    external objects don't use index.
