    runtime: skip TestSegv/SegvInCgo failures with "runtime: unknown pc"
    
    This test has failed on four different builders in the past month.
    Moreover, because every Go program depends on "runtime", it is likely
    to be run any time a user runs 'go test all' in their own program.
    
    Since the test is known to be flaky, let's skip it to avoid
    introducing testing noise until someone has time to investigate. It
    seems like we have enough samples in the builder logs to at least
    start with.
    
    For #50979
