    cmd/compile: do not use content addressable symbol for generic iface method names
    
    When a generic interface method is used, we use a special
    relocation R_USEGENERICIFACEMETHOD to tell the linker the name of
    the generic interface method, so it can keep methods with that
    name live. The relocation references a symbol whose content is the
    name. Currently this is a string symbol, which is content
    addessable and may have trailing zero bytes (for better
    deduplication). The trailing bytes can cause confusion for the
    linker. This symbol doesn't need to be in the final binary and
    doesn't need to be deduplicated with other symbol. So we don't use
    content addressable symbol but make an (unnamed) symbol
    specifically for this.
    
    May fix #54346.
