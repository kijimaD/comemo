commit 76cc0a271286b7facfd5233d56737a3d92dd9670

    net/http: in Client, consume small redirect bodies before making next request
    
    In Go 1.2, closing a request body without reading to EOF
    causes the underlying TCP connection to not be reused. This
    client code following redirects was never updated when that
    happened.
    
    This was part of a previous CL but moved to its own CL at
    Josh's request.  Now with test too.
