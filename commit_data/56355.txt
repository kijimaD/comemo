    syscall: reroute SYS_IOCTL and SYS_SYSCTL on openbsd
    
    OpenBSD 7.5 no longer supports indirect syscalls. A number of Go
    packages make use of syscall.Syscall with SYS_IOCTL or SYS_SYSCTL,
    since neither is well supported by golang.org/x/sys/unix. Reroute
    calls with either of these system call numbers to the respective
    libc stub so that they continue to work.
    
    Updates #63900
