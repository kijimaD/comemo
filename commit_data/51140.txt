    cmd/compile: let compiler downgrade its own concurrency
    
    This gets the Go command out of the business of thinking it understands
    compiler debug flags, and allows the compiler to turn down its worker
    concurrency instead of failing and forcing the user to do the very
    same thing.  Debug flags that are obviously safe for concurrency
    (at least to me) are tagged; probably there's more.
