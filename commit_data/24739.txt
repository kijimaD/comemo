    runtime: remove GC start up/shutdown workaround in mallocgc
    
    Currently mallocgc detects if the GC is in a state where it can't
    assist, but also can't allocate uncontrolled and yields to help out
    the GC. This was a workaround for periods when we were trying to
    schedule the GC coordinator. It is no longer necessary because there
    is no GC coordinator and malloc can always assist with any GC
    transitions that are necessary.
    
    Updates #11970.
