    cmd/dist: convert host tests to use goTest
    
    This adds support for host tests to goTest and registerTest and
    modifies all uses of registerHostTest to use goTest and registerTest.
    
    This eliminates the last case where go test command lines are
    constructed by hand. Next we'll clean up all of the infrastructure
    support for that.
    
    I traced all exec calls from cmd/dist on linux/amd64 and this makes
    only no-op changes (such as re-arranging the order of flags).
    
    Preparation for #37486.
