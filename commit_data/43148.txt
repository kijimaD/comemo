    [dev.link] cmd/link: remove unnecessary file processing from writelines
    
    The linker DWARF-gen's line table writing routine contains a loop that
    walks all abstract function DIEs looking for files that aren't
    referenced in concrete function DIEs. Turns out this loop is no longer
    necessary, most likely because the compiler emits an explicit DWARF
    file table into the object file.
    
    This patch removes the offending loop. This is a prelude to some
    additional work that will hopefully get rid of file renumbering in
    writelines altogether (still WIP).
