    syscall: add aix to syscall_unix_test.go
    
    This file was forgotten during the port of aix/ppc64. In order to make
    its tests passed, a few things were added:
    - Add termios.h to zerrors
    - Add AF_LOCAL = AF_UNIX as this constant doesn't exits natively on AIX
    - Fix the alignment in cmsghdr structure.
    
    TestPassFD doesn't work on AIX TL<2 because getsockname isn't working as
    expected with unix socket.
