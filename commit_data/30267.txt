    expvar: add benchmarks for steady-state Map Add calls
    
    Add a benchmark for setting a String value, which we may
    want to treat differently from Int or Float due to the need to support
    Add methods for the latter.
    
    Update tests to use only the exported API instead of making (fragile)
    assumptions about unexported fields.
    
    The existing Map benchmarks construct a new Map for each iteration, which
    focuses the benchmark results on the initial allocation costs for the
    Map and its entries. This change adds variants of the benchmarks which
    use a long-lived map in order to measure steady-state performance for
    Map updates on existing keys.
    
    Updates #18177
