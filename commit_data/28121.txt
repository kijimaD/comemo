    [dev.garbage] runtime: revive sweep fast path
    
    sweep used to skip mcental.freeSpan (and its locking) if it didn't
    find any new free objects. We lost that optimization when the
    freed-object counting changed in dad83f7 to count total free objects
    instead of newly freed objects.
    
    The previous commit brings back counting of newly freed objects, so we
    can easily revive this optimization by checking that count (like we
    used to) instead of the total free objects count.
