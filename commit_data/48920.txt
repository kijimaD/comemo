    crypto/elliptic: use generics for nistec-based curves
    
    There was no way to use an interface because the methods on the Point
    types return concrete Point values, as they should.
    
    A couple somewhat minor annoyances:
    
        - Allocations went up due to #48849. This is fine here, where
          math/big causes allocations anyway, but would probably not be fine
          in nistec itself.
    
        - Carrying the newPoint/newGenerator functions around as a field is
          a little weird, even if type-safe. It also means we have to make
          what were functions methods so they can access newPoint to return
          the zero value. This is #35966.
    
    For #52182
