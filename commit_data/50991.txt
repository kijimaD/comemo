    cmd/compile: special packages must not have any path separators
    
    We want to distinguish special compiler-generated package paths,
    like go.shape, from user paths, like go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv.
    The former have no slash in them.
    
    Writing a test for this seems hard, as the dependency we'd need to
    add would be non-hermetic. (Or it would need a new tricky run.go mode.)
    
    This CL does fix the example in the issue.
    
    Fixes #49606
