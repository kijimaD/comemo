    cmd/go: make vcstest repo scripts compatible with old Mercurial versions
    
    The scripts added in CL 421455 passed on the TryBots, but failed on
    the "-stretch" builders, which supply Mercurial 4.0
    (released 2016-11-01).
    
    Debian 9 “Stretch” has been at end-of-life since June 30, 2022, but
    until we can turn down the outdated builders (#56414) we should keep
    them passing tests.
    
    For #27494.
    Updates #56414.
