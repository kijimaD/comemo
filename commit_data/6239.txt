commit 0aa2317096fde91c51a279b885765b5e26359150
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    arm: work around reg allocator bug in 5g, in two parts.
    1) hack regalloc to leave R9 (m) and R10 (g) alone.
    the real fix is tricker, but this gets us running
    2) fix up the few places in the package sources that
    the shortage of registers affects, by simplifying
    some expressions.
    
    all of this should be reverted when the right fix is in.
    
    Fixes #1084.
