    log: add flag LUTC, to use UTC time zone for time stamp
    
    Issue 9483 suggests several approaches to correlating logs from
    machines in different time zones. This approach is the simplest and
    really should be sufficient: provide a way to clamp the time stamps
    to UTC.
    
    Fixes #9483.
