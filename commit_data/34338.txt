    debug/dwarf: clarify StructField.ByteSize doc
    
    StructField.ByteSize is almost always unset; document that Type.Size()
    is the place to look.
    
    The dwarf package doesn't spend much effort teaching you DWARF, so I
    don't know what level of handholding is appropriate. Still, no harm in a
    little comment.
    
    Closes #21093
