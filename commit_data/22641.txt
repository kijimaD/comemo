    misc/ios: retry loop to handle builder flakiness
    
    After moving the darwin/arm builder to new hardware several new flaky
    error messages appeared. This provided enough information to Google
    to make it clear that iOS build systems have been flaky for many
    years, and that is unlikely to change any time soon.
    
    However, all of the pain of lldb and using a breakpoint early in
    program initialization gives us an advantage: all install and
    initialization flakiness appears to happen before the Go program ever
    gets going. So if we see an error or we timeout before we reach our
    breakpoint (before any test code has executed), we can assume it is
    the fault of the builder and restart without risking hiding a flaky
    Go test.
    
    This code has successfully processed the last 8 builds. I am hopeful.
