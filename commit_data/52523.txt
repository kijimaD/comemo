    net/http: drop client address comparison in TestTransportRemovesDeadIdleConnections
    
    Since the first client connection is explicitly closed before making
    the second request, we cannot in general assume that the second
    request uses a different port (it is equally valid to open the new
    connection on the same port as the old one that was closed).
    
    Fixes #59438.
