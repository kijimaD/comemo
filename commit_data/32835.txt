    cmd/compile: merge bytes inline test with the rest
    
    In golang.org/cl/42813, a test was added in the bytes package to check
    if a Buffer method was being inlined, using 'go tool nm'.
    
    Now that we have a compiler test that verifies that certain funcs are
    inlineable, merge it there. Knowing whether the funcs are inlineable is
    also more reliable than whether or not their symbol appears in the
    binary, too. For example, under some circumstances, inlineable funcs
    can't be inlined, such as if closures are used.
    
    While at it, add a few more bytes.Buffer methods that are currently
    inlined and should clearly stay that way.
    
    Updates #21851.
