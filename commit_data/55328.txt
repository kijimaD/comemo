    internal/poll: don't queue port completion entry for udp on windows
    
    This CL sets the FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS notification mode
    for all udp and tcp networks.
    
    When SetFileCompletionNotificationModes was implemented, back in
    go 1.2 [1], it was not possible to enable this mode on udp connections
    because it is buggy on Windows 7 and earlier. The bug was fixed on
    Windows 8. We can safely enable this mode now, since go 1.21
    will require Windows 10 or higher.
    
    While here, I noticed that this mode is only enabled for tcp, but not
    for tcp4 nor tcp6. I don't think this restriction makes sense, so I'm
    lifting it.
    
    The performance gains are relevant:
    
    name                           old time/op    new time/op    delta
    ReadWriteMsgUDPAddrPort-12       13.3µs ± 4%    11.2µs ± 8%  -15.90%  (p=0.000 n=10+9)
    WriteToReadFromUDP-12            14.5µs ±18%    11.4µs ± 4%  -21.35%  (p=0.000 n=10+9)
    WriteToReadFromUDPAddrPort-12    13.4µs ± 3%    11.0µs ± 2%  -18.00%  (p=0.000 n=10+9)
