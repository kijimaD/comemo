    cmd/go: don't generate output for "go build -o /dev/null x.go"
    
    We look for "-o /dev/null", and, if found, pretend that there was no
    "-o" option and don't generate an action to create the final executable.
    
    We look for "go build x.go", and, if found, and if -o was not used,
    pretend that the user specified "-o x".
    
    Unfortunately, we were doing those in the wrong order, so that "go
    build -o /dev/null x.go" would first clear the "-o" option and then
    set it to "-o x".
    
    This CL flips the order so that the right thing happens.
    
    Fixes #25579
