    cmd/go: run gofmt from current GOROOT
    
    The existing implementation executes `gofmt` binary from PATH
    environment variable on invocation `go fmt` command.
    Relying on PATH might lead to confusions for users with several Go installations.
    It's more appropriate to run `gofmt` from GOBIN (if defined) or GOROOT.
    
    Fixes #10755
