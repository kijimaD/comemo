    net/http/pprof: use Request.Context, not the deprecated CloseNotifier
    
    Prior to this commit, the profiling code had a sleep() function that
    waits and unblocks on either time.After() or a channel provided by an
    http.CloseNotifier derived from a supplied http.ResponseWriter.
    
    According to the documentation, http.CloseNotifier is deprecated:
    
      Deprecated: the CloseNotifier interface predates Go's context package.
      New code should use Request.Context instead.
    
    This patch does just that -- sleep() now takes an *http.Request and uses
    http.Request.Context() to signal when a request has been cancelled.
