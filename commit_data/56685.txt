    cmd/compile/internal/typecheck: remove base.Errorf from Assignop
    
    The documentation for Assignop specifies that if the assignment is not
    valid, the reason for the failure is returned via a reason string
    without failing the build.
    
    A few cases in Assignop1 -> implements -> ifacelookdot directly call
    base.Errorf rather than plumbing through the reason string as they
    should. Drop these calls. Since error messages are mostly unreachable
    here (it only applies to generated code), don't maintain them and allow
    them to just fallthrough to the generic "missing method" message.
    
    This is important for PGO specialization, which opportunistically checks
    if candidate interface call targets implement the interface. Many of
    these will fail, which should not break the build.
    
    For #59959.
