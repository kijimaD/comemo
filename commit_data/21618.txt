    [dev.cc] cmd/dist: write cmd/internal/obj/zbootstrap.go
    
    cmd/internal/obj needs information about the default
    values of GOROOT, GOARM, GOEXPERIMENT, Version, and so on.
    It cannot ask package runtime, because during bootstrap
    package runtime comes from Go 1.4.
    So it must have its own copy.
