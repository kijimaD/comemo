    cmd/5g: fix register opt bug
    
    The width was not being set on the address, which meant
    that the optimizer could not find variables that overlapped
    with it and mark them as having had their address taken.
    This let to the compiler believing variables had been set
    but never used and then optimizing away the set.
    
    Fixes #4129.
