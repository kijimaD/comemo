commit 52f0afe0dbf123f0b81bf358b6427c09bb96a597

    exp/locale/collate: Added skeleton for the higher-level types to provide
    context for change lists of lower-level types. The public APIs are defined
    in builder.go and collate.go. Type table is the glue between the lower and
    higher level code and might be a good starting point for understanding the
    collation code.
