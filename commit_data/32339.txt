    runtime: avoid zeroing hmap fields in makemap twice
    
    Stack allocated hmap structs are explicitly zeroed before being
    passed by pointer to makemap.
    
    Heap allocated hmap structs are created with newobject
    which also zeroes on allocation.
    
    Therefore, setting the hmap fields to 0 or nil is redundant
    since they will have been zeroed when hmap was allocated.
