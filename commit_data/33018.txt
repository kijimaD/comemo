    runtime: fix cgo export of panicmem on ios
    
    CL 68490 reworked the way the panicmem function is exposed to the
    C mach expection catcher. However, //go:cgo_export_static isn't enough:
    the underlying assembly functions must not start with the middle dot.
    
    Without the middle dot, the panicmem function's exported name is
    not prefixed with its package; rename it to xx_cgo_panicmem to decrease
    the chance of a symbol name clash.
    
    Finally, mark the overridden C symbol weak to avoid duplicate symbol
    errors from the host linker.
    
    For the ios builders.
