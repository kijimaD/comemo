    runtime: clean up power-of-two rounding code with align functions
    
    This change renames the "round" function to the more appropriately named
    "alignUp" which rounds an integer up to the next multiple of a power of
    two.
    
    This change also adds the alignDown function, which is almost like
    alignUp but rounds down to the previous multiple of a power of two.
    
    With these two functions, we also go and replace manual rounding code
    with it where we can.
