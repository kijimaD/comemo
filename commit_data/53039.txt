    net/http: do not force the Content-Length header if nilled
    
    According to the ResponseWriter documentation:
    
      To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
      their value to nil.
    
    In some cases, this documentation is incorrect: chunkWriter writes
    a Content-Length header even if the value was set to nil. Meaning
    there is no way to suppress this header.
    
    This patch replaces the empty string comparison with a call to
    `header.has` which takes into account nil values as expected.
    This is similar to the way we handle the "Date" header.
