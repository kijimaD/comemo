    cmd/dist: skip compiling 100 packages without benchmarks in race mode
    
    The go_test_bench:* tests run:
    
        go test -short -race -run=^$ -benchtime=.1s -cpu=4 $PKG
    
    ... on each discovered package with any tests. (The same set used for
    the "go_test:*" tests)
    
    That set was 168 packages:
    
    $ go tool dist test -list | grep go_test: | wc -l
    168
    
    But only 76 of those have a "func Benchmark", and running each
    "go_test_bench:" test and compiling it in race mode, just to do
    nothing took 1-2 seconds each.
    
    So stop doing that and filter out the useless packages earlier. Now:
    
    $ go tool dist test -list -race | grep go_test_bench:  | wc -l
    76
    
    Should save 90-180 seconds. (or maybe 45 seconds for trybots, since
    they're sharded)
