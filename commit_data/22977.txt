    net: relax error checking in TestAcceptIgnoreSomeErrors
    
    TestAcceptIgnoreSomeErrors was created to test that network
    accept function ignores some errors. But conditions created
    by the test also affects network reads. Change the test to
    ignore these read errors when acceptable.
    
    Fixes #10785
