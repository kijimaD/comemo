commit 42aa608f8acd50f963b0f1807a6c3ecbf651b6e2

    cmd/compile: remove confusing comment, fix comment for symExport
    
    The symExport flag tells whether a symbol is in the export list
    already or not (and it's also used to avoid being added to that
    list). Exporting is based on that export list - no need to check
    again.
