    [dev.link] cmd/link: don't write text address directly if using plugins
    
    When using plugins, on darwin we do weird things with
    runtime.etext symbol, assigning a value for it, then clear it,
    reassign a different value. This breaks the logic of writing text
    address directly.
    
    I think we should remove the weird thing with runtime.etext, if
    possible. But for now, disable the optimization (this is not a
    common case anyway).
    
    Fix darwin-nocgo build.
