    spec: remove need for separate Function production (cleanup)
    
    The EBNF production
    
            Function = Signature FunctionBody .
    
    was used in FunctionDecl, MethodDecl, and FunctionLit, but only
    for the latter it shortened the syntax slightly.
    
    This change "inlines" Function which simplifies FunctionDecl and
    MethodDecl and gets rid of the Function production.
    
    This has no impact on the specified language. Also, the Function
    production is never referred to by the prose, so it's safe to
    remove it from the spec.
    
    Finally, neither go/ast nor go/parser have a representation of
    this production via a corresponding node or parse function, so
    no possibly valuable documentation is lost, either.
