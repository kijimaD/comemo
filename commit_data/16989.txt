    net/url: prepend slash to path in String()
    
    Previously if a path was set manually without a leading /, String()
    would not insert the slash when writing its output. This would lead
    to situations where a URL that should be http://www.google.com/search
    is output as http://www.google.comsearch
    
    Fixes #5927.
