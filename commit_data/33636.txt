    all: remove some unused result params
    
    Most of these are return values that were part of a receiving parameter,
    so they're still accessible.
    
    A few others are not, but those have never had a use.
    
    Found with github.com/mvdan/unparam, after Kevin Burke's suggestion that
    the tool should also warn about unused result parameters.
