    cmd/compile: classify more nodes as "poor choices" for statements
    
    Aggregate-making nodes that are later decomposed
    are poor choices for statements, because the decomposition
    phase turns them into multiple sub-values, some of which may be
    dead.  Better to look elsewhere for a statement mark.
