    os: further document limitations around naked file descriptors
    
    NewFile requires the file descriptor to be either closed
    through the returned File instance, or to stay valid at least
    until the finalizer runs during garbage collection.
    
    These requirements are easily violated when file descriptors
    are closed via unix.Close, or when the *File returned by
    NewFile is garbage collected while the underlying file descriptor is
    still in use.
    
    This commit adds further documentation for NewFile and Fd, making it
    explicit that using naked file descriptors is subject to constraints
    due to garbage collection of File objects.
    
    Fixes #43863
