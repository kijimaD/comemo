    net/http: split Trailers tests into two halves
    
    The old test was in client_test.go but was a mix of four things:
    
    - clients writing trailers
    - servers reading trailers
    - servers writing trailers
    - clients reading trailers
    
    It definitely wasn't just about clients.
    
    This moves it into clientserver_test.go and separates it into two
    halves:
    
    - servers writing trailers + clients reading trailers
    - clients writing trailers + servers reading trailers
    
    Which still isn't ideal, but is much better, and easier to read.
