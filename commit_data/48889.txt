    os: use a lower file count for TestOpenFileLimit on openbsd
    
    OpenBSD has a default soft limit of 512 and hard limit of 1024 - as such,
    attempting to open 1200 files is always going to fail unless the defaults
    have been changed. On this platform use 768 instead such that it passes
    without requiring customisation.
    
    Fixes #51713
