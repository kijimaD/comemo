    net/http: update Response.Trailer doc
    
    I updated this in the previous commit (https://golang.org/cl/17931)
    but noticed a typo. and it still wasn't great.
    
    The Go 1.5 text was too brief to know how to use it:
    
        // Trailer maps trailer keys to values, in the same
        // format as the header.
