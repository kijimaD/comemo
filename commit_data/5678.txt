    misc/vim: reorganize plugin so it uses ftplugin and syntax
    
    This sets up vim to work out of the box with go programs as long as syntax
    highlighting is enabled. Both files must be copied to the vim runtime
    directory in order for the file-type detection and syntax loading to work.
