    spec: remove special int rule for shifts
    
    The rule is not concistently followed by gc.
    It appears that gccgo is ignoring it. go/types
    does not implement this rule. However, both
    gccgo and now go/types can compile/type-check
    the entire std library (and thus all the shift
    expressions occuring in it) w/o errors. For
    more details see the discussion in issue 4883.
    
    Fixes #4880.
