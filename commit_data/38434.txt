    debug/dwarf: more graceful handling of unsupported types
    
    Enhance the type decoder to do a better job handling unknown type
    tags. DWARF has a number of type DIEs that this package doesn't handle
    (things like "pointer to member" types in C++); avoid crashing for
    such types, but instead return a placeholder "UnsupportedType" object
    (this idea suggested by Austin). This provides a compromise between
    implementing the entire kitchen sink and simply returning an error
    outright on any unknown type DIE.
    
    Fixes #29601.
