    cmd/trace: compute pprof-style output per goroutine type
    
    The trace command computes IO, Schedule, Block, and Syscall profiles
    by following the unblocking links in the execution trace and summing
    up the duration.  This change offers variations of those profiles
    that include only selected goroutine types. The id parameter takes the
    goroutine type - i.e. pc of the goroutine.
    
    The output is available from the /goroutine view. So, users can see
    where the goroutines of interest typically block.
    
    Also, these profiles are available for download so users can use
    pprof or other tools to interpret the output. This change adds links
    for download of global profile in the main page.
