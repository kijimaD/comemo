    arm: prop up software floating point
    
    Just enough to make mov instructions work,
    which in turn is enough to make strconv work
    when it avoids any floating point calculations.
    That makes a bunch of other packages pass
    their tests.
    
    Should suffice until hardware floating point
    is available.
    
    Enable package tests that now pass
    (some due to earlier fixes).
    
    Looks like there is a new integer math bug
    exposed in the fmt and json tests.
