    cmd/internal/ld: prevent creation of .dynamic and .dynsym symbols when externally linking
    
    This allows the removal of a fudge in data.go.
    
    We have to defer the calls to adddynlib on non-Darwin until after we have
    decided whether we are externally or internally linking.  The Macho/ELF
    separation could do with some cleaning up, but: code freeze.
    
    Fixing this once rather than per-arch is what inspired the previous CLs.
