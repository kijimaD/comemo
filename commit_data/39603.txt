    cmd/cgo: adjust comment about ignored pragma warnings
    
    The warnings are not strictly tied to FreeBSD but to the clang version.
    People could still be building with an old version of clang even if not
    on FreeBSD. The -Wpragmas and -Waddress-of-packed-member warnings were
    introduced in clang 4.0, so also adjust the comment accordingly.
    
    This was discussed as part of CL 160777 which introduced these comments.
    
    Updates #27619
