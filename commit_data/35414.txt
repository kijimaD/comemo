    cmd/compile: change type of clear argument of ordercopyexpr to bool
    
    ordercopyexpr is only called with 0 or 1 as value for the clear
    argument. The clear variable in ordercopyexpr is only used in the
    call to ordertemp which has a clear argument of type bool.
    
    Change the clear argument of ordercopyexpr from int to bool and change
    calls to ordercopyexpr to use false instead of 0 and true instead of 1.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
