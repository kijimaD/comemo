    runtime: eliminate rendundant loads gcPercent
    
    The previous change was an automated change that made gcPercent a
    type-safe atomic variable. However, that introduced a lot of redundant
    formal atomic loads of the variable. Remove them by only loading once in
    each case, and reusing the value.
