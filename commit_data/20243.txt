    runtime: give nosplit functions 32 more bytes of headroom
    
    The Go calling convention uses more stack space than C.
    On 64-bit systems we've been right up against the limit
    (128 bytes, so only 16 words) and doing awful things to
    our source code to work around it. Instead of continuing
    to do awful things, raise the limit to 160 bytes.
    I am prepared to raise the limit to 192 bytes if necessary,
    but I think this will be enough.
    
    Should fix current link-time stack overflow errors on
            - nacl/arm
            - netbsd/amd64
            - openbsd/amd64
            - solaris/amd64
            - windows/amd64
