    runtime/internal/sys: make Len64 nosplit
    
    CL 427615 causes failures when Len64 can't be inlined. It's unclear to
    me why this wasn't a problem before, but it is used in sensitive
    contexts and therefore really should be marked. Confirmed that the
    failures in question reproduce without this change, and don't reproduce
    with it.
    
    Fixes #55117.
