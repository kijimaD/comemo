    crypto/tls: document that only tickets are supported.
    
    This change clarifies that only ticket-based resumption is supported by
    crypto/tls. It's not clear where to document this for a server,
    although perhaps it's obvious there because there's nowhere to plug in
    the storage that would be needed by SessionID-based resumption.
    
    Fixes #18607
