    runtime: remove VDSO fallback test and benchmarks
    
    These tests assume that it is OK to switch between time implementations,
    but the clock_gettime call uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC and the fallback call,
    gettimeofday, uses CLOCK_REALTIME. Disabling the clock_gettime call means
    that calls to nanotime will start returning very different values.
    This breaks the new timer code, which assumes that nanotime will return
    a consistently increasing value.
    
    This test is not very useful in any case as it doesn't check the results.
    
    Removing this file also removes BenchmarkTimeNow, which is a duplicate
    of BenchmarkNow in the time package.
    
    Updates #27707
    Fixes #32109
