    cmd/compile: avoid an assignment of n.Type in walk
    
    In the future, walk will probably run concurrently
    with SSA construction. It is possible for walk
    to be walking a function node that is referred
    to by another function undergoing SSA construction.
    In that case, this particular assignment to n.Type
    is race-y.
    
    This assignment is also not necessary;
    evconst does not change the type of n.
    Both arguments to evconst must have the same type,
    and at the end of evconst, n is replaced with n.Left.
    
    Remove the assignment, and add a check to ensure
    that its removal remains correct.
    
    Updates #15756
