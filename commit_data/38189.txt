    runtime: eliminate gosweepone
    
    gosweepone just switches to the system stack and calls sweepone.
    sweepone doesn't need to run on the system stack, so this is pretty
    pointless.
    
    Historically, this was necessary because the sweeper was written in C
    and hence needed to run on the system stack. gosweepone was the
    function that Go code (specifically, bgsweep) used to call into the C
    sweeper implementation. This probably became unnecessary in 2014 with
    CL golang.org/cl/167540043, which ported the sweeper to Go.
    
    This CL changes all callers of gosweepone to call sweepone and
    eliminates gosweepone.
