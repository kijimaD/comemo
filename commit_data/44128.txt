    [dev.link] cmd/link/internal/loader: remove Propagate* shim functions
    
    Remove the loader's PropagateSymbolChangesBackToLoader and
    PropagateLoaderChangesToSymbols shim functions. These were used at one
    point to enable conversion of phases in the linker that were
    "downstream" of loadlibfull -- given the current wavefront position
    there's not much point keeping them around.
