    ld: bump pe linker version to 3.0 to allow code signing
    
    The Windows signtool.exe thinks our binaries are 'invalid
    Win32 programs' unless the PE linker version field is 3.0
    or greater.
    
    This minor change makes it possible to successfully sign
    gc-built binaries on Windows.
