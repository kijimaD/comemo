commit 77b3269fb57d2f5c19a76a80f1d215dc801be3b7
Author: Bryan C. Mills <bcmills@google.com>

    cmd/go: in TestScript, set GOTRACEBACK and use SIGQUIT to terminate hung subprocesses
    
    This should produce more useful outputs if a cmd/go invocation hangs
    during a test.
    
    (In some cases the outputs will be very verbose, but verbose is still
    better than uninformative.)
    
    For #36460
    For #38768
