    cmd/compile/internal/types: add Pkg and SetPkg methods to Type
    
    The go/types API exposes what package objects were declared in, which
    includes struct fields, interface methods, and function parameters.
    
    The compiler implicitly tracks these for non-exported identifiers
    (through the Sym's associated Pkg), but exported identifiers always
    use localpkg. To simplify identifying this, add an explicit package
    field to struct, interface, and function types.
