    runtime: don't mark unrolled bitmap type as having a gc program
    
    It doesn't have a GC program - the whole point is that it is
    the unrolled version of a GC program.
    
    Fortunately, this isn't a bug as (*mspan).typePointersOfUnchecked
    ignores the GCProg flag and just uses GCData as a bitmap unconditionally.
