    cmd/cgo/internal/swig,cmd/go: skip swig tests on 386
    
    We recently added a C++ toolchain to the image, and this is causing
    problems on 386 and clang builders. The likely culprit is that we're
    missing 32-bit C++ libraries on the builders.
    
    Even if this theory is wrong, these tests *never* ran (always skipped,
    or truly never ran) on these platforms, so just skip them for now. We
    can look into getting the libraries installed later, but skip for now
    to unblock the builders.
    
    There are also problems with clang, but I believe they'll be resolved by
    setting CXX to clang++ in golangbuild.
    
    For #67698.
