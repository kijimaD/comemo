    syscall: add GidMappingsEnableSetgroups to Linux SysProcAttr
    
    Linux 3.19 made a change in the handling of setgroups and the 'gid_map' file to
    address a security issue.
    The upshot of the 3.19 changes is that in order to update the 'gid_maps' file,
    use of the setgroups() system call in this user namespace must first be disabled
    by writing "deny" to one of the /proc/PID/setgroups files for this namespace.
    
    Also added tests for remapping uid_map and gid_map inside new user
    namespace.
    
    Fixes #10626
