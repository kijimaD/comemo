    time: revert strict parsing of RFC 3339
    
    CL 444277 fixed Time.UnmarshalText and Time.UnmarshalJSON to properly
    unmarshal timestamps according to RFC 3339 instead of according
    to Go's bespoke time syntax that is a superset of RFC 3339.
    
    However, this change seems to have broken an AWS S3 unit test
    that relies on parsing timestamps with single digit hours.
    It is unclear whether S3 emits these timestamps in production or
    whether this is simply a testing artifact that has been cargo culted
    across many code bases. Either way, disable strict parsing for now
    and re-enable later with better GODEBUG support.
