    runtime/debug: make SetGCPercent(-1) wait for concurrent GC
    
    Currently, SetGCPercent(-1) disables GC, but doesn't wait for any
    currently running concurrent GC to finish, so GC can still be running
    when it returns. This is a change in behavior from Go 1.8, probably
    defies user expectations, and can break various runtime tests that
    depend on SetGCPercent(-1) to disable garbage collection in order to
    prevent preemption deadlocks.
    
    Fix this by making SetGCPercent(-1) block until any concurrently
    running GC cycle finishes.
    
    Fixes #22443.
