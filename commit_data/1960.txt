commit 2a9f1ee21532498ceb74a4a7b589ab0cc1b3885f
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Apr 3 16:19:22 2009 -0700

    Daily snapshot.
    - godoc now supports the following url prefixes:
      /doc/ for package documentation
      /file/ for files (directories, html, and .go files)
      /spec for the spec
      /mem for the memory model
    - formatting of comments has been fixed
    - tons of minor cleanups (still more to do)
    
    Still missing:
    - pretty printing of source is not as pretty as it used to be
    (still a relict from the massive AST cleanup which has't quite made it's way everywhere)
    - documentation entries should be sorted
    - comments in code is not printed or not properly printed
