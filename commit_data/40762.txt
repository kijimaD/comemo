    sync: make TestPoolDequeue termination condition more robust
    
    TestPoolDequeue creates P-1 consumer goroutines and 1 producer
    goroutine. Currently, if a consumer goroutine pops the last value from
    the dequeue, it sets a flag that stops all consumers, but the producer
    also periodically pops from the dequeue and doesn't set this flag.
    
    Hence, if the producer were to pop the last element, the consumers
    will continue to run and the test won't terminate. This CL fixes this
    by also setting the termination flag in the producer.
    
    I believe it's impossible for this to happen right now because the
    producer only pops after pushing an element for which j%10==0 and the
    last element is either 999 or 1999999, which means it should never try
    to pop after pushing the last element. However, we shouldn't depend on
    this reasoning.
