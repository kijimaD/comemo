    net/http/httputil: ReverseProxy should pass on unannounced Trailers
    
    Trailers that are not announced in the Trailer must be passed on to
    the downstream client.
    
    Rather than iterate over each and find missing trailer values,
    this re-adds all trailers to the headers if there is a disparity
    between the number of announced trailers and the final number.
    
    This fixes #20437
