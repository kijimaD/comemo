    cmd/compile: fix "width not calculated" ICE
    
    Expanding interface method sets is handled during width calculation,
    which can't be performed concurrently. Make sure that we eagerly
    expand interfaces in the frontend when importing them, even if they're
    not actually used by code, because we might need to generate a type
    description of them.
    
    Fixes #25055.
