    syscall: add mmap test
    
    This CL adds a test that calls Mmap and Munmap through Syscall9
    as the canary that detects assembly fragment breakage. For now
    there is no package test that uses Syscall9 in the standard
    library across all Unix-like systems.
    
    Note that the package runtime owns its assembly fragments, so
    this canary never works for runtime breakage.
