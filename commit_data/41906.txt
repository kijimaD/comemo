    [dev.link] cmd/link: process cgo_import_static before host object loading
    
    In internal linking mode, we need to process cgo_import_static
    directives before loading host objects, because the directive is
    to tell the host object loader how to deal with imported symbols.
    
    This should fix linking with old object files. I think there
    needs some similar logic for new object files, but I'll leave
    that for later.
