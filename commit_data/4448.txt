commit 59a3cae402d648041d766051894c432d73ff89e3
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 16 16:53:56 2009 -0800

    - Parse expressions as opposed to statements for gofmt rewrite patterns.
    Allows stand-alone types (e.g. []int as patterns) and doesn't require
    a semicolon at the end (which are now mandatory terminators).
    
    - Fix a matcher bug.
