    cmd/link: fix plugin on linux/arm64
    
    The init function and runtime.addmoduledata were not added when
    building plugin, which caused the runtime could not find the
    module.
    
    Testplugin is still not enabled on linux/arm64
    (https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/master/src/cmd/dist/test.go#948)
    because the gold linker on the builder is too old, which fails
    with an internal error (see issue #17138). I tested locally and
    it passes.
    
    Fixes #24940.
    Updates #17138.
