commit 9c721aedd572c00d1a91549dda910ce74fe17d44

    cmd/yacc: move cmd/yacc/expr to cmd/yacc/testdata/expr
    
    This will keep the go command from trying to build it
    when the cmd/ tree is no longer a special case.
    
    Also update doc.go to refer to the correct location.
    (It was incorrect even before this CL.)
