    runtime: omit breakpoint during terminal panic
    
    A terminal panic (one that prints a stack trace and exits)
    has been calling runtime.breakpoint before calling exit,
    so that if running under a debugger, the debugger can
    take control.  When not running under a debugger, though,
    this causes an additional SIGTRAP on Unix and pop-up
    dialogs on Windows.
    
    Support for debugging Go programs has gotten good
    enough that we can rely on the debugger to set its own
    breakpoint on runtime.exit if it wants to look around.
