    encoding/csv: forbid certain Comma and Comment runes
    
    The record delimiter (not configurable by user) is "\r\n" or "\n".
    It is insensible for the user to set Comma or Comment delimiters
    to be some character that conflicts with the record delimiter.
    Furthermore, it is insensible for Comma or Comment to be the same rune.
    Allowing this leaks implementation details to the user in regards to
    the evaluation order of which rune is checked for first.
    
    Fixes #22404
