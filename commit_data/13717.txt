    runtime/pprof: restore articles in type doc comments
    
    Reverts part of CL 6460082.
    
    If a doc comment describes a type by explaining the
    meaning of one instance of the type, a leading article
    is fine and makes the text less awkward.
    
    Compare:
    // A dog is a kind of animal.
    // Dog is a kind of animal.
