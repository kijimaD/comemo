    net/http: ensure server handler is done in TestServerNoWriteTimeout
    
    Surprisingly, newClientServerTest doesn't ensure that server handlers
    are done in its t.Cleanup function. This test's handler can outlive
    the test and attempt to log after the test has completed, causing
    race detector failures.
    
    Add an explicit call to Server.Shutdown to ensure the handler
    has completed.
    
    We should also probably add a Shutdown to clientServerTest.close,
    but that's a larger change; this fixes the immediate problem.
