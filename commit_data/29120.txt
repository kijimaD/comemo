    compress/flate: make compression level 0 consistent
    
    Tests for determinism was not working as intended since io.Copybuffer
    uses the io.WriterTo if available.
    
    This exposed that level 0 (no compression) changed output
    based on the number of writes and buffers given to the
    writer.
    
    Previously, Write would emit a new raw block (BTYPE=00) for
    every non-empty call to Write.
    
    This CL fixes it such that a raw block is only emitted upon
    the following conditions:
            * A full window is obtained (every 65535 bytes)
            * Flush is called
            * Close is called
