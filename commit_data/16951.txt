    runtime: do not park sysmon thread if any goroutines are running
    Sysmon thread parks if no goroutines are running (runtime.sched.npidle ==
    runtime.gomaxprocs).
    Currently it's unparked when a goroutine enters syscall, it was enough
    to retake P's from blocking syscalls.
    But it's not enough for reliable goroutine preemption. We need to ensure that
    sysmon runs if any goroutines are running.
