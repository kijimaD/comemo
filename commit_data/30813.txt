    cmd/link: fix sym sect when splitting text on ppc64le
    
    While processing a symbol for a function, if it is determined
    that a function would make the text section too large then
    a new text section is created and the address of the function
    is in the new text section.  But the symbol for the function
    is marked as being in the previous text section, causing
    incorrect codegen for the function and leading to a segv if
    that function is called.  This adds code to set the sym.Sect
    field to the new section if a new one is created.  Note that
    this problem only happens at the point where a new section is
    created.
    
    Fixes #18218
