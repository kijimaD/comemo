    syscall: ignore getwd errors when fixing working directory on Plan 9
    
    In Plan 9, goroutines can run in different processes,
    which don't share their working directory. However,
    Go expects the working directory to be program-wide.
    
    We use a Fixwd function to fix the working directory
    before calling system calls which depend on the
    working directory.
    
    In fixwdLocked, the working directory is not fixed
    when getwd returns an error. However, an error can
    happen is some cases, notably when the directory
    has been previously removed in another process.
    
    Fixes #10422.
