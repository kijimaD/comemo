    cmd/link: put runtime.framepointer_enabled in DATA instead of RODATA
    
    On darwin, only writable symbol is exported
    (cmd/link/internal/ld/macho.go:/machoShouldExport).
    For plugin to work correctly, global variables, including
    runtime.framepointer_enabled which is set by the linker, need
    to be exported when dynamic linking. Put it in DATA so it is
    exported. Also in Go it is defined as a var, which is not
    read-only.
    
    While here, do the same for runtime.goarm.
    
    Fixes #24653.
