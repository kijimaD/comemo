    build: fix header files for Plan 9
    
    The "elf.h" header changes involve only comments, the released
    Plan 9 C preprocessing function does not cope with multiline
    comments following the #define keyword.  All multiline comments
    have been moved to the line above the associated definition.
    Sigh!  Fixing the Plan 9 compiler is not an option.
    
    <time.h> does not exist in the Plan 9 Native library.  I have
    moved it from src/cmd/ld/pe.h to include/u.h. RSC correctly points
    out that this copy of <u.h> is not the one used to compile the
    Go release on Plan 9 platforms.
