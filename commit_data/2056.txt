commit 3cc702ba60587aaefbc953e93eedbe1f9dd9166e
Author: David Symonds <dsymonds@golang.org>
Date:   Sun Apr 19 21:17:27 2009 -0700

    Initial cut at an "exported variables" (exvar) package.
    
    This handles integer-valued vars in a singleton struct, and exports functions
    for incrementing, setting and getting those vars, as well as rendering all the
    vars in a standard format.
    
    Demonstrate the use of the exvar package in the http/triv server.
