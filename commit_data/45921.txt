    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: make ir.Func the ODCLFUNC Node implementation
    
    Before this CL, an ODCLFUNC Node was represented by both
    a node struct and a Func struct (and a Name for the ONAME,
    which isn't changing here). Now Func can be repurposed as
    the ODCLFUNC implementation, replacing the two structs
    totaling 280+144 = 424 bytes (64-bit) with a single 320-byte struct.
    
    Using the *Func as the node also gives us a clear, typed answer to
    “which node should we use to represent functions?”
    The next CL will clean up uses. This CL is just the trivial
    change in representation.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
