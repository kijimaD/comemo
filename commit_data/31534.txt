    cmd/compile: allow OpVarXXX calls to be duplicated in writebarrier blocks
    
    OpVarXXX Values don't generate instructions,
    so there's no reason not to duplicate them,
    and duplicating them generates better code
    (fewer branches).
    
    This requires changing the start/end accounting
    to correctly handle the case in which we have run
    of Values beginning with an OpVarXXX, e.g.
    OpVarDef, OpZeroWB, OpMoveWB.
    In that case, the sequence of values should begin
    at the OpZeroWB, not the OpVarDef.
    
    This also lays the groundwork for experimenting
    with allowing duplication of some scalar stores.
    
    Shrinks function text sizes a tiny amount:
