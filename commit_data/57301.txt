    src/buildall.bash: mention no longer being used by Go build system
    
    The buildall.bash script was initially added in 2015 (in CL 9438),
    documented as used in the implementation of the new compile-only
    builders at the time.
    
    That description was updated as the builder implementation changed
    from "linux-amd64-compilesmoke" to "all-compile" and most recently
    to "misc-compile", which it still mentions today.
    
    The build system stopped using it in CL 464955 and there are no plans
    to use it again in the future, so update the description so that it's
    not misleading. Notably, adding additional checks to this script does
    not mean they will be caught by builders.
    
    Updates #31916.
    Updates #58163.
