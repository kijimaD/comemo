    runtime: account for guard zone in Windows stack size
    
    Windows includes an 8K guard in system-allocated thread stacks, which
    we currently don't account for when setting the g0 stack bounds. As a
    result, if we do overflow the g0 stack bounds, we'll get a
    STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION exception, which we're not expecting.
    
    Fix the g0 stack bounds to include a total of 16K of slop to account
    for this 8K guard.
    
    Updates #21382.
