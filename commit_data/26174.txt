    cmd/compile: consolidate Type construction and copying code
    
    This should is preparatory cleanup to make it easier to use separate
    types to represent each kind of Go type, rather than a single omnibus
    Type struct with heavily overloaded fields.
    
    Also, add TODO comments marking assignments that change an existing
    Type's kind, as they need to be removed before we can factor Type.
