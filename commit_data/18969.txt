    regexp/syntax: remove InstLast
    
    This was added by the one-pass CL (post Go 1.2)
    so it can still be removed.
    
    Removing because surely there will be new operations
    added later, and we can't change the constant value
    once we define it, so "last" is a bad concept to expose.
    
    Nothing uses it.
