    runtime: prevent preemption while timer is in timerModifying
    
    Currently if a goroutine is preempted while owning a timer in the
    timerModifying state, it could self-deadlock. When the goroutine is
    preempted and calls into the scheduler, it could call checkTimers. If
    checkTimers encounters the timerModifying timer and calls runtimer on
    it, then runtimer will spin, waiting for that timer to leave the
    timerModifying state, which it never will.
    
    So far we got lucky that for the most part that there were no preemption
    points while timerModifying is happening, however CL 221077 seems to
    have introduced one, leading to sporadic self-deadlocks.
    
    This change disables preemption explicitly while a goroutines holds a
    timer in timerModifying. Since only checkTimers (and thus runtimer) is
    called from the scheduler, this is sufficient to prevent
    preemption-based self-deadlocks.
    
    Fixes #38070.
    Updates #37894.
