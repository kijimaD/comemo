    cmd/link: do not use GO_LDSO when cross compile
    
    GO_LDSO is a setting that is set when the toolchain is build. It
    only makes sense to use it on the host platform. Do not use it
    when targetting a different platform.
    
    In the past it was not a problem as GO_LDSO was almost always
    unset. Now, with CL 301989 it is almost always set (maybe we want
    to revisit it).
    
    Fixes #47760.
