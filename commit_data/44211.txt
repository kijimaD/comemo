    runtime: check gdb exit status and log output
    
    All GDB tests currently ignore non-zero exit statuses. When tests
    flakes, we don't even know if GDB exited successfully or not.
    
    Add checks for non-zero exits, which are not expected.
    
    Furthermore, always log the output from GDB. The tests are currently
    inconsistent about whether they always log, or only on error.
    
    Updates #39021
