    test: lock in test for _ assignment evaluation/zerodivide panic
    
    Fixes #5790.
    Fixes #18421.
    
    * Lock in _ = x1/x2 divide by zero runtime panics since
    it is actually evaluated and not discarded as in previous
    versions before Go1.8.
    * Update a test that was skipping over zerodivide tests
    that expected runtime panics, enabling us to check for
    the expected panics.
