    runtime: align stack pointer during initcgo call on arm
    
    This is what is causing freebsd/arm to crash mysteriously when using cgo.
    The bug was introduced in golang.org/cl/4030, which moved this code out
    of rt0_go and into its own function. The ARM ABI says that calls must
    be made with the stack pointer at an 8-byte boundary, but only FreeBSD
    seems to crash when this is violated.
    
    Fixes #10119.
