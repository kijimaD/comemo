    debug/elf: change R_ARM_REL32 to R_ARM_ABS32 in applyRelocationsARM
    
    The original version of applyRelocationsARM was added in
    http://golang.org/cl/7266.  It was added to fix the ARM build, which
    had been broken by http://golang.org/cl/6780.
    
    Before CL 6780, there was no relocation processing for ARM.  CL 6780
    changed the code to require relocation processing for every supported
    target.  CL 7266 fixed the ARM build by adding a relocation processing
    function, but in fact no actual processing was done.  The code only
    looked for REL32 relocations, but ARM debug info has no such
    relocations.  The test case added in CL 7266 doesn't have any either.
    
    This didn't matter because no relocation processing was required on
    ARM, at least not for GCC-generated debug info.  GCC generates ABS32
    relocations, but only against section symbols which have the value 0.
    Therefore, the addition done by correct handling of ABS32 doesn't
    change anything.
    
    Clang, however, generates ABS32 relocations against local symbols,
    some of which have non-zero values.  For those, we need to handle
    ABS32 relocations.
    
    This patch corrects the CL 7266 to look for ABS32 relocations instead
    of REL32 relocations.  The code was already written to correctly
    handle ABS32 relocations, it just mistakenly said REL32.
    
    This is the ARM equivalent of https://golang.org/cl/96680045, which
    fixed the same problem in the same way for clang on 386.
    
    With this patch, clang-3.5 can be used to build Go on ARM GNU/Linux.
    
    Fixes #8980.
