    math/big: correctly handle large exponent in SetString
    
    Even though the umul/uquo functions expect two valid, finite big.Floats
    arguments, SetString was calling them with possibly Inf values, which
    resulted in bogus return values.
    
    Replace umul and udiv calls with Mul and Quo calls to fix this. Also,
    fix two wrong tests.
    
    See relevant issue on issue tracker for a detailed explanation.
    
    Fixes #11341
