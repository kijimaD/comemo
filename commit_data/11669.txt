    cmd/dist: prevent race on VERSION creation
    
    Commands such as "dist version > VERSION" will cause
    the shell to create an empty VERSION file and set dist's
    stdout to its fd. dist in turn looks at VERSION and uses
    its content if available, which is empty at this point.
    
    Fix that by ignoring VERSION if it's empty.
    
    Also prevent cmdversion from running findgoversion a
    second time. It was already loaded by init.
