    runtime: say where the compiler knows about var writeBarrier
    
    The runtime.writeBarrier variable tries to be helpful by telling you
    that the compiler also knows about this variable, which you could
    probably guess, but doesn't say how the compiler knows about it. In
    fact, the compiler has a complete copy in builtin/runtime.go that
    needs to be kept in sync. Say so.
