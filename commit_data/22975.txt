    runtime: export main.main for android
    
    Previously we started the Go runtime from a JNI function call, which
    eventually called the program's main function. Now the runtime is
    initialized by an ELF initialization function as a c-shared library,
    and the program's main function is not called. So now we export main
    so it can be called from JNI.
    
    This is necessary for all-Go apps because unlike a normal shared
    library, the program loading the library is not written by or known
    to the programmer. As far as they are concerned, the .so is
    everything. In fact the same code is compiled for iOS as a normal Go
    program.
