    [dev.typeparams] go/types: import the Type API from dev.go2go
    
    Import the Type changes from the dev.go2go branch, as well as a minimal
    set of related changes to the Checker code so that tests pass. This
    involved making some decisions about which functionality to import, with
    some parts of the Type API (for example instance.expand) carved out as
    they pulled in too many additional changes.
    
    Minimal changes were made from the dev.go2go version. Notably:
     + The aType helper struct is removed. It could have been removed in CL
       274852 but was missed.
     + writeTParamList was cleaned up for the bracketed parameter style.
     + Some interface iteration functions were simplified.
    
    One observation along the way is that, especially with converter methods
    removed from the Type interface, we should probably avoid storing the
    Checker on Type instances for lazy evaluation. If a function is only
    valid during a checking pass, we should make it a method on Checker
    instead of a method on the Type instance. Rather than do this now, which
    would make later changes harder to import, I left a couple TODOs to
    address this later.
