    runtime: avoid potential deadlock when tracing memory code
    
    In reclaimChunk, the runtime is calling traceGCSweepDone() while holding the mheap
    lock. traceGCSweepDone() can call traceEvent() and traceFlush(). These functions
    not only can get various trace locks, but they may also do memory allocations
    (runtime.newobject) that may end up getting the mheap lock. So, there may be
    either a self-deadlock or a possible deadlock between multiple threads.
    
    It seems better to release the mheap lock before calling traceGCSweepDone(). It is
    fine to release the lock, since the operations to get the index of the chunk of
    work to do are atomic. We already release the lock to call sweep, so there is no
    new behavior for any of the callers of reclaimChunk.
    
    With this change, mheap is a leaf lock (no other lock is ever acquired while it
    is held).
    
    Testing: besides normal all.bash, also ran all.bash with --long enabled, since
    it does longer tests of runtime/trace.
