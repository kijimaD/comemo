    go/types: fix method set computation if receiver is a named pointer
    
    Per the spec, methods cannot be associated with a named pointer type.
    Exit early with an empty method set in this case.
    
    This matches the corresponding check in LookupFieldOrMethod;
    the check is not present in (lowercase) lookupFieldOrMethod
    because it (the check) doesn't apply to struct fields.
    
    Fixes #60634.
