    cmd/link: don't emit PAX_FLAGS segment on Linux
    
    We started emitting this segment in 2012 in CL 6326054 for #47.
    It disabled three kinds of protection: mprotect, randexec, and emutramp.
    The randexec protection was deprecated some time ago, replaced by PIE.
    The emutramp and mprotect protection was because we used to rely on being
    able to create writable executable memory to implement function closures,
    but that is not true since https://go.dev/s/go11func was implemented.
