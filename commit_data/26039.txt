commit 991716508326b45615d55ffe6830f156d1d2e888
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 14 12:12:57 2015 -0500

    cmd/internal/obj: remove 3 incorrect copyright notices
    
    These three files contain only code written for Go
    (and trivial amounts at that), not any code ported
    from Inferno or Plan 9.
    
    Remove the incorrect Inferno/Plan 9 notices.
    
    Fixes #13576.
