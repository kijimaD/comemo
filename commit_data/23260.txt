    cmd/link: implement -buildid for non-ELF binaries
    
    Non-ELF binary formats are much less flexible and typically do not
    have a good place to store the build ID.
    
    We store it as raw bytes at the beginning of the text segment.
    
    The only system I know of that will be upset about this is NaCl,
    and NaCl is an ELF system and does not use this.
    
    For #11048.
