    time: Fix ordering of slots in AfterQueueing test
    
    We shouldn't sort the slots array, as it is used each time the
    test is run.  Tests after the first should continue to use the
    unsorted ordering.
    
    Note that this doesn't fix the flaky test.  Just a bug I saw
    while investigating.
