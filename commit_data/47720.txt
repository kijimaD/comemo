    cmd/go: fix tests broken in CL 358539
    
    CL 358539 revised the build-stamp format, and updated the git and hg
    tests to match. However, the fossil and bzr tests were missed, and
    were not caught on the builders due to the fact that none of the
    builder images have the necessary VCS tools installed.
