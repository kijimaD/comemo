    archive/tar: isolate regular and sparse file handling as methods
    
    Factor out the regular file handling logic into handleRegularFile
    from nextHeader. We will need to reuse this logic when fixing #15573
    in a future CL.
    
    Factor out the sparse file handling logic into handleSparseFile.
    Currently this logic is split between nextHeader (for GNU sparse
    files) and Next (for PAX sparse files). Instead, we move this
    related code into a single method.
    
    There is no overall logic change. Thus, no unit tests.
    
    Updates #15573 #15564
