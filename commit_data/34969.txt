    reflect: fix interface to interface conversion in Call
    
    Call is meant to mirror the language semantics, which allow:
    
            var r io.ReadWriter
            f := func(io.Reader){}
            f(r)
    
    even though the conversion from io.ReadWriter to io.Reader is
    being applied to a nil interface. This is different from an explicit
    conversion:
    
            _ = r.(io.Reader)
            f(r.(io.Reader))
    
    Both of those lines panic, but the implicit conversion does not.
    
    By using E2I, which is the implementation of the explicit conversion,
    the reflect.Call equivalent of f(r) was inadvertently panicking.
    Avoid the panic.
    
    Fixes #22143.
