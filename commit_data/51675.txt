    cmd/go: shorten TestScript/test_shuffle and skip it in short mode
    
    test_shuffle was added in CL 310033. It takes about 4½ seconds on my
    workstation prior to this CL, most of which is spent linking and
    running test binaries in 'go test'.
    
    We can reduce that time somewhat (to 3¾ seconds) by simply running the
    test fewer times (cases of 'off', 'on', positive, zero, and negative
    values seem sufficient), but we should also avoid that linking
    overhead at all in short mode.
    
    Fixes #57709.
