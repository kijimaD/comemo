commit 0d1e90be17239b7711aad51a9f5af4b87c2e7e7d
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 11 18:07:22 2008 -0700

    - added 'nil' keyword to lang doc
      (did not add 'true' and 'false' because I think these don't need to be
      keywords, they can be recreated from whole cloth)
    - added 'new' syntax to expressions
      (this is needed because of the type as 1st argument - the expression
      list is probably not yet implemented, but I think we may want it
      eventually)
    - removed optional ';'s in sieve example - make it more concise
    - fixed several bugs in go.atg, no parses sieve
    - added sieve as test case
