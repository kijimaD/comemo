    cmd/go: provide a more helpful suggestion for "go vet -?"
    
    For the command
    
            go vet -?
    
    the output was,
    
            usage: go vet [-n] [-x] [-vettool prog] [build flags] [vet flags] [packages]
            Run 'go help vet' for details.
            Run 'go tool vet -help' for the vet tool's flags.
    
    but "go help vet" is perfunctory at best. (That's another issue I'm
    working on—see https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/tools/+/291909—
    but vendoring is required to sort that out.) Add another line and rewrite
    a bit to make it actually helpful:
    
            usage: go vet [-n] [-x] [-vettool prog] [build flags] [vet flags] [packages]
            Run 'go help vet' for details.
            Run 'go tool vet help' for a full list of flags and analyzers.
            Run 'go tool vet -help' for an overview.
