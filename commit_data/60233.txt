    doc/next: preannounce a new Linux kernel version requirement
    
    This change adds a preannouncement to the release notes. Go 1.24
    will require the Linux kernel to be at version 3.17 or later,
    with an exception that systems running 3.10 or later will
    continue to be supported if the kernel has been patched to
    support the getrandom system call.
    
    For #65614
    For #67001
