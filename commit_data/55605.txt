    cmd/link: check for power10 support on external linker for PPC64
    
    The external linker will need to support the new PC relative relocations
    when they are generated by Go in a future patch. If it does not, many
    unhelpful relocation errors will be generated by the external linker.
    
    Use the -mcpu=power10 option as a surrogate for -mpcrel. It most cases,
    it should indicate whether the underlying linker has support for
    resolving PC relative relocations.
