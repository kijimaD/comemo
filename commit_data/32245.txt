    runtime/trace: iterate over frames instead of PCs
    
    Now the runtime/trace tests pass with -l=4.
    
    This also gets rid of the frames cache for multiple reasons:
    
    1) The frames cache was used to avoid repeated calls to funcname and
    funcline. Now these calls happen inside the CallersFrames iterator.
    
    2) Maintaining a frames cache is harder: map[uintptr]traceFrame
    doesn't work since each PC can map to multiple traceFrames.
    
    3) It's not clear that the cache is important.
