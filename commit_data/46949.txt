    testing: don't allow f.Log/Logf or f.Skipped inside f.Fuzz
    
    This change also does some refactors around how
    we prevent many (*F) methods from being called
    inside (*F).Fuzz. Previously, there was a lot of
    comment/code duplication, which was going to be
    difficult to maintain and brittle. The refactor
    lessens this duplication.
    
    Previously, the methods Log, Logf, Failed, Name and
    Skipped were the only (*common) methods that were
    allowed to be called inside (*F).Fuzz. After this
    change, Failed and Name are still allowed, but
    Log, Logf, and Skipped are not (t.Log, t.Logf, or
    t.Skipped should be used instead).
    
    Fixes #48988
