    cmd/fix: allow cgo commands in tests to fail if 'go build' is not supported
    
    testenv.HasCgo reports whether the test binary may have been built
    with cgo enabled, but having been built with cgo does not necessarily
    imply that the test can invoke the cgo tool itself.
    
    This should fix a test failure on the android builders introduced in
    CL 450714.
