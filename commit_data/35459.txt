    cmd/compile: single pass over Blocks in Liveness.epilogue
    
    Currently Liveness.epilogue makes three passes over the Blocks, but
    there's no need to do this. Combine them into a single pass. This
    eliminates the need for blockEffects.lastbitmapindex, but, more
    importantly, will let us incrementally compact the liveness bitmaps
    and significantly reduce allocatons in Liveness.epilogue.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
    
    Updates #24543.
