    cmd/go: use RawToken to parse remote package metadata
    
    CL 14315 broke the tests for parsing loosely formed remote package
    metadata. Switch the parsing to use RawToken to recover the previous
    behaviour that Token provided.
    
    It could be argued that the parser should be stricter, but as remote
    metadata has been readable with the parser for several years, it is
    safer to change the parser to continue to accept the samples provided
    in the test cases.
