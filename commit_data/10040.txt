    5l, 6l, 8l: correct ELFRESERVE diagnostic
    
    If the length of the interpreter string
    pushes us over the ELFRESERVE limit, the
    resulting error message will be comical.
    
    I was doing some ELF tinkering with a
    modified version of 8l when I hit this.
    
    To be clear, the stock linkers wouldn't
    hit this without adding about forty more
    section headers.  We're safe for now. ;)
    
    Also, remove a redundant call to cflush.
