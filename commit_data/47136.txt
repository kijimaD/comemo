    image/draw: rename and reorder some benchmarks
    
    The intention is for BenchmarkFooBar functions to map 1:1 to drawFooBar
    functions. Recent draw.go changes have added more drawFooBar functions
    and have further modified the mapping, as fallback drawFooBar functions
    aren't invoked as often as they used to.
    
    This commit restores the 1:1 mapping and reorganizes the BenchmarkFooBar
    functions in the same order as the matching drawFooBar functions appear.
    
    Also modify a TestDraw test case from vgradGreen(255) = {0, 136, 0, 255}
    to vgradGreen(90) = {0, 48, 0, 90}. Doing so matches the existing "The
    source pixel is {0, 48, 0, 90}" comment but also makes for a more
    interesting test case, as the source pixel is no longer fully opaque.
    Fully opaque is already covered by the vgradGray() test case on the next
    line.
    
    Also fix a "variable source" comment copy-pasto when the source image is
    actually uniform, not variable.
    
    Also add a func DrawMask type switch comment about interface types.
