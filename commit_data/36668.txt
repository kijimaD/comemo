    runtime: use debugSelect flag to toggle debug code
    
    This block of code once was commented by the original author, but commenting
    code looks a little annoying. However, the debugSelect flag is just for the
    situation that debug code will be compiled when debuging, when release this
    code will be eliminated by the compiler.
