    os/signal: split up sleeps waiting for signal
    
    Try to deflake TestNohup.
    
    The kernel will deliver a signal as a thread returns from a syscall.
    If the only active thread is sleeping, and the system is busy,
    the kernel may not get around to waking up a thread to catch the signal.
    Try splitting up the sleep, to give the kernel another change to deliver.
    
    I don't know if this will help, but it seems worth a try.
    
    Fixes #33174
