    testing: correct comments on runCleanup
    
    The comment on runCleanup states "If catchPanic is true ...", but
    there is no catchPanic argument or variable. This was introduced
    in CL 214822, which introduced the panicHandling type. The code was
    updated during code review, but the comment was missed.
