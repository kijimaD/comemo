    runtime: mark string comparison hooks as no split
    
    These functions can be inserted by the compiler into the code to be
    instrumented. This may result in these functions having callers that
    are nosplit. That is why they must be nosplit.
    
    This is a followup for CL 410034 in order to fix #53190.
