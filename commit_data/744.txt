commit 133c68e9ac911670cde197c456050aebc004d2e0
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 26 14:04:21 2008 -0700

    Simplification of Conversions section:
    - leave only basic type conversions in that section
    - we have a section of composite literals which covers those
    - we have a section prepared (but not written) on type guards
    - the built-in function "convert" doesn't need to be exposed
      as it is redundant
