    cmd/link: ignore mapping symbols on riscv64
    
    Specified in RISC-V ELF psABI[1], mapping symbols are symbols starting
    with "$d" or "$x" with STT_NOTYPE, STB_LOCAL and zero sizes, indicating
    boundaries between code and data in the same section.
    
    Let's simply ignore them as they're only markers instead of real symbols.
    This fixes linking errors like
    
            sym#63 ("$d"): ignoring symbol in section 4 (".riscv.attributes") (type 0)
    
    when using CGO together with Clang and internal linker, which are caused
    by unnecessary (but technically correct) mapping symbols created by LLVM
    for various sections.
