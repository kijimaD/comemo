    runtime: remove note about goid reuse
    
    Goids are designed to be big enough that they will never be reused:
    a uint64 is enough to generate a new goroutine every nanosecond
    for 500+ years before wrapping around, and after 500 years you
    should probably stop and pick up some security updates.
    
    This note was added in CL 70993 and appears to have just been
    a misunderstanding by the CL author.
