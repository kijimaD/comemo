    cmd/trace: change span id computation for trace view use
    
    golang.org/cl/102697 attempted to fix the span presentation by utilizing
    the position of the span in the span slices of a task. But it is
    not complete either.
    
    First, id=0 is omitted in json encoding and the trace viewer silently
    drops entries with the missing id field, so we must avoid zero-value id.
    Second, it is possible that a goroutine handles multiple tasks. Then,
    id collisions will happen.
    
    This takes a simpler approach - have a counter that increments for every
    emitSpan call, and use the value as the id value.
