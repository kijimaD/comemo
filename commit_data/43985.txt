    runtime/metrics: add ordering line to supported metrics docs
    
    This change adds an additional line explaining the ordering of the
    supported metrics list. It's also necessary to ensure "Supported
    metrics" is displayed by godoc as a proper header.
    
    This modification does mean the description test, that ensures
    descriptions line up with documentation, needs to change slightly
    so it it doesn't read this new line as documentation. Make this
    new line the line the test uses to decide when to begin.
