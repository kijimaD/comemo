commit dd95244d4b9be2dda0e899535fa6f7c637937617

    iostest.bash: build script for iOS
    
    In the spirit of nacltest.bash and androidtest.bash. Sets up the
    exec script and reboots the device.
    
    The reboot helps make sure previous runs do not interfere with the
    current run. It is reasonably easy for a bad program, e.g. one with
    a corrupt stack, to get the device stuck.
