    godoc: provide mode for flat (non-indented) directory listings
    
    This feature should make it easier to look at very large
    directory trees.
    
    - a new mode (URL: /pkg/?m=flat) shows directory listings w/o
      indentation and entries with full path (html and text mode)
    - in text mode, hierarchical (non-flat) directory listings are
      now presented with indentation (/pkg/?m=text)
    - in html mode, hierarchical (non-flat) directory listings are
      presented with slightly less indentation
    - there is an internal hook for programmatic control of the
      display mode (for specialized versions of godoc).
