commit b8df1465ccd8a45f8c7da66757ef18ad71c115fe
Author: Adam Langley <agl@golang.org>

    crypto/openpgp: better handling of keyrings.
    
      * Accept armored private key blocks
      * If an armored block is missing, return an InvalidArgumentError,
        rather than ignoring it.
      * If every key in a block is skipped due to being unsupported,
        return the last unsupported error.
      * Include the numeric type of unsupported public keys.
      * Don't assume that the self-signature comes immediately after the
        user id packet.
