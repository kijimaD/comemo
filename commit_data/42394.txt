    syscall: use SOCK_CLOEXEC when creating sockets
    
    LsfSocket, SetLsfPromisc and NetlinkRIB currently don't force the CLOEXEC
    flag on the sockets they create. While the former two functions are
    deprecated, NetlinkRIB is called by various functions related to
    net.Interface.
    
    Add a helper to create CLOEXEC sockets, and use it from SetLsfPromisc and
    NetlinkRIB. LsfSocket is unchanged since we don't want to break callers.
    
    Fixes #36053
