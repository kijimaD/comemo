    net: add initial MPTCP support
    
    This currently defines an internal function supportsMultipathTCP which
    reports whether MPTCP[1] is supported on the current platform.
    
    Only Linux is supported here.
    
    The check on Linux is performed once by attemting to create an MPTCP
    socket and look at the returned error:
    
    - If the protocol is not supported, EINVAL (kernel < 5.6) or
      EPROTONOSUPPORT (kernel >= 5.6) is returned and there is no point to
      try again.
    
    - Other errors can be returned:
      - ENOPROTOOPT: the sysctl knob net.mptcp.enabled is set to 0
      - Unpredictable ones: if MPTCP is blocked using SELinux, eBPF, etc.
    
    These other errors are due to modifications that can be reverted during
    the session: MPTCP can be available again later. In this case, it is
    fine to always try to create an MPTCP socket and fallback to TCP in case
    of error.
    
    This work has been co-developped by Gregory Detal
    <gregory.detal@tessares.net>.
