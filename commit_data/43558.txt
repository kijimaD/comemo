    internal/cpu: unify HWCap/HWCap2 comments
    
    HWCap and HWCap2 are no longer linknamed into package runtime. Also,
    merge two sentences both starting with "These are..." and don't mention
    any file name where archauxv is defined, as it become outdated if
    support for a new $GOOS/$GOARCH combination is added. This is e.g.
    already the case for arm64, where archauxv is also defined for
    freebsd/arm64.
