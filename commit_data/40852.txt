    runtime: use uintptr instead of int32 for counting to next heap profile sample
    
    Overflow of the comparison caused very large (>=1<<32) allocations to
    sometimes not get sampled at all. Use uintptr so the comparison will
    never overflow.
    
    Fixes #33342
    
    Tested on the example in 33342. I don't want to check a test in that
    needs that much memory, however.
