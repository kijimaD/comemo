    vcs: Add support for git.openstack.org
    
    Go is being proposed as an officially supported language for elements of
    OpenStack:
    
      https://review.openstack.org/#/c/312267/
    
    As such, repos that exist in OpenStack's git infrastructure
    are likely to become places from which people might want to go get
    things. Allow optional .git suffixes to allow writing code that depends
    on git.openstack.org repos that will work with older go versions while
    we wait for this support to roll out.
