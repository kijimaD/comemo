    net/http: rename tests for Redirect and StripPrefix
    
    Before May 2018, I mistakenly thought the _suffix naming convention¹
    used by examples also applied to tests. Thanks to a code review comment²
    from Ian Lance Taylor, I have since learned that is not true.
    This trivial change fixes some collateral damage from my earlier
    misunderstanding, resulting in improved test naming consistency.
