    misc/ios: include the bundle id in the GOIOS_APP_ID env variable
    
    The iOS exec wrapper use the constant bundle id "golang.gotest" for
    running Go programs on iOS. However, that only happens to work on
    the old iOS builders where their provisioning profile covers
    that bundle id.
    
    Expand the detection script to list all available provisioning
    profiles for the attached device and include the bundle id in the
    GOIOS_APP_ID environment variable.
    
    To allow the old builders to continue, the "golang.gotest" bundle
    id is used as a fallback if only the app id prefix is specified in
    GOIOS_APP_ID.
    
    For the new builders.
