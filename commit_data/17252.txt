    cmd/go, runtime/cgo: explicitly target ARMv5T
    
    The baseline architecture had been left to the GCC configured
    default which can be more accomodating than the rest of the Go
    toolchain.  This prevented instructions used by the 5g compiler,
    like BLX, from being used in GCC compiled assembler code.
