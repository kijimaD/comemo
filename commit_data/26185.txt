    os: change Open(`C:`) to open current directory on C:
    
    Open(`C:`) currently opens root directory on C:. Change that to open
    current directory on C:. Just like cmd.exe's "dir C:" command does.
    Just like FindFirstFile("C:*") Windows API does. It is also consistent
    with what filepath.Join("C:", "a") currently does.
    
    Fixes #13763
