    crypto/x509: be strict about trailing data.
    
    The X.509 parser was allowing trailing data after a number of structures
    in certificates and public keys. There's no obvious security issue here,
    esp in certificates which are signed anyway, but this change makes
    trailing data an error just in case.
    
    Fixes #10583
