    runtime: make mksyscall_windows.go flags do what they say they do
    
    The -systemdll and -xsys flags generate broken code in some situations
    (see issue for details). Fix all that.
    
    This CL only fixes bugs in existing code, but I have more changes comming:
    
    golang.org/x/sys/windows is not the only package that uses mksyscall_windows.go.
    golang.org/x/exp/shiny and github.com/derekparker/delve do too. I also have
    few personal packages that use mksyscall_windows.go. None of those packages
    are aware of new -xsys flag. I would like to change mksyscall_windows.go, so
    external packages do not need to use -xsys flag. I would love to get rid of
    -xsys flag altogether, but I don't see how it is possible. So I will, probably,
    replace -xsys with a flag that means opposite to -xsys, and use new flag
    everywhere in standard libraries. Flag name suggestions are welcome.
    
    -systemdll flag makes users code more "secure". I would like to make -systemdll
    behaviour a default for all mksyscall_windows.go users. We use that already in
    standard library. If we think "secure" is important, we should encourage it in
    all users code. If mksyscall_windows.go user insist on using old code, provide
    -use_old_loaddll (need good name here) flag for that. So -systemdll flag will
    be replaced with -use_old_loaddll.
    
    Fixes #15167
