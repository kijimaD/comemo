    runtime: pull heap profile cycle into a type
    
    Currently memRecord has the same set of four fields repeated three
    times. Pull these into a type and use this type three times. This
    cleans up and simplifies the code a bit and will make it easier to
    switch to a globally tracked heap profile cycle for #19311.
