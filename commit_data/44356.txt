    runtime: enable race detector on openbsd/amd64
    
    Now that this commit[1] has landed in LLVM the .syso file can be generated for
    OpenBSD.
    
    With the changes to src/runtime running the sample race[2] detects the data
    race as expected.
    
    Based on golang/go#39464 (https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/237057) from
    Aaron Bieber <deftly@gmail.com>, however the race_openbsd_amd64.syso file has
    been built on OpenBSD 6.4 and necessary changes added to race.bash.
