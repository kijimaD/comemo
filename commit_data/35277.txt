    cmd/dist: fix computation of test timeout
    
    When dist test was updated to run "go test" with multiple package
    arguments at once, merging the logical test units into one execution,
    the hack to give cmd/go twice as much time wasn't updated.
    
    What was happening (even in the all.bash case) was that we were
    merging together, say, "cmd/go" and "bytes", and because bar was
    lexically earlier, the timeout calculation was based on package "byte",
    even though we were actually running, say: "go test bytes cmd/go".
    
    This explains why x/build/cmd/release was often flaky with its
    all.bash, since cmd/go can't really finish in 3 minutes reliably
    unless it's running by itself. If it has any competition, it runs
    over.
