    cmd/dist: make cc rule match what cmd/go uses
    
    We added -I$GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH in cmd/go
    (I think for use by cgo and swig, primarily) but didn't
    update cmd/dist. I was testing some other code and
    found that my changes built with cmd/go but failed
    during the initial bootstrap. Make them match again.
