    container/list: fix Remove bug and use pointer to self as identifier
    
    Remove wasn't nil'ing the *Element.id. This property was exploited
    by MoveToFront and MoveToBack internally, so I renamed the existing
    Remove to "remove", and created an exported wrapper "Remove" that does
    the right thing for the user's sake.
    
    Also, saved an allocation by using *List as the id rather than *byte.
    
    Fixes #1224.
