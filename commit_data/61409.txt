    net/http: 308 redirects should use the previous hop's body
    
    On a 301 redirect, the HTTP client changes the request to be
    a GET with no body.
    
    On a 308 redirect, the client leaves the request method and
    body unchanged.
    
    A 308 following a 301 should preserve the rewritten request
    from the first redirect: GET with no body. We were preserving
    the method, but sending the original body. Fix this.
    
    Fixes #70180
