            the android runner script
    
            this is a version synthesized from rsc's, dean's and my
            versions. changes and updates:
    
            - embeds the retval script and pushes a new version to the
              device if needed
            - passes arguments correctly to the program on the device
            - export GOARCH, GOTRACEBACK and GOGC from the local
              environment to the device.
            - added times.out support to run-arm
    
            enabled a few tests that are now passing and moved the
            GOGC=off workaround to run-arm.
