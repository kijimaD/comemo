    cmd/compile: adjust starting token value
    
    The actual values assigned to tokens was inherited from the yacc-based
    grammar. With the most recent cleanups, all single-char tokens such as
    commas, semis, parens, etc., that get returned from lexer.next simply
    as their Unicode values are below utf8.RuneSelf (i.e., 7bit ASCII).
    Lower the initial starting value for named token constants accordingly.
