    cmd/compile: don't treat an InlMark as a read during deadstore
    
    An InlMark "read" can't make an otherwise dead store live. Without this
    CL, we sometimes zero an object twice in succession because we think
    there is a reader in between.
    
    Kind of challenging to make a test for this. The second zeroing has the
    same instruction on the same line number, so codegen tests can't see it.
    
    Fixes #67957
