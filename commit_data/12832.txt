commit 22690e662197836806e5d30a1bd49013ea16a50a
Author: Adam Langley <agl@golang.org>

    crypto/rsa: only enforce that de ≡ 1 mod |(ℤ/nℤ)*| in order to load private keys generated by GnuTLS.
    
    Previously we checked that de ≡ 1 mod φ(n). Since φ(n) is a multiple
    of |(ℤ/nℤ)*|, this encompassed the new check, but it was too strict as
    keys generated by GnuTLS would be rejected when gcd(p-1,q-1)≠1.
    
    (Also updated the error strings in crypto/rsa to contain the package name, which some were missing.)
