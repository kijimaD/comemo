commit 5958dd6f94696c6b88600be6b2033824202f8b13
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 4 17:19:21 2009 -0800

    Suggested tweaks up to package section.
    
    Major ones:
    * Be consistent: "numeric type" and "arithmetic operator".
    * if/swtch take "simple statement" not "short variable declaration".
    * There was a comment that implied for x,y := range z() might
      evaluate z() multiple times.  I deleted it.
