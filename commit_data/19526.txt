    time: avoid broken fix for buggy TestOverflowRuntimeTimer
    The test requires that timerproc runs, but busy loops and starves
    the scheduler so that, with high probability, timerproc doesn't run.
    Avoid the issue by expecting the test to succeed; if not, a major
    outside timeout will kill it and let us know.
    
    As you can see from the diffs, there have been several attempts to
    fix this with chicanery, but none has worked. Don't bother trying
    any more.
    
    Fixes #8136.
