    cmd/link: don't sort data symbols by name
    
    For data symbols, we currently sort them by size, then by name if
    the size is the same. Sorting by name is not really necessary.
    Instead, we sort by symbol index. Like name, the symbol index is
    deterministic, and pretty stable if only a small portion of the
    input is changed, and also naturally partitioned by packages. This
    reduces the CPU time for reading the symbol names and comparing
    strings.
