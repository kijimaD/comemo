    [dev.typeparams] go/types: import changes to types.Info from dev.go2go
    
    Import changes related to tracking type inferences and sanitizing
    types.Info from the dev.go2go branch. Notably, the following were all
    intentionally omitted from this import:
     + types.Error.Full is not imported, due to it being a public API that
       requires some further thought.
     + The Config.AcceptMethodTypeParams, InferFromConstraints, and Trace
       flag are not imported. The expectation is that we will not accept
       method type parameters for now, will always infer from constraints,
       and will continue to use the trace constant to guard tracing.
     + Some trace annotations are not imported to from the checking pass. We
       can add them back later, but for now they seemed verbose.
     + Checker.useBrackets is removed. This is no longer configurable.
