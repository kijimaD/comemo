    net/http: quiet some log spam in tests
    
    One of these tests creates a bunch of connections concurrently, then
    discovers it doesn't need them all, which then makes the server log
    that the client went away midway through the TLS handshake. Perhaps
    the server should recognize that as a case not worthy of logging
    about, but this is a safer way to eliminate the stderr spam during go
    test for now.
    
    The other test's client gives up on its connection and closes it,
    similarly confusing the server.
