commit b817e97961ce47b0bafde75c1038ba2074f84897

    change code font to "monospace", which will
    let the browser use the font the user has set up
    as the default fixed-width font, instead of forcing Courier.
    
    also set the size to 100%, which means 100% of the
    font size in the surrounding text.  this looks a little
    better in the main body but much better when the
    code is in a heading (like Package unsafe).
