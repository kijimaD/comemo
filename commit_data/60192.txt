    doc/README: suggest a way to preview next content, tweak release steps
    
    Smaller edits are usually fine to do without previewing, since Markdown
    can be intuitive. But for larger changes including re-ordering sections
    and such, it can be helpful to quickly see the end result. Write down a
    way to do that.
    
    Update the release steps to capture that the doc/next content will move
    to x/website before RC 1, when the complete release note draft is ready.
    
    For #64169.
