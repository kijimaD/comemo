    cmd/compile: allow huge rsh in constants arithmetic
    
    Currently an expression like
    
    var v = 0 >> 1000
    
    is rejected by gc with a "stupid shift" error, while gotype
    compiles it successfully.
    
    As suggested by gri on the issue tracker, allow an rsh right
    operand to be any valid uint value.
    
    Fixes #11328
