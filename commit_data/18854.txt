    cmd/gc: fix spurious type errors in walkselect.
    
    The lowering to runtime calls introduces hidden pointers to the
    arguments of select clauses. When implicit conversions were
    involved it could end up with incompatible pointers. Since the
    pointed-to types have the same representation, we can introduce a
    forced conversion.
    
    Fixes #6847.
