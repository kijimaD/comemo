    cmd/doc: try better when looking for package dir
    
    When go doc is invoked with a single package name argument (e.g. go doc pkgname)
    it needs to find the directory of the requested package sources in GOPATH.
    
    GOPATH might contain directories with the same name as the requested package
    that do no contain any *.go files. This change makes "go doc" ignore such
    directories when looking for possible package directories.
    
    This fixes #10882
