    http: Client test for streaming responses (no code changes)
    
    I had a report that this was broken. It seems fine.
    
    I think the reporter was just never flushing their response
    headers.  If I omit the test server's initial Flush I get the
    same behavior as reported. (a hang at Client.Get)
