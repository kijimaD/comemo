    go/doc: update header rules
    
    Go documentation can have header lines, which are single-line paragraphs
    with leading and trailing letters and almost no punctuation.
    Before this CL, the only allowed punctuation was ' followed by s.
    
    After this CL, parentheses and commas are also allowed,
    to pick up a pair of previously unrecognized headings in the
    go command documentation:
    
            Gofmt (reformat) package sources
            Modules, module versions, and more
