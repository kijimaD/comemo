    runtime: allow pointers to strings to be printed
    
    Being able to printer pointers to strings means one will able to output
    the result of things like the flag library and other components that use
    string pointers.
    
    While here, adjusted the tests for gdb to test original string pretty
    printing as well as pointers to them. It was doing it via the map before
    but for completeness this ensures it's tested as a unit.
