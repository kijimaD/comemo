    cmd/compile: remove totype0 type-constructor helpers
    
    These were originally introduced for the binary export format, which
    required forward references to arbitrary types and later filling them
    in. They're no longer needed since we switched to the indexed export
    format, which only requires forward references to declared types.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
