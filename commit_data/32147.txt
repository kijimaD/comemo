    cmd/compile: add a dowidth call to convas
    
    This dowidth currently happens during AST to SSA conversion.
    As such, it is a concurrency pinch point.
    It's a bit silly, but do it here in walk instead.
    This appears (fingers crossed) to be the last
    unresolved dowidth concurrency problem.
