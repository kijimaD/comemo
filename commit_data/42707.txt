    cmd/link: emit correct jump instruction on ARM for DYNIMPORT
    
    On ARM, for a JMP/CALL relocation, the instruction bytes is
    encoded in Reloc.Add (issue #19811). I really hate it, but before
    it is fixed we have to follow the rule and emit the right bits
    from r.Add.
    
    Fixes #40769.
