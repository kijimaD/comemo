    cmd/go: set TOOLEXEC_IMPORTPATH for -toolexec tools
    
    This way, a -toolexec tool can tell precisely what package is being
    built when it's run. This was very hard to do before, because the tool
    had to piece together that information given the build action's
    arguments or flags.
    
    Since there wasn't a good set of tests for -toolexec, add one in the
    form of a test script. It builds a simple set of packages with a variety
    of build tools, to ensure that all the cases behave as expected.
    
    Like other recent master changes, include the changelog item for this
    user-facing change too.
    
    Fixes #15677.
