    net: make windows (*netFD).connect work like its unix version
    
    CL 17821 used syscall.CancelIoEx to cancel outstanding connect
    call, but did not check for syscall.CancelIoEx return value.
    Also I am worried about introducing race here. We should use
    proper tools available for us instead. For example, we could
    use fd.setWriteDeadline just like unix version does. Do that.
