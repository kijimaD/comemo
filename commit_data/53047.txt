    cmd/dist: put cgo tests under a "Testing cgo" heading
    
    Currently the cgo tests mostly use their package name as a heading,
    which means we get a large number of test sections that each have a
    single test package in them.
    
    Unify them all under "Testing cgo" to reduce output noise.
    
    This leaves just the cmd/api test without a heading, so we give it a
    heading and require that all tests have a heading.
