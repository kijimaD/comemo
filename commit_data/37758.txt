    reflect: use a bigger object when we need a finalizer to run
    
    If an object is allocated as part of a tinyalloc, then other live
    objects in the same tinyalloc chunk keep the finalizer from being run,
    even if the object that has the finalizer is dead.
    
    Make sure the object we're setting the finalizer on is big enough
    to not trigger tinyalloc allocation.
    
    Fixes #26857
    Update #21717
