    runtime/pprof: clarify recursive inline heuristic
    
    Following CL 226818, the compiler will allow inlining a single cycle in
    an inline chain. Immediately-recursive functions are still disallowed,
    which is what this heuristic refers to.
    
    Add a regression test for this case.
    
    Note that in addition to this check, if the compiler were to inline
    multiple cycles via a loop (i.e., rather than appending duplicate code),
    much more work would be required here to handle a single address
    appearing in multiple different inline frames.
    
    Updates #29737
