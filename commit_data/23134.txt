    runtime: remove a modulus calculation from pollorder
    
    This is a follow-up to CL 9269, as suggested
    by dvyukov.
    
    There is probably even more that can be done
    to speed up this shuffle. It will matter more
    once CL 7570 (fine-grained locking in select)
    is in and can be revisited then, with benchmarks.
