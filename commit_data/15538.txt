    exp/ssa: fix bug in bridge method
    
    Bridge methods for embedded interfaces were
    passing the interface twice: once as receiver,
    once as first param.
    Covered by $GOROOT/test/ddd.go.
    
    Also:
    - invent names ("arg%d") for parameters if missing.
    - refactoring: move common code for bridge methods into
      createParams and emitTailCall.
