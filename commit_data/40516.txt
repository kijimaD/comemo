    all: remove PEM-encoded private keys from tests
    
    Gerrit is complaining about pushes that affect these files
    and forcing people to use -o nokeycheck, which defeats
    the point of the check. Hide the keys from this kind of scan
    by marking them explicitly as testing keys.
    
    This is a little annoying but better than training everyone
    who ever edits one of these test files to reflexively override
    the Gerrit check.
    
    The only remaining keys explicitly marked as private instead
    of testing are in examples, and there's not much to do
    about those. Hopefully they are not edited as much.
