    regexp/syntax: don't waste time checking for one pass algorithm
    The code recurs very deeply in cases like (?:x{1,1000}){1,1000}
    Since if much time is spent checking whether one pass is possible, it's not
    worth doing at all, a simple fix is proposed: Stop if the check takes too long.
    To do this, we simply avoid machines with >1000 instructions.
    
    Benchmarks show a percent or less change either way, effectively zero.
    
    Fixes #7608.
