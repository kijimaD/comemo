commit 7a33265ccdf37b7f15125f7e561e4da3a0e0ad9d

    time.RFC822: make the string standard-compliant
    For mysterious reasons, the existing string was just wrong: it was missing a colon.
    There is no apparent reason for this discrepancy.
    
    This should be safe to fix because existing uses would not be RFC822-compliant;
    people cannot be depending on it to generate correct mail headers.
    
    Fixes #3444.
