    runtime: use new instead of newobject to create hmap in makemap
    
    The runtime.hmap type is known at compile time.
    Using new(hmap) avoids loading the hmap type from the maptype
    supplied as an argument to makemap which is only known at runtime.
    
    This change makes makemap consistent with makemap_small
    by using new(hmap) instead of newobject in both functions.
