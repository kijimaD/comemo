    cmd/compile: order nil checks by source position
    
    There's nothing enforcing ordering between redundant nil checks when
    they may occur during the same memory state. Commit to using the
    earliest one in source order.
    
    Otherwise the choice of which to remove depends on the ordering of
    values in a block (before scheduling). That's unfortunate when trying
    to ensure that the compiler doesn't depend on that ordering for
    anything.
    
    Update #20178
