    net/http: don't panic after request if Handler sets Request.Body to nil
    
    The Server's server goroutine was panicing (but recovering) when
    cleaning up after handling a request. It was pretty harmless (it just
    closed that one connection and didn't kill the whole process) but it
    was distracting.
