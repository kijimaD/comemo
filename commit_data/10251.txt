    html,bzip2,sql: rename Error methods that return error to Err
    
    There are three classes of methods/functions called Error:
    
    a) The Error method in the just introduced error interface
    b) Error methods that create or report errors (http.Error, etc)
    c) Error methods that return errors previously associated with
       the receiver (Tokenizer.Error, rows.Error, etc).
    
    This CL introduces the convention that methods in case (c)
    should be named Err.
    
    The reasoning for the change is:
    
    - The change differentiates the two kinds of APIs based on
      names rather than just on signature, unloading Error a bit
    - Err is closer to the err variable name that is so commonly
      used with the intent of verifying an error
    - Err is shorter and thus more convenient to be used often
      on error verifications, such as in iterators following the
      convention of the sql package.
