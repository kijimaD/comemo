    runtime: eliminate write barriers from gentraceback
    
    gentraceback is used in many contexts where write barriers are
    disallowed. This currently works because the only write barrier is in
    assigning frame.argmap in setArgInfo and in practice frame is always
    on the stack, so this write barrier is a no-op.
    
    However, we can easily eliminate this write barrier, which will let us
    statically disallow write barriers (using go:nowritebarrierrec
    annotations) in many more situations. As a bonus, this makes the code
    a little more idiomatic.
    
    Updates #10600.
