    codereview: add release branch support
    
    Note that if you are working on the upcoming release
    branch you have to point your extension path to a
    copy of lib/codereview/codereview.py that won't change
    as the repository flips between release-branch and default branch.
    This warning should only apply to this one branch and only to rsc,
    but you never know.
