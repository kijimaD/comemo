    encoding/hex: save allocation in DecodeString()
    
    The destination slice does not need to be created at all. The source
    slice itself can be used as the destination because the decode loop
    increments by one and then the 'seen' byte is not used anymore. Therefore
    the decoded byte can be stored in that index of the source slice itself.
    
    This trick cannot be applied to EncodeString() because in that case,
    the destination slice is large than the source. And for a single byte
    in the source slice, two bytes in the destination slice is written.
    
    func BenchmarkDecodeString(b *testing.B) {
      for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        DecodeString("0123456789abcdef")
      }
    }
