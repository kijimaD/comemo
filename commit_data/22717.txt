    cmd/internal/ld: maintain Ctxt.Etextp when removing dead code
    
    I wrote some code that added a function in gentext() by sticking it
    after Ctxt.Etextp and was very confused when this wasn't written out
    sometimes. It turned out that Etextp was not updated by deadcode() so
    if the last function is not reachable, my new function was never
    seen. This changes deadcode() to update Etextp to the last reachable
    funtion.
