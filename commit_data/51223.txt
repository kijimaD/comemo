    misc/cgo/testcarchive: log command output more consistently
    
    Also check that executables exist immediately after building them
    in parallel tests.
    
    The parallel tests in this package occasionally fail with
    "no such file or directory", implying that either the build
    command failed to actually write out the binary or something
    concurrently deleted it.
    
    This is purely a shot in the dark, but I'm hoping that perhaps
    the stderr output from one of these commands will shed some
    light on the underlying failure mode.
    
    For #49693
