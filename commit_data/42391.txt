    encoding/asn1: document what Unmarshal returns in rest
    
    Specifically, this change documents the behavior of Unmarshal when a
    SEQUENCE contains trailing elements.
    
    For context Unmarshal treats trailing elements of a SEQUENCE that do not
    have matching struct fields as valid, as this is how ASN.1 structures
    are typically extended. This can be somewhat confusing as you might
    expect those elements to be appended to rest, but rest is really only
    for trailing data unrelated to the structure being parsed (i.e. if you
    append a second sequence to b, it would be returned in rest).
    
    Fixes #35680
