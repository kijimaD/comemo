+<pre>
+This weekly snapshot is very close to what we expect will be the contents of
+the Go 1 release. There are still a few minor documentation issues to resolve,
+and a handful of bugs that should be addressed before the release, but the vast
+majority of Go programs should be completely unaffected by any changes we make
+between now and the full release.
+
+If you're interested in helping us test, eager to try out Go 1, or just
+curious, this weekly snapshot is the one to try. We'll issue a new App Engine
+Go 1 beta SDK very soon, so if you're an App Engine user you can try it there
+too.
+
+To help us focus on any remaining bugs and avoid introducing new ones, we will
+restrict our attention to critical fixes and issues marked Go1-Must in the
+issue tracker. Everything non-essential will be held until after the Go 1
+release is cut and in the field for a while.
