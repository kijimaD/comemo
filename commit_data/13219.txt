    shootout: make mandelbrot.go more like mandelbrot.c
    
    Surprise! The C code is using floating point values for its counters.
    Its off the critical path, but the Go code and C code are supposed to
    be as similar as possible to make comparisons meaningful.
    
    It doesn't have a significant effect.
