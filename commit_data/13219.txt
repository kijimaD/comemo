        misc/emacs: Use patch output of gofmt instead of replacing the buffer.
    
    This uses the patch output of gofmt (-d option) and applies each
    chunk to the buffer, instead of replacing the whole buffer.  The
    main advantage is that the undo history is kept across gofmt'ings,
    so it can really be used as a before-save-hook.
