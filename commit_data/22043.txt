    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: bring asm on ppc64 in sync with 9a
    
    I created a .s file that covered every instruction and operand production
    in 9a/a.y and made sure that 9a and asm give bit-identical results for it.
    I found a few things, including one addressing mode (R1+R2) that was
    not present in the source we use. Fixed those
    
    I also found quite a few things where 9a's grammar accepts the instruction
    but liblink rejects it. These need to be sorted out, and I will do that separately.
    Once that's done, I'll turn my test file into a proper test.
