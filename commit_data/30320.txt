    go/doc: allow : in godoc links
    
    The emphasize function used a complex regexp to find URLs, which
    truncated some types of URL and did not match others.
    This has been simplified and adjusted to allow valid punctuation
    like :: or ! in the path part and :[] in the host part.
    Comments were added to clarify what this regexp allows.
    The path part matches query and fragment also so document this.
    Removed news, telnet, wais, and prospero protocols.
    
    Tests were added for:
     IPV6 URLs
     URLs surrounded by brackets
     URLs containing ::
     URLs containing :;!- in the path
    
    In order to allow punctuation and yet preserve current behaviour,
    URLs are not permitted to end in .,:;?! to allow the use of
    normal punctuation surrounding URLs in comments.
    
    Fixes #18139
