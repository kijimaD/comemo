    os: don't hide all methods in recursive call to io.Copy
    
    In order to avoid a recursive call to ReadFrom, we were converting
    a *File to an io.Writer. But all we really need to do is hide
    the ReadFrom method. In particular, this gives us the option of
    adding a WriteTo method.
    
    For #58808
