    cmd/go: clean the directory path containing the packages
    
    The heuristic for determining if the packages or commands are stale
    fails as the mtime comparison happens even though the GOROOT and
    current package paths are the same, since the path name isn't
    canonicalized before the comparison (GOROOT is).
    
    Fixes: #12690
