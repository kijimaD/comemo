    time: clean up benchmarks
    
    Comparing BenchmarkStop against very old commits like
    CL 13094043, I was very confused about how timers had
    gotten almost 10X slower since 2013.
    
    It turns out that CL 68060043 introduced a factor of 1000
    in the benchmark cost, by counting batches of 1000 as 1 op
    instead of 1000 ops, and timers have actually gotten
    dramatically faster since 2013, with the addition of per-P
    timer heaps and other optimizations.
    
    This CL rewrites the benchmarks to use testing.PB directly,
    so that the factor of 1000 disappears, and "/op" really means "/op".
    In the few tests that need to run in batches for one reason or
    another, add "1000" to the name to make clear that batches
    are being run.
