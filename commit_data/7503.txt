    crypto/rsa: left-pad OAEP results when needed.
    
    PKCS#1 v2.1 section 7.1.1 says that the result of an OAEP encryption
    is "an octet string of length $k$". Since we didn't left-pad the
    result it was previously possible for the result to be smaller when
    the most-significant byte was zero.
    
    Fixes #1519.
