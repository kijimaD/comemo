    net/http/httputil: fix race in DumpRequestOut
    
    Fixes #3892.
    
    Swapping the order of the writers inside the MultiWriter ensures
    the request will be written to buf before http.ReadRequest completes.
    
    The fencedBuffer is not required to make the test pass on
    any machine that I have access too, but as the buf is shared
    across goroutines, I think it is necessary for correctness.
