    cmd/dist: add serial/small build option for GOMAXPROCS=1
    
    If GOMAXPROCS=1, force serial execution, which is better for
    debugging build problems and also minimizes footprint, if that
    happens to matter.
    
    This wasn't good when the bootstrap was 1.4 because there
    default GOMAXPROCS=1, but that is no longer the bootstrap
    version.
