    misc/cgo: disable testcarchive, testplugin during -short test (including all.bash)
    
    These tests take 20 seconds each to rebuild the entire world
    in their respective modes. That's too much for short mode,
    including all.bash on developer machines.
    
    Keep doing it on builders and if someone runs 'go test' by hand
    in that directory.
    
    For #26473.
