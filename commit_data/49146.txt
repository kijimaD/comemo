    cmd/go: add timestamps to script test output
    
    Go tests don't include timestamps by default, but we would like to
    have them in order to correlate builder failures with server and
    network logs.
    
    Since many of the Go tests with external network and service
    dependencies are script tests for the 'go' command, logging timestamps
    here adds a lot of logging value with one simple and very low-risk
    change.
    
    For #50541.
    For #52490.
    For #52545.
    For #52851.
