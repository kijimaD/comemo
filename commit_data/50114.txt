    misc/cgo/testsanitizers: determine compiler version for tsan tests on ppc64le
    
    Some tests in misc/cgo/testsanitizers had been disabled on ppc64le
    until recently, due to an intermittent error in the tsan tests,
    with the goal of trying to understand the failure.
    
    After further investigation, I found that the code for tsan within
    gcc does not work consistently when ASLR is enabled on ppc64le. A
    fix for that problem was integrated in gcc 9.
    
    This adds a check to testsanitizers to determine the gcc compiler
    version on ppc64le and skip the test if the version is too old.
    
    A similar check is needed for asan too.
    
    Updates #54645
