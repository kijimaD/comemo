    runtime, syscall: add RawSyscall6 on Solaris and make it panic
    
    The syscall package currently declares RawSyscall6 for every GOOS, but
    does not define it on Solaris. This leads to code using said function
    to compile but it will not link. Fix it by adding RawSyscall6 and make
    it panic.
    
    Also remove the obsolete comment above runtime.syscall_syscall as
    pointed out by Aram.
    
    Updates #24357
