    doc: add link to go command modules docs from Go 1.11 release notes
    
    The FAQ already has a link to the release notes and the go command docs.
    Add a link from the release notes to the go command docs, to ensure that
    people ultimately end up there (the docs that then signpost
    people to the relevant other help docs).
    
    Updates #25517.
