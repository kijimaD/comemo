commit 52f111fb34a4f57404db53af4d89d4a25fcb114e

    cmd/compile: print regular error message in BOM corner-case
    
    This never happens but for pathological input where a BOM sequence
    is unfinished and ends in EOF (src: "package p\n\nfunc \xef\xef").
    No test case added because the /test framework doesn't lend itself
    easily to it in this case (file must end in EOF rather than comment).
    Instead, tested manually.
    
    Fixes #13268.
