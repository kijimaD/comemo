    runtime: remove obsolete afterprologue check
    Afterprologue check was required when did not know
    about return arguments of functions and/or they were not zeroed.
    Now 100% precision is required for stacks due to stack copying,
    so it must work w/o afterprologue one way or another.
    I can limit this change for 1.3 to merely adding a TODO,
    but this check is super confusing so I don't want this knowledge to get lost.
