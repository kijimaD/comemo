    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: make function epilogue async-signal safe
    
    When the frame size is large, we generate
    
    MOVD.P  0xf0(SP), LR
    ADD     $(framesize-0xf0), SP
    
    This is problematic: after the first instruction, we have a
    partial frame of size (framesize-0xf0). If we try to unwind the
    stack at this point, we'll try to read the LR from the stack at
    0(SP) (the new SP) as the frame size is not 0. But this slot does
    not contain a valid LR.
    
    Fix this by not changing SP in two instructions. Instead,
    generate
    
    MOVD    (SP), LR
    ADD     $framesize, SP
    
    This affects not only async preemption but also profiling. So we
    change the generated instructions, instead of marking unsafe
    point.
