    [dev.typeparams] runtime: mark assembly functions called directly from compiler ABIInternal
    
    For functions such as gcWriteBarrier and panicIndexXXX, the
    compiler generates ABIInternal calls directly. And they must not
    use wrappers because it follows a special calling convention or
    the caller's PC is used. Mark them as ABIInternal.
    
    Note that even though they are marked as ABIInternal, they don't
    actually use the internal ABI, i.e. regabiargs is not honored for
    now.
    
    Now all.bash passes with GOEXPERIMENT=regabiwrappers (at least on
    macOS).
