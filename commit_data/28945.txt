    runtime: keep gcMarkRootCheck happy with spare Gs
    
    oneNewExtraM creates a spare M and G for use with cgo callbacks. The G
    doesn't run right away, but goes directly into syscall status. For the
    garbage collector, it's marked as "scan valid" and not on the rescan
    list, but I forgot to also mark it as "scan done". As a result,
    gcMarkRootCheck thinks that the goroutine hasn't been scanned and
    panics.
    
    This only affects GODEBUG=gccheckmark=1 mode, since we otherwise skip
    the gcMarkRootCheck.
    
    Fixes #17473.
