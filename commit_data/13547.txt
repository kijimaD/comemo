    exp/html: tokenize attributes of end tags
    
    If an end tag has an attribute that is a quoted string containing '>',
    the tokenizer would end the tag prematurely. Now it reads the attributes
    on end tags just as it does on start tags, but the high-level interface
    still doesn't return them, because their presence is a parse error.
    
    Pass 1 additional test.
