    cmd/cgo: don't use absolute paths in the export header file
    
    We were using absolute paths in the #line directives in the export
    header file. This makes the header file change if you move GOPATH.
    The absolute paths aren't helpful for the final user, which is some C
    program elsewhere.
    
    Fixes #24945
