    runtime: make m.libcallsp check in shrinkstack panic
    
    Currently, shrinkstack will not shrink a stack on Windows if
    gp.m.libcallsp != 0. In general, we can't shrink stacks in syscalls
    because the syscall may hold pointers into the stack, and in principle
    this is supposed to be preventing that for libcall-based syscalls
    (which are direct syscalls from the runtime). But this test is
    actually broken and has been for a long time. That turns out to be
    okay because it also appears it's not necessary.
    
    This test is racy. g.m points to whatever M the G was last running on,
    even if the G is in a blocked state, and that M could be doing
    anything, including making libcalls. Hence, observing that libcallsp
    == 0 at one moment in shrinkstack is no guarantee that it won't become
    non-zero while we're shrinking the stack, and vice-versa.
    
    It's also weird that this check is only performed on Windows, given
    that we now use libcalls on macOS, Solaris, and AIX.
    
    This check was added when stack shrinking was first implemented in CL
    69580044. The history of that CL (though not the final version)
    suggests this was necessary for libcalls that happened on Go user
    stacks, which we never do now because of the limited stack space.
    
    It could also be defending against user stack pointers passed to
    libcall system calls from blocked Gs. But the runtime isn't allowed to
    keep pointers into the user stack for blocked Gs on any OS, so it's
    not clear this would be of any value.
    
    Hence, this checks seems to be simply unnecessary.
    
    Rather than simply remove it, this CL makes it defensive. We can't do
    anything about blocked Gs, since it doesn't even make sense to look at
    their M, but if a G tries to shrink its own stack while in a libcall,
    that indicates a bug in the libcall code. This CL makes shrinkstack
    panic in this case.
    
    For #10958, #24543, since those are going to rearrange how we decide
    that it's safe to shrink a stack.
