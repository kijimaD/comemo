    runtime: fix nacl/386 build
    
    I changed all the NACL_SYSJMP to NACL_SYSCALL in
    an earlier CL, but I missed the fact that NACL_SYSCALL
    will push another return PC on the stack, so that the
    arguments will no longer be in the right place.
    Since we have to make our own call, we also have to
    copy the arguments. Do that.
    
    Fixes nacl/386 build.
