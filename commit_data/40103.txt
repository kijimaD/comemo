    test: fix escape_runtime_atomic.go
    
    Casp1 is implemented in Go on js/wasm, so escape analysis correctly
    determines that the "old" parameter does not escape (which is good).
    
    Unfortunately, test/run.go doesn't have a way to indicate that ERROR
    messages are optional, and cmd/compile only emits diagnostics for "var
    x int" when it's moved to the heap; not when it stays on the stack.
    
    To accomodate that this test currently passes on some GOARCHes but not
    others, rewrite the Casp1 test to use "x := new(int)" and allow both
    "new(int) escapes to heap" or "new(int) does not escape".
    
    Updates #31525.
