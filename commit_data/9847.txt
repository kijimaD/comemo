    runtime: fix map memory leak
    
    The map implementation was using the C idiom of using
    a pointer just past the end of its table as a limit pointer.
    Unfortunately, the garbage collector sees that pointer as
    pointing at the block adjacent to the map table, pinning
    in memory a block that would otherwise be freed.
    
    Fix by making limit pointer point at last valid entry, not
    just past it.
