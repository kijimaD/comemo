    [dev.boringcrypto] cmd/go: pass dependency syso to cgo too
    
    Proposal #42477 asked for a way to apply conditional build tags
    to syso files (which have no source code to hold //go:build lines).
    
    We ended up suggesting that the standard answer should be to
    put the syso in its own package and then import that package from
    a source file that is itself conditionally compiled.
    
    A followup comment on that issue pointed out a problem that I did
    not understand until I tried to use this approach myself: the cgo
    build fails by default, because the link step only uses syso files from
    the current package. You have to override this explicitly by arranging
    to pass a “ignore unresolved symbols” flag to the host linker.
    Many users will not know how to do this.
    (I don't know how to do this off the top of my head.)
    
    If we want users to use this approach, we should make it work better.
    This CL does that, by including the syso files from dependencies of
    the current package in the link step.
    
    For #51940.
