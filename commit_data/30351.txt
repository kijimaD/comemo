    math/big: define Word as uint instead of uintptr
    
    For compatibility with math/bits uint operations.
    
    When math/big was written originally, the Go compiler used 32bit
    int/uint values even on a 64bit machine. uintptr was the type that
    represented the machine register size. Now, the int/uint types are
    sized to the native machine register size, so they are the natural
    machine Word type.
    
    On most machines, the size of int/uint correspond to the size of
    uintptr. On platforms where uint and uintptr have different sizes,
    this change may lead to performance differences (e.g., amd64p32).
