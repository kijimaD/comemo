    runtime: filter i/o async entries using completion key on windows
    
    In the case where a user program requests overlapped I/O directly on a
    handlethat is managed by the runtime, it is possible that
    runtime.netpoll will attempt to dereference a pointer with an invalid
    value. This CL prevents the runtime from accessing the invalid pointer
    value by adding a special key to each overlapped I/O operation that it
    creates.
    
    Fixes #58870
