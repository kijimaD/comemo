    runtime: use 64-bit negative error code on 64-bit machines
    
    NEGL does a negation of the bottom 32 bits and then zero-extends to 64 bits,
    resulting in a negative 32-bit number but a positive 64-bit number.
    
    NEGQ does a full 64-bit negation, so that the result is negative both as
    a 32-bit and as a 64-bit number.
    
    This doesn't matter for the functions that are declared to return int32.
    It only matters for the ones that return int64 or void* [sic].
    
    This will fix the current incorrect error in the OpenBSD/amd64 build.
    The build will still be broken, but it won't report a bogus error.
