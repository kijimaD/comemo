    cmd/go: skip TestScript on Plan 9 in short mode
    
    TestScript is very slow on Plan 9 because this test
    is particularly i/o intensive.
    
    This is leading the plan9/386 and plan9/amd64 builders
    to time out. This test was already skipped on plan9/arm
    because arm is part of the "slow architectures" list.
    
    This change skips TestScript on Plan 9 on short mode.
