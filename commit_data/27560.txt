    cmd/compile: eliminate dead code in walkappend
    
    The IsStruct case is meant to handle cases like append(f()) where f's
    result parameters are something like ([]int, int, int). However, at
    this point in the compiler we've already rewritten append(f()) into
    "tmp1, tmp2, tmp3 := f(); append(tmp1, tmp2, tmp3)".
    
    As further evidence, the t.Elem() is not a valid method call for a
    struct type anyway, which would trigger the Fatalf call in Type.Elem
    if this code was ever hit.
