    cmd/compile: add control flow graphs to ssa.html
    
    This CL adds CFGs to ssa.html.
    It execs dot to generate SVG,
    which then gets inlined into the html.
    Some standard naming and javascript hacks
    enable integration with the rest of ssa.html.
    Clicking on blocks highlights the relevant
    part of the CFG, and vice versa.
    
    Sample output and screenshots can be seen in #28177.
    
    CFGs can be turned on with the suffix mask:
    :*            - dump CFG for every phase
    :lower        - just the lower phase
    :lower-layout - lower through layout
    :w,x-y        - phases w and x through y
    
    Calling dot after every pass is noticeably slow,
    instead use the range of phases.
    
    Dead blocks are not displayed on CFG.
    
    User can zoom and pan individual CFG
    when the automatic adjustment has failed.
    
    Dot-related errors are reported
    without bringing down the process.
    
    Fixes #28177
