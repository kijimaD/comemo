    log/syslog: fix flakey test on slow hosts
    
    Fixes #4467.
    
    The syslog tests can fail if the timeout fires before the data arrives at the mock server. Moving the timeout onto the goroutine that is calling ReadFrom() and always processing the data returned before handling the error should improve the reliability of the test.
