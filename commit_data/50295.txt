    cmd/go: don't stamp build or vcs info for GOROOT binaries
    
    Fixes a test failure in cmd/go TestScript/mod_outside.
    
    make.bash (cmd/dist) builds everything with -gcflags=all= -ldflags=all=
    by default. If those no-op flags aren't used, all GOROOT binaries
    appear stale.
    
    It's likely safe to omit those flags in cmd/dist if they're
    empty. Checking out a new commit in GOROOT would always cause
    staleness since the VCS info would change.
    
    For #37475
