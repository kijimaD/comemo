    cmd/dist: apply timeout scale even if timeout isn't overridden
    
    The timeout field is documented as being available so that it's possible
    to override timeout by setting a non-zero value. If it's left at zero,
    we don't need to override the default go test timeout, but we still need
    to apply the timeout scale whenever it's something other than 1.
    
    Fixes (via backport) #61468.
