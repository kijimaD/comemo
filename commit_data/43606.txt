    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: add support for PCALIGN 32
    
    This adds support support for the PCALIGN value 32. When this
    directive occurs code will be aligned to 32 bytes unless
    too many NOPs are needed, and then will fall back to 16
    byte alignment.
    
    On Linux the function's alignment is promoted from 16 to 32
    in functions where PCALIGN 32 appears. On AIX the function's
    alignment is left at 16 due to complexity with modifying its
    alignment, which means code will be aligned to at least 16,
    possibly 32 at times, which is still good.
    
    Test was updated to accept new value.
