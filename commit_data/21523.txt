    runtime: allow fake time writes to both stdout and stderr
    
    In the previous sandbox implementation we read all sandboxed output
    from standard output, and so all fake time writes were made to
    standard output. Now we have a more sophisticated sandbox server
    (see golang.org/x/playground/sandbox) that is capable of recording
    both standard output and standard error, so allow fake time writes to
    go to either file descriptor.
