    syscall: remove nacl srpc helper
    
    Fixes #11961
    
    Minux removed the use of SRPC in 003dccfa, but the SRPC name service
    code was left in the tree. SRPC was removed in pepper_42 making the
    code, which ran on startup, fail, even though it was not used.
    
    Removing srpc_nacl.go for a total diff of -822 lines has got to count
    as one of the easiest nacl fixes we've had to date.
