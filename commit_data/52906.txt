    spec: add missing optional type arguments after TypeName in syntax
    
    Types may be generic, so each occurrence of a TypeName may be
    followed by optional type arguments. Add the missing syntactic
    (EBNF) factor.
    
    The syntax of type names followed by type arguments matches the
    syntax of operand names followed by type arguments (operands may
    also be types, or generic functions, among other things). This
    opens the door to factoring out this shared syntax, but it will
    also require some adjustments to prose to make it work well.
    Leaving for another change.
    
    Fixes #53240.
