    runtime: add specialized copies of growWork and evacuate
    
    The newly added routines are exact copies of the generic routines,
    except for the function names and that growWork_fastX calls evacuate_fastX.
    
    Actual optimization will happen in subsequent CLs.
    This is intended to ease reviewing.
