Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    build with warnings enabled.
    
    new script "quietgcc" installed in $HOME/bin during make.bash
            runs gcc with warnings, turns off inappropriate ones,
            greps out useless output.
    
    quietgcc also makes sure to run the correct 64-bit gcc.
