    net/http: fix incredibly racy TestTransportReading100Continue
    
    Whoops. I'm surprised it even worked before. (Need two pipes,
    not one.)
    
    Also, remove the whole pipe registration business, since it
    wasn't even required in the previous version. (I'd later fixed
    it at the end of send100Response, but forgot to delete it)
