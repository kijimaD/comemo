    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: fix incorrect rejection of legal instructions
    
    "BFI $0, R1, $7, R2" is expected to copy bit 0~6 from R1 to R2, and
    left R2's other bits unchanged.
    
    But the assembler rejects it with error "illegal bit number", and
    BFIW/SBFIZ/SBFIZW/UBFIZ/UBFIZW have the same problem.
    
    This CL fixes that issue and adds corresponding test cases.
    
    fixes #26736
