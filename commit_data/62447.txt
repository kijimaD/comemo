    crypto/elliptic: drop hidden Inverse and CombinedMult methods
    
    These methods were previously used by crypto/ecdsa, but now not even
    ecdsa_legacy.go uses them. Neither were ever documented.
    
    Inverse was available only on P256() and only on amd64 and arm64, so
    hopefully no one used it. CombinedMult was always available on all
    curves, so it's possible some application might have used it, but all
    the samples on GitHub I can find copied the old crypto/ecdsa package,
    which does a conditional interface upgrade with a fallback, so they
    won't break.
