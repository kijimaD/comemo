    runtime: don't re-raise ignored signal
    
    If a signal lands on a non-Go thread, and Go code doesn't want to
    handle it, currently we re-raise the signal in the signal handler
    after uninstalling our handler, so the C code can handle it.
    
    But if there is no C signal handler and the signal is ignored,
    there is no need to re-raise the signal. Just ignore it. This
    avoids uninstalling and reinstalling our handler, which, for some
    reason, changes errno when TSAN is used. And TSAN does not like
    errno being changed in the signal handler.
    
    Not really sure if this is the bset of complete fix, but it does
    fix the immediate problem, and it seems a reasonable thing to do
    by itself.
    
    Test case is CL 581722.
    
    Fixes #66427.
