    syscall: delete asm_windows.s
    
    asm_windows.s contains dummy references of syscall.loadlibrary
    and syscall.getprocaddress, to trigger ABI wrapper/alias
    generation to get ABI0 symbols for them. The comment says they
    are called from assembly in other packages, but I couldn't find
    where. They are defined in Go and only referenced in Go.
    
    CL 179862 removed dummy references in the runtime. This CL
    is similar, for the syscall package.
    
    Also, with CL 306609, they will have ABI0 definitions anyway.
