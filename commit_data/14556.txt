    test: tweak bug273.go to not have constant len < cap when calling make
    
    The current spec says that when calling make, if both len and
    cap are constant, it is an error if len > cap.  The gc
    compiler does not yet implement that, but when it does this
    will need to change.  Changing it now for the benefit of
    gccgo.
