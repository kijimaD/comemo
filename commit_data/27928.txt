    internal/trace: fix analysis of EvGoWaiting/EvGoInSyscall events
    
    When tracing is started in the middle of program execution,
    we already have a number of runnable goroutines and a number
    of blocked/in syscall goroutines. In order to reflect these
    goroutines in the trace, we emit EvGoCreate for all existing
    goroutines. Then for blocked/in syscall goroutines we additionally
    emit EvGoWaiting/EvGoInSyscall events. These events don't reset g.ev
    during trace analysis. So next EvGoStart finds g.ev set to the
    previous EvGoCreate. As the result time between EvGoCreate and
    EvGoStart is accounted as scheduler latency. While in reality
    it is blocking/syscall time.
    
    Properly reset g.ev for EvGoWaiting/EvGoInSyscall events.
