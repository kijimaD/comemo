    cmd/compile/internal/types2: use syntax.EndPos instead of local computation
    
    Previously, the end position for a select statement clause body was
    computed explicitly as the start of the next clause or the closing "}"
    of the select statement, respectively.
    
    Since syntax.EndPos computes the end position of a node, there's no
    need to compute these positions "manually", we can simply use the
    syntax.ExdPos for each clause. The positions are not exactly the
    same as before but for the purpose of identifier visibility in
    scopes there is no semantic change.
    
    Simplifies the code and brings it more in line with go/types.
