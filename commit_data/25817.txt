    testing: pause the test timer while waiting in T.Parallel
    
    Before, we reset the timer at the end of T.Parallel, which is okay
    assuming that T.Parallel is the first thing in the test.
    
    Snapshot the elapsed time at the beginning of Parallel and include it in
    the total duration so that any time spent in the test before calling
    Parallel is reported in the test duration as well.
    
    Updates #12243.
