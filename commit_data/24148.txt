    cmd/vet: diagnose using Printf on a function value
    
    Printing a function value is nearly useless outside of debugging, but
    can occur by mistake when one forgets to call it. Diagnose this.
    
    I did this myself just the other day and it arose in cl/14031.
    Easy to fix and seems worthwhile.
    
    Fixes #12295.
