    os/exec: preserve original order of entries in dedupEnv
    
    Once #50599 is implemented, the entries will be observable via the
    Environ method. I find it confusing for later entries in the list to
    jump arbitrarily far forward based on entries for the same key that no
    longer exist.
    
    This also fixes the deduplication logic for the degenerate Windows
    keys observed in #49886, which were previously deduplicated as empty
    keys.
    
    (It does not do anything about the even-more-degenerate keys observed
    in #52436.)
    
    For #50599.
