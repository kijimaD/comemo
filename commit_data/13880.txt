    vet: fix rangeloop.
    
    In a range loop, the presence of a value implies the presence of a key.
    However, the presence of a value as an *ast.Ident does not imply that
    the key is also an *ast.Ident, thus leading to a panic any time the
    two argument form is used where the key is not an identifier.
