    spec: various clarifications/fixes for method sets and interfaces
    
    - fixed a typo in the method set section
    - express in the syntax that ~T denotes an underlying type
    - be more precise when talking about types vs type terms
    - refer to "unions" rather than "union expressions"
    - make it clear in the spec title that this is WIP
