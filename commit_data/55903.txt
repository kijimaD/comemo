    cmd/go: provide a better error message when there's no go directive
    
    On Go 1.21+ it's an error for a workspace to contain a module with a
    version newer than the workspace's stated go version. If the workspace
    doesn't explicitly have a go version it's explicitly 1.18. So if a
    workspace without a go directive contains a module whose go directive
    is newer on it's always an error for 1.21+. In the error, before this
    CL the error would read "module <path> listed in go.work requires go
    >= <version>, but go.work lists go 1.18". After this change the second
    clause would read "but go.work implicitly requires go 1.18.
    
    Fixes #66207
