    test: fix incorrectly laid out instructions in issue11656.go
    
    CL 279423 introduced a regression in this test as it incorrectly laid
    out various instructions. In the case of arm, the second instruction
    was overwriting the first. In the case of 386, amd64 and s390x, the
    instructions were being appended to the end of the slice after 64
    zero bytes.
    
    This was causing test failures on "linux/s390x on z13".
    
    Fixes #44028
