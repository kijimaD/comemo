    go spec: clean-up and consolidation of spec with implementation
    
    Specifically:
    - introduced notion of "underlying type"
    - removed notion of type compatibility
    - consolidated rules about assignment compatibility in
      assignment compatibility section
    - be consistent with specyfing that nil is the value
      for uninitialized variables that can be nil (this
      was not specified clearly for pointers, functions, interfaces)
    - added/fixed various related links throughout
    - clarify language on conversions
