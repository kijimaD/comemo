 Finally, the go command now supports packages that import Objective-C

+To enable cgo during cross compiling builds, set the CGO_ENABLED
+environment variable to 1 when building the Go tools with make.bash.
+Also, set CC_FOR_TARGET to the C cross compiler for the target.  CC will
+be used for compiling for the host.

+After the Go tools are built, when running the go command, CC_FOR_TARGET is
+ignored.  The value of CC_FOR_TARGET when running make.bash is the default

+to control the compiler when running the go tool.

+CXX_FOR_TARGET works in a similar way for C++ code.
