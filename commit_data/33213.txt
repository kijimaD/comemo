    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: use reverse postorder traversal
    
    Instead of the hand-written control flow analysis in debug info
    generation, use a reverse postorder traversal, which is basically the
    same thing. It should be slightly faster.
    
    More importantly, the previous version simply gave up in the case of
    non-reducible functions, and produced output that caused a later stage
    to crash. It turns out that there's a non-reducible function in
    compress/flate, so that wasn't a theoretical issue.
    
    With this change, all blocks will be visited, even for non-reducible
    functions.
