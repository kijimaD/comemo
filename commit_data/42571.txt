    runtime: ensure arenaBaseOffset makes it into DWARF (for viewcore)
    
    This constant does not make it into DWARF because it is an ideal
    constant larger than maxint (1<<63-1). DWARF has no way to represent
    signed values that large. Define a different typed constant that
    is unsigned and so can represent this constant properly.
    
    Viewcore needs this constant to interrogate the heap data structures.
    In addition, the sign of arenaBaseOffset changed in 1.15, and providing
    a new name lets viewcore detect the sign change easily.
