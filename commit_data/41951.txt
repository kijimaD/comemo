    [dev.link] cmd/internal/dwarf: expand import path in function DIE
    
    Currently, at compile time we emit a function DIE with '"".' in
    the function name, and we expand it at link time, with a really
    ugly function. We can just expand it at compile time instead.
    This way, we don't need to modify the symbol content at link time,
    and also no need to allocate memory for that.
    
    Keep the linker expansion, in case the compiler is invoked
    without the import path.
