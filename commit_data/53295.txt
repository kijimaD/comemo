    cmd/go: quote entries in list-valued variables for go env in plan9
    
    When 'go env' without an argument prints environment variables as
    a script which can be executed by the shell, variables with a
    list value in Plan 9 (such as GOPATH) need to be printed with each
    element enclosed in single quotes in case it contains characters
    significant to the Plan 9 shell (such as ' ' or '=').
    
    For #58508
