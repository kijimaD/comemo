    cmd/compile: search for remaining WB ops from end to beginning
    
    The writebarrier pass processes WB ops from beginning to end,
    replacing them by other values.
    But it also checks whether there are more ops to process
    by walking from beginning to end.
    This is quadratic, so walk from end to beginning instead.
    
    This speeds up compiling the code in issue 13554:
    
    name  old time/op       new time/op       delta
    Pkg         11.9s ± 2%         8.3s ± 3%  -29.88%  (p=0.000 n=18+17)
    
    Updates #13554
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
