    runtime: deflake CGO traceback tests
    
    The CGO traceback function is called whenever CGO code is executing and
    a signal is received. This occurs much more frequently now SIGURG
    is used for preemption.
    
    Disable signal preemption to significantly increase the likelihood that
    a signal results in a profile sample during the test.
    
    Updates #37201
