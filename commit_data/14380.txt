    exp/types: avoid init race in check_test.go.
    
    There was an init race between
            check_test.go:init
            universe.go:def
            use of Universe
    and
            universe.go:init
            creation of Universe
    
    The order in which init funcs are executed in a package is unspecified.
    The test is not currently broken in the golang.org environment
    because the go tool compiles the test with non-test sources before test sources,
    but other environments may, say, sort the source files before compiling,
    and thus trigger this race, causing a nil pointer panic.
