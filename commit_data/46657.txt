    [dev.typeparams] go/types: unify methods in missingMethod
    
    Unify methods in Checker.missingMethod. This code was accidentally
    dropped from the merge, while dropping support for method type
    parameters, but is needed for checking implementations of generic
    interfaces.
    
    Put the logic back, including checks that are only needed for method
    type parameters. It makes the code no simpler to assume that method type
    parameters are disallowed, and we have checks elsewhere that produce
    errors for methods with type parameters.
