    spec: document operations which accept []byte|string constrained types
    
    Pre-1.18, as special cases, the built-in operations append and copy
    accepted strings as second arguments if the first argument was a byte
    slice. With Go 1.18, these two built-ins as well as slice expressions
    rely on the notion of core types in their specification.
    
    Because we want to permit slice expressions, append, and copy to
    operate on (1st or 2nd operands) that are type parameters restricted
    by []byte | string (and variations thereof), the simple notion of
    core type is not sufficient for these three operations. (The compiler
    already permits such more relaxed operations).
    
    In the section on core types, add a paragraph and examples introducing
    the (artificial) core type "bypestring", which describes the core type
    of type sets whose underlying types are []byte or string. Adjust the
    rules for slice expressions, append, and copy accordingly.
    
    Also (unrelated): Adjust prose in the only paragraph where we used
    personal speech ("we") to impersonal speech, to match the rest of
    the spec.
    
    Fixes #52859.
