    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: add support of NOOP instruction
    
    This patch uses symbol NOOP to support arm64 instruction NOP. In
    arm64, NOP stands for that No Operation does nothing, other than
    advance the value of the program counter by 4. This instruction
    can be used for instruction alignment purposes. This patch uses
    NOOP to support arm64 instruction NOP, because we have a generic
    "NOP" instruction, which is a zero-width pseudo-instruction.
    
    In arm64, instruction NOP is an alias of HINT #0. This patch adds
    test cases for instruction HINT #0.
