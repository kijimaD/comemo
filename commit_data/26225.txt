    net/http: update bundled copied of x/net/http2 to git rev 961116aee
    
    Update net/http's copy of http2 (sync as of x/net git rev 961116aee,
    aka https://golang.org/cl/18266)
    
    Also adds some CONNECT tests for #13717 (mostly a copy of http2's
    version of test, but in the main repo it also tests that http1 behaves
    the same)
    
    Fixes #13668
    Fixes #13717
