    encoding/asn1: don't encode strings with '*' as PrintableString.
    
    The '*' character is not allowed in ASN.1 PrintableString. However, due
    to wide-spread use, we permit it so that we can parse many certificates
    with wildcards. However, that also meant that generic strings with
    asterisks in would be encoded as PrintableString.
    
    This change makes the default for such strings to be UTF8String. Thus,
    while the code PrintableStrings containing '*', it will not generate
    them unless the string type was specified in the struct field tag.
