    runtime/race: more precise handling of finalizers
    Currently race detector runtime just disables race detection in the finalizer goroutine.
    It has false positives when a finalizer writes to shared memory -- the race with finalizer is reported in a normal goroutine that accesses the same memory.
    After this change I am going to synchronize the finalizer goroutine with the rest of the world in racefingo(). This is closer to what happens in reality and so
    does not have false positives.
    And also add README file with instructions how to build the runtime.
