    exp/template/html: fix bug in cssEscaper
    
    cssEscaper escapes using the CSS convention: `\` + hex + optional-space
    
    It outputs the space when the escape could be followed by
    a hex digit to distinguish a "\na" from "\u00aa".
    
    It did not output a space when the escape is followed by a space
    character so did not distinguish "\n " from "\n".
    
    Currently when doing lookahead, it does not distinguish spaces that
    will be escaped later by the same function from ones that will not.
    This is correct but suboptimal.
