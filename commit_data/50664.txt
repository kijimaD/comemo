    runtime: use correct constant when computing nsec remainder
    
    A code comment on amd64 for windows and plan9 contained a snippet for
    splitting apart the sec and nsec components of a unix timestamp, with
    produced assembly below, which was then cleaned up by hand. When arm64
    was ported, that code snippet in the comment went through the compiler
    to produce some code that was then pasted and cleaned up. Unfortunately,
    the comment had a typo in it, containing 8 zeros instead of 9.
    
    This resulted in the constant used in the assembly being wrong, spotted
    by @bufflig's eagle eyes. So, this commit fixes the comment on all three
    platforms, and the assembly on windows/arm64.
    
    Fixes #48072.
