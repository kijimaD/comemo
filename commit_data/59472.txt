    cmd/link: use >4GB base address for 64-bit PE binaries
    
    Windows prefers 64-bit binaries to be loaded at an address above 4GB.
    
    Having a preferred base address below this boundary triggers a
    compatibility mode in Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) on
    recent versions of Windows that reduces the number of locations to which
    ASLR may relocate the binary.
    
    The Go internal linker was using a smaller base address due to an issue
    with how dynamic cgo symbols were relocated, which has been fixed in
    this CL.
    
    Fixes #73561.
