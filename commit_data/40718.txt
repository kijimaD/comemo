    crypto/tls: add ExampleConfig_VerifyPeerCertificate
    
    Setting InsecureSkipVerify and VerifyPeerCertificate is the recommended
    way to customize and override certificate validation.
    
    However, there is boilerplate involved and it usually requires first
    reimplementing the default validation strategy to then customize it.
    Provide an example that does the same thing as the default as a starting
    point.
    
    Examples of where we directed users to do something similar are in
    issues #35467, #31791, #28754, #21971, and #24151.
    
    Fixes #31792
