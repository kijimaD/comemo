    cmd/compile: convert some Phis into And8.
    
    See discussion at [1]. True value must have a fixed non-zero
    representation meaning that a && b can be implemented as a & b.

    This change helps with m := a && b, but it's more common to see
    if a && b { do something } which is not handled.
