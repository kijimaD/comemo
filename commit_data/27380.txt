    cmd/trace: split large traces into parts
    
    Trace viewer cannot handle traces larger than 256MB (limit on js string size):
    https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/issues/627
    And even that is problematic (chrome hangs and crashes).
    Split large traces into 100MB parts. Somewhat clumsy, but I don't see any other
    solution (other than rewriting trace viewer). At least it works reliably now.
    
    Fixes #15482
