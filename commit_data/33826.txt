    cmd/compile: fix bug in logic for computing var abstract origins
    
    The DWARF inline info generation code was using file/line/column (from
    src.Pos) as a means of matching up pre- and post-optimization variable
    nodes. This turns out to be problematic since it looks as though
    distinct formals on the same line can be assigned the same column
    number. Work around this issue by adding variable names to the
    disambiguation code. Added a testpoint to the linker DWARF test that
    checks to make sure each abstract origin offset of distinct within a
    given DWARF DW_AT_inlined_routine body.
    
    Fixes #23020.
