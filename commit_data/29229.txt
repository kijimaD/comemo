    net/http/httputil: remove proxied headers mentioned in connection-tokens
    
    RFC 2616, section 14.10 says:
    
    >>>
    HTTP/1.1 proxies MUST parse the Connection header field before a message
    is forwarded and, for each connection-token in this field, remove any
    header field(s) from the message with the same name as the
    connection-token. Connection options are signaled by the presence of a
    connection-token in the Connection header field, not by any
    corresponding additional header field(s), since the additional header
    field may not be sent if there are no parameters associated with that
    connection option.
    <<<
    
    The same requirement was included in RFC 7230, section 6.1.
    
    Fixes #16875
