    go/types, types2: add missing Unalias calls (clarification)
    
    This change adds an Unalias call in applyTypeFunc and arrayPtrDeref.
    At the moment this doesn't change anything or fix any bugs because
    of the way these two functions are invoked, but that could change
    in the future.
    
    Also, manually reviewed all type assertions to Type types.
    
    Excluding assertions to type parameters, no obvious issues
    were found except for #67540 for which a separate fix is pending.
    
    There are potential issues with assertions type parameters
    which will be addressed in a follow-up CL.
    
    For #67547.
