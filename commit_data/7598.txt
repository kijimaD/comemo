commit 966bf71366019dc608d22128400483bf44c1055c
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 1 13:54:22 2011 -0800

    docs: make "runtime" a word only as a name for the package.
    
    Computer people have an agglutinating streak that I like to resist.
    As a time of execution: run time.
    As an adjective: run-time.
    As a noun: run-time support/code/library.
    
    Signed,
    Mr. Pedant.
