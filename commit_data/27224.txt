    runtime: generalize work.finalizersDone to work.markrootDone
    
    We're about to add another root marking job that needs to happen only
    during the first markroot pass (whether that's concurrent or STW),
    just like finalizer scanning. Rather than introducing another flag
    that has the same value as finalizersDone, just rename finalizersDone
    to markrootDone.
