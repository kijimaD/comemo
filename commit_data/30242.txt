    net/http: document Response.Header values that are subordinate to other fields
    
    I noticed that Content-Length may appear in http.Response.Header, but the docs
    say it should be omitted.  Per discussion with bradfitz@, updating the docs to
    indicate that the struct fields are authoritative.
