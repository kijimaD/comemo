+Package comment implements parsing and reformatting of Go doc comments,
+(documentation comments), which are comments that immediately precede
+a top-level declaration of a package, const, func, type, or var.
+
+Go doc comment syntax is a simplified subset of Markdown that supports
+links, headings, paragraphs, lists (without nesting), and preformatted text blocks.
+The details of the syntax are documented at https://go.dev/doc/comment.
+
+To parse the text associated with a doc comment (after removing comment markers),
+use a [Parser]:
+
+	var p comment.Parser
+	doc := p.Parse(text)
+
+The result is a [*Doc].
+To reformat it as a doc comment, HTML, Markdown, or plain text,
+use a [Printer]:
+
+	var pr comment.Printer
+	os.Stdout.Write(pr.Text(doc))
+
+The [Parser] and [Printer] types are structs whose fields can be
+modified to customize the operations.
+For details, see the documentation for those types.
+
+Use cases that need additional control over reformatting can
+implement their own logic by inspecting the parsed syntax itself.
+See the documentation for [Doc], [Block], [Text] for an overview
+and links to additional types.
