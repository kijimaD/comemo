    cmd/compile: tighten for huge functions in -N mode
    
    Currently, in -N mode we skip the tighten pass. However, for very
    large functions, many values live across blocks can cause
    pathological behavior in the register allocator, which could use
    a huge amount of memory or cause the program to hang. For
    functions that large, debugging using a debugger is unlikely to be
    very useful (the function is probably generated anyway). So we do
    a little optimization to make fewer values live across blocks and
    make it easier for the compiler.
    
    Fixes #52180.
