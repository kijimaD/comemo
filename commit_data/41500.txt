    cmd/gofmt, go/format: sync internal.go
    
    Apply CL 40930 to src/cmd/gofmt/internal.go to bring
    it into sync with src/go/format/internal.go.
    
    Also revert '\n' back to "\n\n" in one of the comments,
    because the previous text was more accurate.
    Gofmt replaces the "; " part of "package p; func _() {"
    input with two newline characters, not one.
    
    Updates #11844
