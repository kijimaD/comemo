    doc/go1.20: remove mention of arena goexperiment
    
    The arena goexperiment contains code used inside Google in very
    limited use cases that we will maintain, but the discussion on #51317
    identified serious problems with the very idea of adding arenas to the
    standard library. In particular the concept tends to infect many other
    APIs in the name of efficiency, a bit like sync.Pool except more
    publicly visible.
    
    It is unclear when, if ever, we will pick up the idea and try to push
    it forward into a public API, but it's not going to happen any time
    soon, and we don't want users to start depending on it: it's a true
    experiment and may be changed or deleted without warning.
    
    The arena text in the release notes makes them seem more official
    and supported than they really are, and we've already seen a couple
    blog posts based on that erroneous belief. Delete the text to try to
    set expectations better.
