    test/codegen: port math/bits.RotateLeft tests to codegen
    
    Only RotateLeft{64,32} were tested, and just for ppc64. This CL adds
    tests for RotateLeft{64,32,16,8} on arm64 and amd64/386, for the cases
    where the calls are actually instrinsified.
    
    RotateLeft tests (the last ones for math/bits functions) are deleted
    from asm_test.
    
    This CL also adds a space between the "//" and the arch name in the
    comments, to uniform this file to the style used in all the other
    files.
