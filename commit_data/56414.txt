    internal/coverage/encodecounter: followup changes from code review
    
    This patch contains a small set of changes with fixes for some
    issues that surfaced during the code review for CL 484535. Due
    to an error on my part, these never got included in the final version
    that was checked in (I rebased, mailed the rebase, but then never
    mailed the final patch set with the changes). This patch sends
    the remaining bits and pieces.
    
    Updates #59563.
