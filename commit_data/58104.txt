    cmd/go/internal/fsys: add Bind to add bind mounts
    
    fsys.Bind(repl, dir) makes the virtual file system
    redirect any references to dir to use repl instead.
    In Plan 9 terms, it binds repl onto dir.
    In Linux terms, it does a mount --bind of repl onto dir.
    Or think of it as being like a symlink dir -> repl being
    added to the virtual file system.
    
    This is a separate layer from the overlay so that editors
    working in the replacement directory can still apply
    their own replacements within that tree, and also so
    that editors working in the original dir do not have any
    effect at all.
    
    (If the binds and the overlay were in the same sorted list,
    we'd have problems with keeping the relative priorities
    of individual entries correct.)
