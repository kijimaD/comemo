    [dev.typeparams] go/types: trigger verification while resolving instance
    
    The refactoring of CL 335929 to merge the instance and Named types
    resulted in type instances only being evaluated once. As a side effect,
    we only verified constraints once per unique instantiation expression.
    
    This can be confusing if type instantations are occurring far apart in
    the code. Resolve this by lifting up the verification logic into
    Instantiate and InstantiateLazy.
