    cmd/compile: fix recursive generic interface instantiation
    
    When shapifying recursive instantiated types, the compiler ends up
    leaving the type as-is if it already has been a shape type. However, if
    both of type arguments are interfaces, and one of them is a recursive
    one, it ends up being shaped as-is, while the other is shaped to its
    underlying, causing mismatch in function signature.
    
    Fixing this by shapifying an interface type as-is, if it is fully
    instantiated and already been a shape type.
    
    Fixes #65362
    Fixes #66663
