    crypto/tls: cache Leaf certificate during BuildNameToCertificate
    
    I am working on a TLS server program, which issues new TLS certificates
    on demand. The new certificates will be added into tls.Config.Certificates.
    BuildNameToCertificate will be called to refresh the name table afterwards.
    This change will reduce some workload on existing certificates.
    
    Note that you canâ€™t modify the Certificates field (or call BuildNameToCertificate)
    on a Config in use by a Server. You can however modify an unused Config that gets
    cloned in GetConfigForClient with appropriate locking.
