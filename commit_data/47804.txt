    cmd/compile: look for newobject in register ABI for write barrier elision
    
    If we are assigning a global address to an object that is
    immediately returned from runtime.newobject, we omit the write
    barrier because we know that both the source (static address) and
    the destination (zeroed memory) do not need to be tracked by the
    GC. Currently, the code that matches runtime.newobject's result
    is specific to ABI0 layout. Update the code to work with register
    ABI as well.
