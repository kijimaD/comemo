    encoding/asn1: enforce use of short form lengths.
    
    BER allows the sender to choose either short form or long form where
    both are legal, but DER requires the minimal one be used. Enforce this
    and add a test. Fix one test which was not minimally-encoded and another
    which would not distinguish rejecting the input because the long form
    length wasn't minimally-encoded from rejecting it because long form was
    chosen when short form was allowed.
