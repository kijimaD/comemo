    internal/zstd: fix seek offset bounds check in skipFrame
    
    This change enhances the zstd Reader's skipFrame function to validate
    the new offset when skipping frames in a seekable stream, preventing
    invalid offsets that could occur previously.
    
    A set of "bad" test strings has been added to fuzz_test.go to extend
    the robustness checks against potential decompression panics.
    
    Additionally, a new test named TestReaderBad is introduced in
    zstd_test.go to verify proper error handling with corrupted input
    strings.
    
    The BenchmarkLarge function has also been refactored for clarity,
    removing unnecessary timer stops and resets.
