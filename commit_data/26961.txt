    cmd/compile: remove dead flags
    
    For some time now, the -d flag has been used to control various named
    debug options, rather than setting Debug['d']. Consequently, that
    means dflag() always returns false, which means the -y flag is also
    useless.
    
    Similarly, Debug['L'] is never used anywhere, so the -L flag can be
    dropped too.
