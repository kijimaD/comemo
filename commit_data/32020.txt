    cmd/internal/obj/arm: support more ARMv5/ARMv6/ARMv7 instructions
    
    REV/REV16/REVSH were introduced in ARMv6, they offered more efficient
    byte reverse operatons.
    
    MMUL/MMULA/MMULS were introduced in ARMv6, they simplified
    a serial of mul->shift->add/sub operations into a single instruction.
    
    RBIT was introduced in ARMv7, it inversed a 32-bit word's bit order.
    
    MULS was introduced in ARMv7, it corresponded to MULA.
    
    MULBB/MULABB were introduced in ARMv5TE, they performed 16-bit
    multiplication (and accumulation).
