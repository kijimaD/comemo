    encoding/json: get rid of the stream_test.go TODOs
    
    TestRawMessage now passes without the need for the RawMessage field to
    be a pointer. The TODO dates all the way back to 2010, so I presume the
    issue has since been fixed.
    
    TestNullRawMessage tested the decoding of a JSON null into a
    *RawMessage. The existing behavior was correct, but for the sake of
    completeness a non-pointer RawMessage field has been added too. The
    non-pointer field behaves differently, as one can read in the docs:
    
            To unmarshal JSON into a value implementing the Unmarshaler
            interface, Unmarshal calls that value's UnmarshalJSON method,
            including when the input is a JSON null.
