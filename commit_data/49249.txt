    go/types, types2: set an origin object for vars and funcs
    
    Historically, Objects in go/types were canonical, meaning each entity
    was represented by exactly one variable and could thus be identified by
    its address. With object instantiation this is no longer the case: Var
    and Func objects must be copied to hold substituted type information,
    and there may be more than one Var or Func variable representing the
    same source-level entity.
    
    This CL adds Origin methods to *Var and *Func, so users can efficiently
    navigate to the corresponding canonical object on the generic type.
    
    Fixes #51682
