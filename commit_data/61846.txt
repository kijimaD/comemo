 ## Runtime {#runtime}

+<!-- go.dev/issue/54766 -->
+<!-- go.dev/cl/614795 -->
+<!-- go.dev/issue/68578 -->
+
+Several performance improvements to the runtime have decreased CPU overheads by
+2â€”3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks.
+Results may vary by application.
+These improvements include a new builtin `map` implementation based on
+[Swiss Tables](https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables), more efficient
+memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
+implementation.
+
+The new builtin `map` implementation and new runtime-internal mutex may be
+disabled by setting `GOEXPERIMENT=noswissmap` and `GOEXPERIMENT=nospinbitmutex`
+at build time respectively.

+The implementation of [sync.Map] has been changed, improving overall performance
+and resolving some long-standing issues.
+If you encounter any problems, set `GOEXPERIMENT=nosynchashtriemap` at build
+time to switch back to the old implementation and please [file an
+issue](/issue/new).
