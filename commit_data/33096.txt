    runtime: delay before osRelaxing
    
    Currently, sysmon relaxes the Windows timer resolution as soon as the
    Go process becomes idle. However, if it's going idle because of a
    short sleep (< 15.6 ms), this can turn that short sleep into a long
    sleep (15.6 ms).
    
    To address this, wait for 60 ms of idleness before relaxing the timer
    resolution. It would be better to check the time until the next wakeup
    and relax immediately if it makes sense, but there's currently no
    interaction between sysmon and the timer subsystem, so adding this
    simple delay is a much simpler and safer change for late in the
    release cycle.
    
    Fixes #20937.
