    cmd/link: deprecate -X name value in favor of -X name=value
    
    People invoking the linker directly already have to change their scripts
    to use the new "go tool link", so this is a good time to make the -X flag
    behave like all other Go flags and take just a single argument.
    
    The old syntax will continue to be accepted (it is rewritten into the new
    syntax before flag parsing). Maybe some day we will be able to retire it.
    
    Even if we never retire the old syntax, having the new syntax at least
    makes the rewriting much less of a kludge.
