commit 11c1aa9f6d5d73ea75ad01eba054cee47dc7c621
Author: David G. Andersen <dave.andersen@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 12:39:37 2009 -0800

    Adding my name to authors/contributors.  I'm waiting to hear
    back from Carnegie Mellon about whether they're interested in
    signing the agreement (do you know if they have already?).
    In the meantime, I'm submitting these changes on my own time.
    If CMU has already signed the corporate contributor agreement,
    please remove my name from the AUTHORS list.
