    cmd/internal/obj/x86: don't apply workaround for solaris to darwin
    
    Currently, we have a workaround for solaris that enforce aboslute
    addressing for external symbols. However, We don't want to use the
    workaround for darwin.
    This CL also refactors code a little bit, because the original function
    name is not appropriate now.
    
    Updates #17490
