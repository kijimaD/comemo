    unicode: add CategoryAliases, Cn, LC
    
    CategoryAliases is for regexp to use, for things like \p{Letter} as an alias for \p{L}.
    Cn and LC are special-case categories that were never implemented
    but should have been.
    
    These changes were generated by the updated generator in CL 641395.
    
    Fixes #70780.
