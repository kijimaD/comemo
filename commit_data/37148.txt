    cmd/link: split off 'Dynimp' string fields to reduce sym.Symbol size
    
    The linker's sym.Symbol struct contains two string fields, "Dynimplib"
    and "Dynimpvers" that are used only in very specific circumstances
    (for many symbols, such as DWARF syms, they are wasted space). Split
    these two off into a separate struct, then point to an instance of
    that struct when needed. This reduces the size of sym.Symbol so as to
    save space in the common case.
    
    Updates #26186
