    slices: for Insert and Replace, grow slices like append does
    
    At least when we're inserting/replacing near the end of a slice, when
    we have to grow it use the same multiplicative growth factor that the
    runtime uses for append.
    
    Before this CL, we would grow the slice one page (8192 bytes) at a time
    for large slices. This would cause O(n^2) work when appending near the
    end should only take O(n) work.
    
    This doesn't fix the problem if you insert/replace near the start of the
    array, but maybe that doesn't need fixing because it is O(n^2) anyway.
    
    Fixes #60134
