    doc: improve issue template and contribution guidelines
    
    Encourage people towards the various help forums as a first port of
    call. Better sign-posting will reduce the incidence or questions being
    asked in the issue tracker that should otherwise be handled elsewhere,
    thereby keeping the issue tracker email traffic more focussed.
