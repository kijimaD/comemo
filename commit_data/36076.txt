    cmd/compile: improve declaration position precision
    
    Previously, n.Pos was reassigned to lineno when declare was called,
    which might not match where the identifier actually appeared in the
    source. This caused a loss of position precision for function
    parameters (which were all declared at the last parameter's position),
    and required some clumsy workarounds in bimport.go.
    
    This CL changes declare to leave n.Pos alone and also fixes a few
    places where n.Pos was not being set correctly.
