    runtime: allow OutputDebugString to be sent to debugger
    
    We mark DBG_PRINTEXCEPTION_C messages in VEH handler
    as handled, thus preventing debugger from seeing them.
    I don't see reason for doing that. The comment warns
    of crashes, but I added test and don't see any crashes.
    
    This is also simplify VEH handler before making
    changes to fix issue 8006.
    
    Update #8006
