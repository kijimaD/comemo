    cmd/go: clean up "cover" debug output
    
    Currently, the two places that run the cover tool manually construct a
    terse command description. However, this actually prevents Builder.run
    from constructing a more detailed description from the actual command
    being run. Fix this by passing "" as the description to get the
    default behavior.
