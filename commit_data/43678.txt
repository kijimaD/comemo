    [dev.link] cmd/link: revise representation of dwarfp
    
    Change linker DWARF generation to move away from emitting a single
    giant list of DWARF symbols, and instead emit a list of descriptors,
    with each descriptor holding the symbols for a specific DWARF section.
    
    While placing all DWARF symbols in a single lists does come in handy
    in certain instances, it also creates a lot of confusion and weird
    code in other cases, specifically where we want to perform operations
    on a section-by-section basis (resulting in code that tries to
    re-discover section boundaries by walking/inspecting the list).
