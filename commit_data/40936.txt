    doc: add CherryPickApproved filter to Release History links
    
    Not all closed issues in a given minor milestone are included in that
    release, only the ones that have been labeled as CherryPickApproved are.
    
    Update the links to the GitHub issue tracker to include a filter on the
    CherryPickApproved label, so that the default view shows only the
    backports that were included in a given release. This should more useful
    to most people than seeing all backports (considered and approved).
    
    Do this only for Go 1.9.1 and newer releases, as that is when we started
    using the CherryPickCandidate and CherryPickApproved labels.
    
    Fixes #35988
