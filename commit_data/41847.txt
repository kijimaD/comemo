    go/ast: fix SortImports to handle block comments (take 2)
    
    This is a 2nd attempt at fixing CL 162337 which had an off-by-one error.
    We were unconditionally getting the position of the start of the next line
    from the last import without checking whether it is the end of the file or not.
    
    Fix the code to check for that and move the testcase added in CL 190523
    to the end of the file for it to trigger the issue properly.
    
    Fixes #18929
