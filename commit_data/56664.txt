    cmd/go,testdeps: move import of internal/coverage/cfile to testmain
    
    Instead of having testing/internal/testdeps import the
    internal/coverage/cfile package directly, have the code in testmain
    pass in pointers to cfile functions during setup in the case that
    we're running a "go test -cover" binary. This reduces the size of
    regular non-coverage test binaries back to what they were before CL
    585820.
    
    Updates #67401.
    Fixes #67588.
