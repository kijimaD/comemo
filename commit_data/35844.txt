    go/token: add example for retrieving Position from Pos
    
    There are few uses for the majority of the API in go/token for the
    average user. The exception to this is getting the filename, line, and
    column information from a token.Pos (reported and absolute. This is
    straightforward but figuring out how to do it requires combing through
    a lot of documentation. This example makes it more easily discoverable.
    
    Updates #24352.
