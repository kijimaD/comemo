    cmd/go: use Bitbucket v2 REST API when determining VCS
    
    The existing implementation uses v1.0 of Bitbucket's REST API. The newer
    version 2.0 of Bitbucket's REST API provides the same information but
    with support for partial responses allowing the client to request only
    the response fields that are relevant to their usage of the API
    resulting in a much smaller payload size.
    
    The partial response functionality in the Bitbucket API is documented here:
    https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/partial-response
    
    The v2.0 of the Bitbucket repositories API is documented here:
    https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Busername%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D#get
    
    Fixes #18919
