    net: work around Solaris connect issue when server closes socket
    
    On Solaris, if you do a in-progress connect, and then the
    server accepts and closes the socket, the client's later
    attempt to complete the connect will fail with EINVAL.  Handle
    this case by assuming that the connect succeeded.  This code
    is weird enough that it is implemented as Solaris-only so that
    it doesn't hide a real error on a different OS.
    
    Update #6828
