    doc/contribute.html: adjust wording from previous CL
    
    The previous CL, 107197, overclarified the need for short subject
    lines. Tweak the wording to be a guideline (keep it short) rather
    than a limit (76 characters), which is more the Go way.
    
    Also be strict about avoiding markup language.
