    runtime: allocate crash stack via stackalloc
    
    On some platforms (notably OpenBSD), stacks must be specifically allocated
    and marked as being stack memory. Allocate the crash stack using stackalloc,
    which ensures these requirements are met, rather than using a global Go
    variable.
    
    Fixes #63794
