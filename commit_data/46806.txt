    internal/fuzz: log that minimization is occurring
    
    Previously, when fuzzing for a period of time, the
    command line output would look something like this:
    
       fuzz: minimizing 34995-byte crash input...
       fuzz: elapsed: 3s, execs: 13821 (4604/sec), new interesting: 0 (total: 1)
       fuzz: elapsed: 6s, execs: 13821 (2303/sec), new interesting: 0 (total: 1)
       fuzz: elapsed: 9s, execs: 13821 (1535/sec), new interesting: 0 (total: 1)
       --- FAIL: FuzzFoo (9.05s)
    
    This is the same output it has while fuzzing, so if
    minimization runs for a long time (default allows 1
    minute), then it looks like minimization is hanging.
    It's also confusing that the execs/sec would continually
    decrease.
    
    Now, when minimization is running, the command line
    output will look something like this:
    
       fuzz: minimizing 34995-byte crash input...
       fuzz: elapsed: 3s, minimizing
       fuzz: elapsed: 6s, minimizing
       fuzz: elapsed: 9s, minimizing
       fuzz: elapsed: 9s, minimizing
       --- FAIL: FuzzFoo (9.05s)
    
    The final "fuzz: elapsed: 6s, minimizing" could be
    printed twice because we always print one final log
    to the command line before we exit.
