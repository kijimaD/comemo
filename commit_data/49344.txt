    cmd/compile/internal/types2: use the orig object for Named.Obj
    
    Exposing a synthetic type name for instantiated types is problematic:
    there is no way to ensure that type instances are first created in the
    same type checking pass, and therefore no guarantee that their
    instantiation positions are the same. Even type checking a given package
    with different file ordering could result in different positions being
    associated with type instances. This is therefore an implementation
    detail that we should not expose.
    
    Keep the synthetic type name for accurate error reporting, but hide it
    in the API.
