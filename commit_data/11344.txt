    go/build: add BuildTags to Context, allow !tag
    
    This lets the client of go/build specify additional tags that
    can be recognized in a // +build directive.  For example,
    a build for a custom environment like App Engine might
    include "appengine" in the BuildTags list, so that packages
    can be written with some files saying
    
            // +build appengine   (build only on app engine)
    
    or
    
            // +build !appengine  (build only when NOT on app engine)
    
    App Engine here is just a hypothetical context.  I plan to use
    this in the cmd/go sources to distinguish the bootstrap version
    of cmd/go (which will not use networking) from the full version
    using a custom tag.  It might also be useful in App Engine.
    
    Also, delete Build and Script, which we did not end up using for
    cmd/go and which never got turned on for real in goinstall.
