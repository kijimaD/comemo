    cmd/compile: avoid generating large offsets
    
    The assembler barfs on large offsets. Make sure that all the
    instructions that need to have their offsets in an int32
      1) check on any rule that computes offsets for such instructions
      2) change their aux fields so the check builder checks it.
    
    The assembler also silently misassembled offsets between 1<<31
    and 1<<32. Add a check in the assembler to barf on those as well.
    
    Fixes #21655
