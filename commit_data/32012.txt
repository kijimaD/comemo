    cmd/link: make mach-o dwarf segment properly aligned
    
    Without this, the load fails during kernel exec, which results in the
    mysterious and completely uninformative "Killed: 9" error.
    
    It appears that the stars (or at least the inputs) were properly aligned
    with earlier versions of Xcode so that this happened accidentally.
    Make it happen on purpose.
    
    Gregory Man bisected the breakage to this change in LLVM,
    which fits the theory nicely:

    Fixes #19734.
