    runtime: remove debugCachedWork
    
    debugCachedWork and all of its dependent fields and code were added to
    aid in debugging issue #27993. Now that the source of the problem is
    known and mitigated (via the extra work check after STW in gcMarkDone),
    these extra checks are no longer required and simply make the code more
    difficult to follow.
    
    Remove it all.
    
    Updates #27993
