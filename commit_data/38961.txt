    runtime: pass LR to sigprof on windows/arm
    
    TestCPUProfileLabel was failing on windows/arm because the link register
    was not being passed to sigprof(). The link register is required to
    generate a correct traceback. With this change, all tests in runtime.pprof
    are now passing.
