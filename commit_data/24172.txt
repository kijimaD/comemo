    cmd/internal/obj: fix pc/sp information for prologue
    
    When the prologue call to morestack was moved down to the
    bottom of the function, the pc/sp tables were not updated.
    If a traceback through a call to morestack is needed, it would
    get confused at and stop at morestack.
    
    Confirmed the fix by adding //go:systemstack (which calls
    morestackc, but same issue) where it did not belong
    and inspecting the crash.
