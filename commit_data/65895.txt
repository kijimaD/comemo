commit 705b5a569acb9207fda8ea469387d88346b6817a

    crypto/ecdsa: drop SEC 1 reference from package doc
    
    FIPS 186-4 used to defer to ANSI X9.62-2005, which is not freely
    available, so we were referring to SEC 1 instead. Our new reference,
    FIPS 186-5, actually specifies the full algorithm, so there is no need
    to refer to SEC 1 anymore.
