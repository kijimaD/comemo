    cmd/compile: adjust RISCV64 rewrite rules to use typed aux fields
    
    Also add a typed version of mergeSym to rewrite.go to assist with a few
    rules that used mergeSym in the untyped-form.
    
    Remove a few extra int32 overflow checks that no longer make sense, as
    adding two int8s or int16s should never overflow an int32.
    
    Passes toolstash-check -all.
