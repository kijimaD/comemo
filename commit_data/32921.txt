    time: enable ZONEINFO tzdata file support and error reporting
    
    Loading location data from tzdata files was only supported
    from default paths on android. This change enables support on
    all OS via the ZONEINFO environment variable and reduces the
    amount of android specific code significantly.
    Furthermore, unsuccessful calls to LoadLocation now return the
    first error encountered, including errors from attempting to
    load a location from the source specified by ZONEINFO.
    Errors indicating that the source or location was not found are
    ignored until all possible sources have been traversed.
