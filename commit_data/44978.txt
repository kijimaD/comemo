    runtime: expand gopark documentation
    
    unlockf is called after the G is put into _Gwaiting, meaning another G
    may have readied this one before unlockf is called.
    
    This is implied by the current doc, but add additional notes to call out
    this behavior, as it can be quite surprising.
