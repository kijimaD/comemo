    cmd/link: enhance linker's dwarf test
    
    Couple of changes to the linker's dwarf test, including:
    
     - add some code to the DWARF tests inlining coverage to verify the
       call_file attribute attached to inlined routine DIEs. If function
       main.F is inlined into function main.G, we want to see that the
       call_file attribute in the inlined routine DIE for main.F is the
       same file as that reported for main.G.
    
     - fix a glitch with the way the DW_AT_decl_file attribute was
       being checked. The previous code relied on hard-coded indices
       into the line table files table, which is very brittle (since
       there is no requirement that files be ordered in any specific
       way). Instead, add machinery to look up the actual file string
       via the line table reader.
