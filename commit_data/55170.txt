    runtime/pprof: retry vmmap invocation if it failed due to a reported temporary resource shortage
    
    As per #62352 the invocation of vmmap may fail (very rarely) due to
    a temporary lack of resources on the test runner machine. This PR
    allows for retrying the invocation a fixed number of times before
    giving up. This is because we suspect the failure is due to
    sensible to retry.
    
    Fixes: #62352
