    cmd/link: update -T flag's documentation
    
    The -T flag actually means the start address of text symbols, not
    the text sections, which may differ by the header size. It has
    been behaving like this since at least 2009. Make it clear in the
    documentation.
    
    Also remove the -D flag from the doc. The flag doesn't actually
    exist in the implementation.
    
    Fixes #58727.
