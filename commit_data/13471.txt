    build: add few tests with GOMAXPROCS=32 to run.bash
    Some class of bugs (data races, runtime bugs) can be found
    only with real parallelism.
    Note that GOMAXPROCS=32 is somewhat different from go test -cpu=32,
    this intentionally uses GOMAXPROCS to stress program bootstrap,
    testing code, garbage collections, etc.
    Package selection is mostly random.
