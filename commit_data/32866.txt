    syscall: make windows Exit call runtime.exit
    
    Both runtime.exit and syscall.Exit call Windows ExitProcess.
    But recently (CL 34616) runtime.exit was changed to ignore
    Windows CreateThread errors if ExitProcess is called.
    
    This CL adjusts syscall.Exit to do the same.
    
    Fixes #18253 (maybe)
