    dist: add clang specific -Wno options
    
    Clang 3.1 has more warnings enabled by default than GCC.
    Combined with -Werror, they cause the build to fail
    unnecessarily.  if the name of our compiler ends in "clang",
    add the necessary extra -Wno options.  Ideally we would add
    these flags unconditionally, as GCC is supposed to ignore
    unknown -Wno flags, but apple's llvm-gcc doesn't.
    
    Fixes #2878.
