    test: use the version of Go used to run run.go
    
    Currently, the top-level testsuite always uses whatever version
    of Go is found in the PATH to execute all the tests. This
    forces the developers to tweak the PATH to run the testsuite.
    
    Change it to use the same version of Go used to run run.go.
    This allows developers to run the testsuite using the tip
    compiler by simply saying "../bin/go run run.go".
    
    I think this is a better solution compared to always forcing
    "../bin/go", because it allows developers to run the testsuite
    using different Go versions, for instance to check if a new
    test is fixed in tip compared to the installed compiler.
    
    Fixes #24217
