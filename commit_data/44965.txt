    cmd/compile: generate late-lowering static calls
    
    This is testing for the limited case of zero or one SSA-able results.
    
    One regression is that the later expansion of "Dereference" into
    Move into argument slots thwarts the
      MOVE A -> B, MOVE B -> C
    replaced-by
      MOVE A -> B, MOVE A -> C
    optimization; the second move is written instead as a Dereference at the
    phase where the optimization occurs, and because the target of the
    dereference is not visible in the dereference, it's not possible to verify
    that A and B or A and C don't overlap in some peculiar way (and for results
    fed to args, they can).
    
    Regression is repaired in a later CL by changing when calls are expanded.
