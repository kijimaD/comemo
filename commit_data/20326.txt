    runtime: paste mprof.goc into mprof.go as comments
    
    NO CODE CHANGES HERE
    
    The first conversion was not complete.
    This CL doesn't make any actual changes,
    but it inserts the missing mprof.goc code
    as comments so that the next CL will have
    useful diffs.
    
    To make the diffs a bit more useful, removed
    all semicolons, ->, and runtimeÂ· prefixes as well.
    
    Also corrected order of a few functions in mprof.go
    to match original order in mprof.goc.
