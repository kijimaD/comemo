          poly1305: don't move R13 in sum_arm.s.
    
          Rather than change the value of R13 during the execution, keep R13 fixed
          (after the initial prelude) and always use offsets from it.
    
          This should help the runtime figure out what's going on if, say, a
          signal should occur while running this code.
    
          I've also trimmed the set of saved registers since Go doesn't require
          the callee to maintain anything except R10 and R13.
