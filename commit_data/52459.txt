    internal/singleflight: move Done call in TestForgetUnshared
    
    Prior to this change, there was a possibility that the call of ForgetUnshared at line 134 could acquire the lock first.
    Then, after ForgetUnshared released the lock, the doCall function could acquire it and complete its call.
    This change prevents this situation by ensuring that ForgetUnshared at line 134 only executes after doCall has finished executing and released the lock.
