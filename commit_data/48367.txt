    net/url: add OmitHost bool to url.URL
    
    Previously, myscheme:/path and myscheme:///path were treated as the same URL
    although materially different. The distinction made clear by RFC 3986 sec. 5.3 where
    a different recomposition behavior is expected when a URI reference has an undefined
    host(authority) as in myscheme:/path vs. one with an empty host(authority)
    as in myscheme:///path.
    
    This change fixes the Parse/String roundtrip limitation for URLs with an undefined
    host and a single slash.
    
    Fixes #46059
