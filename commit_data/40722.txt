    cmd/link: revise previous __DWARF segment protection fix
    
    Tweak the previous fix for issue 32673 (in CL 182958) to work around
    problems with c-shared build mode that crop up on some of the builders
    (10.11, 10.12).  We now consistently set vmaddr and vmsize to zero
    for the DWARF segment regardless of build mode.
    
    Updates #32673
