    go/types: fix method set computation
    
    When computing method sets, any struct field that "shadows" a
    method at a lower embedding level eliminates that method from
    the method set. Treat any field at a given level as a "collision"
    for any methods at lower embedding level.
    
    Method sets are not directly used by go/types (except for self-
    verification in debug mode); they are a functionality provided
    by go/types. Thus, the method sets that go/types is using were
    not affected by this bug.
    
    Fixes #37081.
