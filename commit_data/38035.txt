    net: fail fast for DNS rcode success with no answers of requested type
    
    DNS responses which do not contain answers of the requested type return
    errNoSuchHost, the same error as rcode name error. Prior to
    golang.org/cl/37879, both cases resulted in no additional name servers
    being consulted for the question. That CL changed the behavior for both
    cases. Issue #25336 was filed about the rcode name error case and
    golang.org/cl/113815 fixed it. This CL fixes the no answers of requested
    type case as well.
    
    Fixes #27525
