    cmd/go: fix objdir for run actions for -cover no-test packages
    
    As of CL 495447 we now synthesize coverage data (including coverage
    profiles) for packages that have no tests, if they are included in a
    "go test -cover" run. The code that set up the "run" actions for such
    tests wasn't setting the objdir for the action, which meant that the
    coverage profile temp file fragment ("_cover_.out") was being created
    in the dir where the test was run, and in addition the same fragment
    could be written to by more than one package (which could lead to a
    corrupted file). This CL updates the code to properly set the objdir,
    and to create the dir when needed.
    
    Updates #24570.
    Fixes #63356.
