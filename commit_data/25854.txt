    cmd/compile: remove parser lineno hack for issue #13267
    
    After golang.org/cl/19652 removed the bizarre lexlineno{++,--}
    statements for parsing canned imports, this hack for #13267 is no
    longer necessary:
    
        $ echo -n 0 > /tmp/0.go
        $ go tool compile /tmp/0.go
        /tmp/0.go:1: syntax error: package statement must be first
    
    Apparently setting lexlineno to 2 while parsing the canned imports
    caused prevlineno and lineno to also be set to 2.  After we finished
    parsing imports and restored lexlineno to 1, since "package" is the
    first token in a source file, we'll have fixed lineno = 1, but
    prevlineno was still set to 2.
