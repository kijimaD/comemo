    net: remove arbitrary deadlines in PacketConn tests
    
    When TestPacketConn was added (in CL 6501057) it included arbitrary
    100ms deadlines. Those deadlines were arbitrarily increased to 500ms
    in CL 4922.
    
    If the test is actually provoking a deadlock, allowing it to deadlock
    will give us a more useful goroutine dump. Otherwise, the deadlines
    don't seem all that useful â€” they appear to increase code coverage,
    but have no effect on the test in the typical case, and can only
    cause flakes on particularly-slow machines.
    
    For #43627
