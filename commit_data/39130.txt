    crypto/x509: ignore 5 phantom 1024-bit roots in TestSystemRoots
    
    On macOS 10.11, but not 10.10 and 10.12, the C API returns 5 old root
    CAs which are not in SystemRootCertificates.keychain (but seem to be in
    X509Anchors and maybe SystemCACertificates.keychain, along with many
    others that the C API does not return). They all are moribund 1024-bit
    roots which are now gone from the Apple store.
    
    Since we can't seem to find a way to make the no-cgo code see them,
    ignore them rather than skipping the test.
    
    Fixes #21416
