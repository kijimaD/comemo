    cmd/doc: rearrange the newlines to group better
    
    Main change is that the comment for an item no longer has a blank line
    before it, so it looks bound to the item it's about.
    
    Motivating example: go doc.io.read changes from
    
    <
    func (l *LimitedReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    func (r *PipeReader) Read(data []byte) (n int, err error)
    
        Read implements the standard Read interface: it reads data from the pipe,
        blocking until a writer arrives or the write end is closed. If the write end
        is closed with an error, that error is returned as err; otherwise err is
        EOF.
    func (s *SectionReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    >
    
    to
    
    <
    func (l *LimitedReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    func (r *PipeReader) Read(data []byte) (n int, err error)

    Now the comment about PipeReader.Read doesn't look like it's about
    SectionReader.
    
    Based on a suggestion by dsnet@, a slight tweak from a CL he suggested
    and abandoned.
    
    Fixes #12756,
