    misc/ios: fix exec wrapper locking
    
    The exec wrapper lock file was opened, locked and then never used
    again, assuming it would close and unlock at process exit.
    However, the garbage collector could collect and run the *os.File
    finalizer that closes the file prematurely, rendering the lock
    ineffective.
    
    Make the lock global so that the lock is live during the entire
    execution.
    
    (Hopefully) fix the iOS builders.
