    runtime: replace manually managed G dequeues with a type
    
    There are two manually managed G dequeues. Abstract these both into a
    shared gQueue type. This also introduces a gList type, which we'll use
    to replace several manually-managed G lists in follow-up CLs.
    
    This makes the code more readable and maintainable. gcFlushBgCredit in
    particular becomes much easier to follow. It also makes it easier to
    introduce more G queues in the future. Finally, the gList type clearly
    distinguishes between lists of Gs and individual Gs; currently both
    are represented by a *g, which can easily lead to confusion and bugs.
