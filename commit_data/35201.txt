    cmd/compile: workaround for inconsistent receiver param srcpos
    
    Given an inlinable method M in package P:
    
       func (r *MyStruct) M(...) {
    
    When M is compiled within its home package, the source position that
    the compiler records for 'r' (receiver parameter variable) is
    accurate, whereas if M is built as part of the compilation of some
    other package (body read from export data), the declaration line
    assigned to 'r' will be the line number of the 'import' directive, not
    the source line from M's source file.
    
    This inconsistency can cause differences in the size of abstract
    parameter DIEs (due to variable-length encoding), which can then in
    turn result in bad abstract origin offsets, which in turn triggers
    build failures on iOS (dsymutil crashes when it encounters an
    incorrect abstract origin reference).
    
    Work around the problem by removing the "declaration line number"
    attribute within the abstract parameter abbreviation table entry. The
    decl line attribute doesn't contribute a whole lot to the debugging
    experience, and it gets rid of the inconsistencies that trigger the
    dsymutil crashes.
    
    Updates #23374.
