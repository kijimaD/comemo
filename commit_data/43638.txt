    spec: split shift examples into groups for 32- and 64-bit ints
    
    In the current (pre-CL) version of the spec, the 2nd last shift
    example appears to be using the array declared in the last example.
    On a 32-bit platform, that array would have length 0, which would
    lead to a panic in the 2nd last example. Also, if this code were
    inside a function, it wouldn't compile (array declared after use).
    
    Use an explicitly declared array for that specific shift example.
    Also, split out all cases that produce different results for 32-
    vs 64-bit ints.
    
    Fixes #41835.
