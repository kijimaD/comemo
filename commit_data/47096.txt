    database: remove race in TestTxContextWait
    
    This test contained a data race.
    On line 437, db.BeginTx starts a goroutine that runs tx.awaitDone,
    which reads tx.keepConnOnRollback.
    On line 445, the test writes to tx.keepConnOnRollback.
    tx.awaitDone waits on ctx, but because ctx is timeout-based,
    there's no ordering guarantee between the write and the read.
    
    The race detector never caught this before
    because the context package implementation of Done
    contained enough synchronization to make it safe.
    That synchronization is not package of the context API or guarantees,
    and the first several releases it was not present.
    Another commit soon will remove that synchronization,
    exposing the latent data race.
    
    To fix the race, emulate a time-based context
    using an explicit cancellation-based context.
    This gives us enough control to avoid the race.
