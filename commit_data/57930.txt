    cmd/compile/internal/base: keep Ctxt.Flag_optimize in sync with Flag.N
    
    This patch fixes an inconsistency in compiler flag handling introduced
    accidentally in CL 521699. In the compiler we have both base.Flag.N
    (which records whether the user has supplied the "-N" flag to disable
    optimization) and base.Ctxt.Flag_optimize (which tracks whether
    optimization is turned on). In this case Flag.N was updated without a
    corresponding change to Ctxt.Flag_optimize, which led to problems with
    DWARF generation for the runtime.
    
    This CL doesn't include a regression test; a test will be added later
    in the x/debug repo in a subsequent CL.
    
    Updates #62523.
