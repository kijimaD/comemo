    cmd/compile: check width of embedded interfaces in expandiface
    
    The code in #20162 contains an embedded interface.
    
    It didn't get dowidth'd by the frontend,
    and during DWARF generation, ngotype asked
    for a string description of it,
    which triggered a request for the number of fields
    in the interface, which triggered a dowidth,
    which is disallowed in the backend.
    
    The other changes in this CL are to support the test.
    
    Fixes #20162
