    net: eliminate arbitrary timeout in TestVariousDeadlines
    
    When we set a timeout, we don't actually have a guarantee one how long
    the OS will take to notice it. Moreover, if the test deadlocks
    completely (for example, due to a deadline never taking effect), it
    would be more useful to get a full goroutine dump instead of the current
    "client stuck in Dial+Copy" failure message.
    
    For #37883
    For #41863
