    cmd/compile/internal/arm64: remove Reginuse check in clearfat
    
    Fixes golang/go#12133
    
    CL 13630 fixed the use of a stale reg[] array in the various arch
    backends which was causing the check in clearfat to pass
    unconditionally on arm64.
    
    With this check fixed, arm64 now considers REGRT1 to always be in use
    as it is part of the reserved register set, see arm64/gsubr.go.
    
    However, ppc64 does not consider REGRT1 and REGRT2 to be part of its
    reserved set, so its identical clearfat check passes.
    
    This CL removes the Reginuse check inside clearfat as REGRT1 is
    guarenteed always be free on arm64.
