    net/http: improve failure mode for TestResponseControllerSetPastReadDeadline
    
    A test flake in #59447 seems to indicate that this test got stuck
    waiting for the test handler to close the readc channel.
    If the handler returns early due to an unexpected error, it might
    fail to close this channel. Add a second channel to act as a
    signal that the handler has given up and the test should stop.
    This won't fix whatever happened in the flake, but might help
    us debug it if it happens again.
    
    For #59447
