    cmd/internal/obj/mips: don't emit spurious CALLIND relocations
    
    Generate a CALLIND relocation only for indirect calls, not for
    indirect jumps. In particular, the RET instruction is lowered to
    JMP (LR), an indirect jump, and occurs frequently. The large
    amount of spurious relocations causes the linker to do a lot of
    extra work.
