    test: move empty header file in builddir, buildrundir to temp directory
    
    Move the empty header file created by "builddir", "buildrundir"
    directives to t.tempDir. The file was accidentally placed in the
    same directory as the source code and this was a vestige of CL 146999.
    
    Fixes #28781
