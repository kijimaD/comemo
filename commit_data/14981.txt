    go/types: expose types.IsIdentical, the Type equivalence relation.
    
    This function is absolutely critical for clients such as
    exp/ssa, and too complex for clients to duplicate.
    
    As with CL 7200046, gri expressed in the doc below [gophers
    only] before going on leave that he intended to expose such a
    predicate, though his wording suggests as an interface method
    of Type rather than a standalone function.  (My preference is
    for binary methods to be standalone; see "On Binary Methods",
    Kim Bruce, 1995).  In any case if he wishes to move it that's
    easily accommodated by clients.
