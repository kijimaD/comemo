    math/rand: remove noop iteration in Perm
    
    The first iteration always do `m[0], m[0] = m[0], m[0]`, because
    `rand.Intn(1)` is 0.
    
    fun note: IIRC in TAOCP version of this algorithm, `i` goes
    backward (n-1->1), meaning that the "already" shuffled part of the
    array is never altered betweens iterations, while in the current
    implementation the "not-yet" shuffled part of the array is
    conserved between iterations.
