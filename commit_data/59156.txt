    cmd/compile: make jump table symbol static
    
    The jump table symbol is accessed only from the function symbol
    (in the same package), so it can be static. Also, if the function
    is DUPOK and it is, somehow, compiled differently in two different
    packages, the linker must choose the jump table symbol associated
    to the function symbol it chose. Currently the jump table symbol
    is DUPOK, so that is not guaranteed. Making it static will
    guarantee that, as each copy of the function symbol refers to its
    own jump table symbol.
    
    For #65783.
