    http: unified body transfer (read & write) logic in http.Request/Response.
    
    Compliance issue addressed here: POST requests carrying form data are required
    to use "identity" transfer encoding by common nginx and apache server configurations,
    e.g. wordpress.com (and many others). So, Request needed to be able to send
    non-chunked encodings.
    
    Thus, Request is extended to support identity and chunked encodings, like
    Response.  Since the Read() and Write() logic are shared by both (and are
    quite long), it is exported in a separate file transfer.go.
