    net: calling File disables the SetDeadline methods
    
    This essentially applies https://golang.org/cl/81636 to the net package.
    
    The full truth seems too complicated to write in this method's doc, so
    I'm going with a simple half truth.
    
    The full truth is that File returns the descriptor in blocking mode,
    because that is historically how it worked, and existing programs
    would be surprised if the descriptor is suddenly non-blocking. On Unix
    systems whether a socket is non-blocking or not is a property of the
    underlying file description, not of a particular file descriptor, so
    changing the returned descriptor to blocking mode also changes the
    existing socket to blocking mode. Blocking mode works fine, althoug I/O
    operations now take up a thread. SetDeadline and friends rely on the
    runtime poller, and the runtime poller only works if the descriptor is
    non-blocking. So it's correct that calling File disables SetDeadline.
    The other half of the truth is that if the program is willing to work
    with a non-blocking descriptor, it could call
    syscall.SetNonblock(f.Fd(), true) to change the descriptor, and
    the original socket, to non-blocking mode. At that point SetDeadline
    would start working again. I tried to write that in a way that is
    short and comprehensible but failed. Since we now have the RawConn
    approach to frobbing the descriptor, and hopefully most people can use
    that rather than calling File, I decided to punt.
