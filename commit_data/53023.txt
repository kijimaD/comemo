    cmd/cgo/internal/testcarchive: build on all platforms
    
    This test package uses syscall.SIGSEGV and syscall.SIGPIPE, which are
    defined on most, but not all platforms. Normally this test runs as
    part of dist test, which only registers this test on platforms that
    support c-archive build mode, which includes all platforms that define
    these signals. But this doesn't help if you're just trying to type
    check everything in cmd.
    
    Add build constraints so that this package type checks on all
    platforms.
    
    Fixes #60164.
    Updates #37486.
