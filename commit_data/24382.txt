    runtime: remove # from gctrace line
    
    Whenever someone pastes gctrace output into GitHub, it helpfully turns
    the GC cycle number into a link to some unrelated issue. Prevent this
    by removing the pound before the cycle number. The fact that this is a
    cycle number is probably more obvious at a glance than most of the
    other numbers.
