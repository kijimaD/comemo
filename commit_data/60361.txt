    cmd/link: don't let dsymutil delete our temp directory
    
    To work around #59026, where dsymutil may not clean up its temp
    directory at exit, we set DSYMUTIL_REPRODUCER_PATH to our temp
    directory so it uses that, and we can delete it at the end.
    
    In Xcode 16 beta, dsymutil deletes the DSYMUTIL_REPRODUCER_PATH
    directory even if it is not empty. We still need our tmpdir at the
    point, so give a subdirectory to dsymutil instead.
    
    For #68088.
