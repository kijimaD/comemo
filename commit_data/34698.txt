    cmd/go: treat cached test results as satisfying any timeout
    
    We want test caching to work even for people with scripts
    that set a non-default test timeout. But then that raises the
    question of what to do about runs with different timeouts:
    is a cached success with one timeout available for use when
    asked to run the test with a different timeout?
    
    This CL answers that question by saying that the timeout applies
    to the overall execution of either running the test or displaying
    the cached result, and displaying a cached result takes no time.
    So it's always OK to record a cached result, regardless of timeout,
    and it's always OK to display a cached result, again regardless of timeout.
    
    Fixes #22633.
