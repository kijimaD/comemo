    cmd/nm, cmd/objdump: fix elf symbol types
    
    Turns out elf.File.Sections is indexed by the actual
    section number, not the number minus one.
    I don't know why I thought the -1 was necessary.
    
    Fixes objdump test (and therefore build) on ELF systems.
    
    While we're here, fix bounds on gnuDump so that we
    don't crash when asked to disassemble outside
    the text segment. May fix Windows build or at least
    make the failure more interesting.
