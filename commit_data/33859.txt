    runtime: move evacuateX evacuateY relation check from makemap to evacuate
    
    Move the check near the code in evacuate that relies on
    the relation evacuateX+1 == evacuateY.
    
    If the relation is fullfilled the check is known to be true
    at compile time and removed by the compiler.
