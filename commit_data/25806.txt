    runtime: do not call timeBeginPeriod on windows
    
    Calling timeBeginPeriod changes Windows global timer resolution
    from 15ms to 1ms. This used to improve Go runtime scheduler
    performance, but not anymore. Thanks to @aclements, scheduler now
    behaves the same way if we call timeBeginPeriod or not.
    
    Remove call to timeBeginPeriod, since it is machine global
    resource, and there are downsides of using low timer resolution.
    See issue #8687 for details.
    
    Fixes #8687
