    sync: delete a sentence from the Map docs
    
    From Josh's comments on https://golang.org/cl/50310
    
    Once I removed the "from the Go standard library" bit, the beginning
    wasn't worth keeping. It also wasn't clear whether what it meant by
    "cache contention". Processor caches, or user-level caches built with
    sync.Map? It didn't seem worth clarifying and didn't convey any useful
    information, so deleted.
