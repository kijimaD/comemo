    cmd/gc: don't generate algs for internal map types.
    
    Fake types describing the internal structure of hashmaps are
    generated for use by precise GC.
    
    Generating hash and eq functions for these fake types slows down
    the build and wastes space: the go tool binary size is 13MB
    instead of 12MB, and the package size on amd64 is 48.7MB instead
    of 45.3MB.
