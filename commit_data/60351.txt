    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: Enable arm64 assembler tests for cross-compiler builds
    
    Some of the tests for the arm64 assembler are not running for
    cross-compiled arm64 builds with GOARCH=arm64. This patch allows the
    tests to run for all architectures and moves the test that can only run on
    arm64 into its own conditionally compiled file.
    
    Updates #44734
