    cmd/9l: fix bogus C conversion
    
    Looks like c2go and gcc disagree about the exact meaning of the
    usual arithmetic conversions, in a way that broke 9l's archreloc.
    Fix it.
    
    It's very hard for me to see why the original C code did not say
    what c2go interpreted it to say, but apparently it did not.
    This is why Go has explicit numerical conversions.
