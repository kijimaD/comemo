    cmd/doc: fix "builtin" package parsing
    
    As stated in the code, "The builtin package needs special treatment: its
    symbols are lower case but we want to see them, always". Thus, cmd/doc
    forces the -u flag if the package being queried is called "builtin".
    However, this happens after having already parsed the package. This
    CL forces the -u flag just after parsing the command arguments and
    before parsing any package.
    
    Fixes #49796.
