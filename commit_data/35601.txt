    path: use OS-specific function in MkdirAll, don't always keep trailing slash
    
    CL 86295 changed MkdirAll to always pass a trailing path separator to
    support extended-length paths on Windows.
    
    However, when Stat is called on an existing file followed by trailing
    slash, it will return a "not a directory" error, skipping the fast
    path at the beginning of MkdirAll.
    
    This change fixes MkdirAll to only pass the trailing path separator
    where required on Windows, by using an OS-specific function fixRootDirectory.
    
    Updates #23918
