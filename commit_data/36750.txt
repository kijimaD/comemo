+<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
+<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
 </ul>
 
-<p>
-If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to the
-Working Group using the process described below.
-<b>Do not</b> post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a
-particular individual or group.
-</p>
+<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
 
 <ul>
-<li>Mail <a href="mailto:conduct@golang.org">conduct@golang.org</a>.
-    <ul>
-    <li>Your message will reach the Working Group.
-    <li>Reports are confidential within the Working Group.
-    <li>You may contact a member of the group directly if you do not feel
-        comfortable contacting the group as a whole. That member will then raise
-        the issue with the Working Group as a whole, preserving the privacy of the
-        reporter (if desired).
-    <li>If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will be recused
-        from Working Group discussions of the report.
-    <li>The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion and
-        sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties,
-        and to avoid conflicts of interest.
-    </ul>
-<li>You should receive a response within 48 hours (likely sooner).
-    (Should you choose to contact a single Working Group member,
-    it may take longer to receive a response.)
-<li>The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine what happened.
-    <ul>
-    <li>With the permission of person reporting the incident, the Working Group
-        may reach out to other community members for more context.
-    </ul>
-<li>The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:
-    <ul>
-    <li>Nothing.
-    <li>Passing the report along to the offender.
-    <li>A recommendation of action to the relevant forum moderators.
-    </ul>
-<li>The Working Group will reach out to the original reporter to let them know
-    the decision.
-<li>Appeals to the decision may be made to the Working Group,
-    or to any of its members directly.
+<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
+advances</li>
+<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
+<li>Public or private harassment</li>
+<li>Publishing others&rsquo; private information, such as a physical or electronic
+address, without explicit permission</li>

+<h3 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h3>
+
+<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
+behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
+response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
+
+<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
+comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
+not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
+contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
+offensive, or harmful.</p>
+
+<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
+
+<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
+when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
+representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
+address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
+representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
+further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
+
+<p>This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project
+Steward has a reasonable belief that an individual&rsquo;s behavior may have a
+negative impact on the project or its community.</p>
+
+<h3 id="conflict-resolution"></a>Conflict Resolution</h3>
+
+<p>We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement
+often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or
+to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.</p>
+
+<p>If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address
+the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly
+and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their
+dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the
+behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing
+an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.</p>
+
+<p id="reporting">Reports should be directed to Cassandra Salisbury, the
+Go Project Steward, at <i>conduct@golang.org</i>.
+It is the Project Steward’s duty to
+receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then
+work with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source
+Programs Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you
+are uncomfortable reaching out the Project Steward, please email
+the Google Open Source Programs Office at <i>opensource@google.com</i>.</p>
+
+<p>We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.
+We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported
+incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from
+the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the
+report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken.
+The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report
+supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing
+harassment or threats to anyone&rsquo;s safety, we may take action without notice.</p>
