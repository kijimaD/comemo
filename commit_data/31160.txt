    runtime: darwin/amd64, don't depend on outarg slots being unmodified
    
    sigtramp was calling sigtrampgo and depending on the fact that
    the 3rd argument slot will not be modified on return.  Our calling
    convention doesn't guarantee that.  Avoid that assumption.
    
    There's no actual bug here, as sigtrampgo does not in fact modify its
    argument slots.  But I found this while working on the dead stack slot
    clobbering tool.  https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/23924/
