    doc/go1.20: document changes to the loopclosure vet analysis
    
    Address the release notes TODO regarding the loopclosure analyzer,
    documenting the new warning for parallel subtests.
    
    In doing so, choose a structure for the vet section, opting for h4
    headings. In recent years, we have used either h4 headings or simple
    paragraphs to document vet changes. This year, I thought it worthwhile
    to put the timeformat and loopclosure changes into separate sections.
    
    Also document the improvements to reference capture detection introduced
    in CL 452615.
