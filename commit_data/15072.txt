    cmd/dist: redirect acid output to file to separate from errors
    
    If runtime's proc.c does not compile, cmd/dist used to show
    the compile errors in a sea of acid output, making them impossible
    to find. Change the command invocation to write the acid output
    to a file, so that the errors are the only thing shown on failure.
