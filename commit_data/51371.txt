    runtime: eliminate arbitrary timeout in TestStackGrowth
    
    Instead, allow the test to run up until nearly the test's deadline,
    whatever that may be, and then crash with a panic (instead of calling
    t.Errorf) to get a useful goroutine dump.
    
    With the arbitrary timeout removed, we can now also run this test in
    short mode, reducing its impact on test latency.
    
    Fixes #19381
