    cmd/compile: change riscv64 Eq32/Neq32 to zero extend before subtraction
    
    As done with other equality tests, zero extend before subtraction rather than
    after (or in this case, at the same time). While at face value this appears to
    require more instructions, in reality it allows for most sign extensions to
    be completely eliminated due to correctly typed loads. Existing optimisations
    (such as subtraction of zero) then become more effective.
    
    This removes more than 10,000 instructions from the Go binary and in particular,
    a writeBarrier check only requires three instructions (AUIPC, LWU, BNEZ) instead
    of the current four (AUIPC, LWU, NEGW, BNEZ).
