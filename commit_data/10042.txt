    godoc: generate package toc in template, not in JavaScript
    
    1. Generate TOC for package pages using template,
    instead of using JavaScript magic.  This makes the
    pages generated by godoc -html easier to export
    to other systems.
    
    2. Make TOC one column.  It's hard to do two columns
    portably without invoking JavaScript.
    
    3. Since the TOC is only one column, show full type
    signatures for functions and methods.  Many times
    that's all you need to see anyway.
    
    4. Name the section after the TOC "Overview".
    Naming it something is important, to set it off
    from the TOC and so that there's a quick link to
    it in the TOC.
    
    For now, some illustrative examples:
    
    http://swtch.com:6060/pkg/io/
    http://swtch.com:6060/pkg/strings/
    http://swtch.com:6060/pkg/tabwriter/
    http://swtch.com:6060/pkg/unicode/
    
    Fixes #1982.
