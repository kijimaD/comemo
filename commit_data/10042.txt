    ld: modify macho linkedit segment to enable OS X code signing
    
    Move string table to the end of the __LINKEDIT segment.
    
    This change allows Apple's codesign(1) utility to successfully sign
    Go binaries, as long as they don't contain DWARF data (-w flag to
    8l/6l).  This is because codesign(1) expects the string table to be
    the last part of the file.
