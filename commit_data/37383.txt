    misc/cgo/test: disable some Darwin tests in cgo mode
    
    For unknown reasons, linking against CoreFoundation on macOS 10.10
    sometimes causes mmap to ignore the hint address, which makes the Go
    allocator incompatible with TSAN. Currently, the effect of this is to
    run the allocator out of arena hints on the very first allocation,
    causing a "too many address space collisions for -race mode" panic.
    
    This CL skips the cgo tests that link against CoreFoundation in race
    mode.
    
    Updates #26475.
    Updates #26513.
