    cmd/cover: retain un-attached compiler directives
    
    Parser doesn't attach some compiler directives to anything in the tree.
    We have to explicitely retain them in the generated code. This change,
    makes cover explicitely print out any compiler directive that wasn't
    handled in the ast.Visitor.
    
    Fixes #18285.
