    net/url: fix missing handling for opaque value in ResolveReference method
    
    The current implementation doesn't resolve as per spec RFC 3986 the case
    where the base URL has an opaque value, and the reference doesn't have
    either a scheme, authority or path. Currently, this specific case falls
    back to the "abs_path" or "rel_path" cases, where the final path results
    of the base_path being resolved relatively to the reference's, but since
    the opaque value is stored independently, it needs a case of its own.
    
    The algorith for resolving references is defined in RFC 3986 section 5.2.2:
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html#section-5.2.2
    
    Fixes #66084
