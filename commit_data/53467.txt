    runtime: refactor ARM VDSO call setup to helper
    
    We have a very complex process to make VDSO calls on ARM. Create a
    wrapper helper function which reduces duplication and allows for
    additional calls from other packages.
    
    vdsoCall has a few differences from the original code in
    walltime/nanotime:
    
    * It does not use R0-R3, as they are passed through as arguments to fn.
    * It does not save g if g.m.gsignal.stack.lo is zero. This may occur if
    it called at startup on g0 between assigning g0.m.gsignal and setting
    its stack.
    
    For #49182
