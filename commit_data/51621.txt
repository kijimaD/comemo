    cmd/go: include coverage build flags for "go list"
    
    This patch ensures that the go command's "list" subcommand accepts
    coverage-related build options, which were incorrectly left out when
    "go build -cover" was rolled out. This is needed in order to do things
    like check the staleness of an installed cover-instrumented target.
    
    Fixes #57785.
