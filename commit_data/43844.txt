    cmd/compile: remove If type in rulegen
    
    We only generate if statements via CondBreak, which is nice as the
    control flow is simple and easy to work with. It seems like the If type
    was added but never used, so remove it to avoid confusion.
    
    We had a TODO about replacing CondBreak with If instead. I gave that a
    try, but it doesn't seem worth the effort. The code gets more complex
    and we don't really win anything in return.
    
    While at it, don't use op strings as format strings in exprf. This
    doesn't cause any issue at the moment, but it's best to be explicit
    about the operator not containing any formatting verbs.
