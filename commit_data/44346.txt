    cmd/compile: use transitive relations for slice len/cap in poset
    
    Currently, we keep track of slice len by mapping from slice ID to
    len/cap SSA value. However, slice len/cap can have multiple SSA values,
    so when updating fact table for slice len/cap, we only update in one
    place.
    
    Instead, we can take advantage of the transitive relations provided by
    poset. So all duplicated slice lens are set as equal to one another.
    When updating fact table for one, that fact will be reflected to all
    others. The same mechanism is applied for slice cap.
    
    Removes 15 bounds checks from std/cmd.
    
    Fixes #42603
