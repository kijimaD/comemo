    cmd/dist,internal/platform: temporarily disable race detector on openbsd/amd64
    
    Unfortunately, LLVM TSAN decided to remove OpenBSD support, which
    means that the syso files cannot currently be regenerated (see #52090).
    The race_openbsd.syso contains a reference to the syscall symbol,
    which has been removed from OpenBSD's libc in 7.5. As such, this
    means that the race detector no longer works on openbsd/amd64 (at
    least until LLVM TSAN support is reinstated for OpenBSD).
    
    Updates #63900
