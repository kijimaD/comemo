    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of issues_test.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/issues_test.go
    and issues_test.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 3. The actual
    change is just removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker and making making
    some minor code adjustments to match go/types's version more closely.
