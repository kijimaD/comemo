    runtime: handle async fatal signals in VDSO
    
    If we receive an async signal while running in the VDSO, such as a
    SIGABRT or SIGSEGV sent from another process, we fail to print the
    stacktrace with "runtime: unknown pc <vdso PC>".
    
    We already have machinery to handle SIGPROF in the VDSO, but it isn't
    hooked up for other signals. Add it to the general signal traceback
    path.
    
    This case is covered by TestSegv by making the test more strict w.r.t.
    accepted output.
    
    Fixes #47537
