    runtime: improve ExampleFrames
    
    CL 40876 changed ExampleFrames so that the output
    was stable with and without mid-stack inlining.
    
    However, that change lost some of the
    pedagogical and copy/paste value of the example.
    It was unclear why both more and i were being tracked,
    and whether the 5 in i < 5 is related to len(pc),
    and if so, why and how.
    
    This CL rewrites the example with lots more comments,
    and such that the core structure more closely matches
    normal usage, and such that it is obvious
    which lines of code should be deleted when copying.
    As a bonus, it also now illustrates Frame.File.
