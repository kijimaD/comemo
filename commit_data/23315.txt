    os: rewrite LookupEnv's test
    
    GOROOT is not dependably set.
    
    When I first wrote this test, I thought it was a waste of time
    because the function can't fail if the other environment functions
    work, but I didn't want to add functionality without testing it.
    Of course, the test broke, and I learned something: GOROOT is not
    set on iOS or, to put it more broadly, the world continues to
    surprise me with its complexity and horror, such as a version of
    cat with syntax coloring.
    
    In that vein, I built this test around smallpox.
