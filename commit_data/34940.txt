    go/types: report error when recognizing issue #18395.
    
    The fix (CL 79575) for #18395 is too risky at this stage of the Go 1.10
    release process.
    
    Since issue #18395 is easily recognized (but not easily fixed), report
    an error instead of silently continuing. This avoids inscrutable follow
    on errors.
    
    Also, make sure all empty interfaces are "completed", and adjust
    printing code to report incomplete interfaces.
    
    For #18395.
