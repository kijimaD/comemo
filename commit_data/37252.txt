    strings: lower running time of TestCompareStrings
    
    At each comparison, we're making a copy of the whole string.
    Instead, use unsafe to share the string backing store with a []byte.
    
    It reduces the test time from ~4sec to ~1sec on my machine
    (darwin/amd64).  Some builders were having much more trouble with this
    test (>3min), it may help more there.
    
    Fixes #26174
    Fixes #28573
