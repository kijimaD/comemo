commit 531e3fe311c01f8c5adb37517c3293f064880773
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    - fix regexp once more in doc.go:
      comment markers must only be stripped if they are
      at the very beginning otherwise comments that contain
      code with comments get screwed up (the ast delivers clean
      comments with no junk before or after)
    
    - fix indentation in google/net/rpc/rpc.go which screwed up
      godoc formatting
