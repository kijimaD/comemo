    cmd/dist: add "devel" substring check to isRelease computation
    
    Non-release versions that are built from source without a VERSION file
    specifying any particular version end up with a development version like
    "devel go1.25-67e0681aef Thu Apr 24 12:17:27 2025 -0700". Right now
    those versions are correctly determined to be non-release because they
    don't have a "go" prefix, instead they have a "devel " prefix.
    
    In preparation of being able to move the "devel" substring, add a check
    that said substring isn't present anywhere, since it is certain not to
    be included in any released Go version we publish at https://go.dev/dl/.
    
    For #73372.
