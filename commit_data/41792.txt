    cmd/compile: avoid zero extensions after 32-bit shifts
    
    zeroUpper32Bits wasn't checking for shift-extension ops. This would not
    check shifts that were marking as bounded by prove (normally, shifts
    are wrapped in a sequence that ends with an ANDL, and zeroUpper32Bits
    would see the ANDL).
    
    This produces no changes on generated output right now, but will be
    important once CL196679 lands because many shifts will be marked
    as bounded, and lower will stop generating the masking code sequence
    around them.
