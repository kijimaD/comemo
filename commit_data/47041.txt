    cmd/compile: clean up the switch statements in (*genInst).node()
    
    There were two main outer switch statements in node() that can just be
    combined. Also, for simplicity, changed an IsCmp() conditional into just
    another case in the switch statement.
    
    Also, the inner OCALL switch statement had a bunch of fairly duplicate
    cases. Combined the cases that all had no special semantics, into a
    single default case calling transformCall().
    
    In the OCALL case in dictPass(), got rid of a check for OFUNCINST (which
    will always have been removed by this point). Also, eliminated an assert
    that could cause unneded failures. transformCall() should always be
    called if the node op is still OCALL, so no need to assert on the ops of
    call.X.
    
    Added an extra test in issue47078.go, to explicitly check for case where
    the X argument of a call is a DOTTYPE.
