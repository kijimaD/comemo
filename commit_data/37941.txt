    cmd/compile: skip float32 constant folding test on 387 builder
    
    The 387 unit always quietens float64 and float32 signaling NaNs,
    even when just loading and storing them. This makes it difficult
    to propagate such values in the compiler. This is a hard problem
    to fix and it is also very obscure.
    
    Updates #27516.
