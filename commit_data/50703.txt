    net/http: adjust a substring which matches "uninteresting" goroutine
    
    This change allows the check to pass unmodified under GopherJS, which
    stack traces are formatted differently (due to being generated by
    NodeJS). There are no other functions named `interestingGoroutines` in
    the standard library, so it's very unlikely to create false negatives,
    and will allow reduce the number of overlays GopherJS needs to maintain.
