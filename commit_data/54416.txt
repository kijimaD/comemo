    misc/cgo/testasan: drop test
    
    The testasan test was added back in 2013 (CL 10126044), many years
    before Go added ASAN support in 2021 (CL 298611). So, in fact,
    testasan does not test Go ASAN support at all, as you might expect
    (misc/cgo/testsanitizers does that). It's intended to test whether the
    Go memory allocator works in a mixed C/Go binary where the C code is
    compiled with ASAN. The test doesn't actually use ASAN in any way; it
    just simulates where ASAN of 2013 put its shadow mappings. This made
    sense to test at the time because Go was picky about where its heap
    landed and ASAN happened to put its mappings exactly where Go wanted
    to put its heap. These days, Go is totally flexible about its heap
    placement, and I wouldn't be surprised if ASAN also works differently.
    
    Given all of this, this test adds almost no value today. Drop it.
    
    For #37486, since it eliminates a non-go-test from dist.
