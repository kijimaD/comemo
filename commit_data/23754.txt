    cmd/go: build errors rather than strings in some tests
    
    Speed up the test suite by building the errors package rather than the
    strings package in some cases where the specific package we are
    building doesn't matter.  The errors package is smaller, and doesn't
    have any assembler code.
    
    Also make a couple of tests run in parallel.
    
    Update #11779.
