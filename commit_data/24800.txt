    runtime: never allocate new M when jumping time forward
    
    When we're jumping time forward, it means everyone is asleep, so there
    should always be an M available. Furthermore, this causes both
    allocation and write barriers in contexts that may be running without
    a P (such as in sysmon).
    
    Hence, replace this allocation with a throw.
    
    Updates #10600.
