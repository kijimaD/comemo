    cmd/pack: avoid ./ import in test (fix Windows build)
    
    It is possible to use ./ imports on Windows but it
    requires some extra command-line work
    ('go build' does this automatically, but we can't use 'go build' here).
    
    Instead, use an ordinary import and -I/-L, which are easier to use.
