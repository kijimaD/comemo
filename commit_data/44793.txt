    test: document specifying individual test files as operands
    
    The current command will run this entire set of tests, which takes a
    noticeable amount of time. Contributors may wish to run only a subset of
    these tests to save time/compute (e.g. when iterating on a CL that
    failed tests in that subset). Listing file(s) as operands to the command
    will run only those tests.
