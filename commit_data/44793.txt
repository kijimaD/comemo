    test: document specifying individual test files as operands
    
    The current command will run this entire set of tests, which takes a
    noticeable amount of time. Contributors may wish to run only a subset of
    these tests to save time/compute (e.g. when iterating on a CL that
    failed tests in that subset). Listing file(s) as operands to the command
    will run only those tests.

 Standard library tests should be written as regular Go tests in the appropriate package.
 
 The tool chain and runtime also have regular Go tests in their packages.
