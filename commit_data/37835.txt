    cmd/compile: modify swt.go to skip repeated walks of switch
    
    The compiler appears to contain several squirrelly corner
    cases where nodes are double walked, some where new nodes
    are created from walked parts.  Rather than trust that we
    had searched hard enough for the last one, change
    exprSwitch.walk() to return immediately if it has already
    been walked.  This appears to be the only case where
    double-walking a node is actually harmful.
    
    Fixes #29562.
