    - Preliminary draft of what might become a real spec
    - All text taken from go_lang.txt (which is unchanged),
    but added a contents section, and sorted the contents
    section in a hopefully sensible manner to give it more
    structure
    - Reordered text to match order of contents section,
    did not adjust the language (needs to be done),
    but removed sections that were dulicates or invalid
    
    High-level organization of the doc:
    - Introduction
    - Notation
    - Source code representation
    - Vocabulary
    - Declarations and scope rules
    - Types
    - Expressions
    - Statements
    - Function declarations
    - Packages
    - Program initialization and execution
    
    I hope this new structure will make it much clearer which
    pieces are missing and where they need to go. go_lang.txt
    has grown somewhat unstructured and new text was added as
    we saw fit.
