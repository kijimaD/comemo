    [dev.link] cmd/link: remove holes from global index space
    
    In CL 217064, we made symbol's global index unique, but we still
    reserve index space for each object file, which means we may
    leave holes in the index space if the symbol is a dup or is
    overwritten. In this CL, we stop reserving index spaces. Instead,
    symbols are added one at a time, and only added if it does not
    already exist. There is no more holes in the index space.
