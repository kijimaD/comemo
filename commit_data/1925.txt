commit b87e3e8b7f37a97c383ae5bbfadb401ec6fc243c
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    * move go-specific loader code
    into gc directory, where it gets included as ../gc/ldbody
    this is similar to the assemblers including ../cc/lexbody
    and ../cc/macbody.
    
    * hook go-specific loader code into 8l.
    
    * make current 8.out.h and 6.out.h backward compatible
    with plan 9's versions.  i had added some constants in
    the middle of enums and have now moved them to the end.
    this keeps us from invalidating old .8 and .6 files.
    not sure how much it really matters, but easy to do.
