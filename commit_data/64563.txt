    cmd/dist: require Go 1.22.6 as minimum bootstrap toolchain
    
    This is a minimal change to start to require the new minimum bootstrap.
    Taking advantage of the newer bootstap to simplify and improve code is
    left to be done in separate CLs.
    
    For #64751.

+As mentioned in the [Go 1.22 release notes](/doc/go1.22#bootstrap), Go 1.24 now requires
+Go 1.22.6 or later for bootstrap.
+We expect that Go 1.26 will require a point release of Go 1.24 or later for bootstrap.
