    encoding: report correct line numbers in tests
    
    Some of the _test.go files in the encoding packages contain a private
    function called testEqual that calls testing.Errorf if the arguments
    passed to it are unequal.   The line numbers output by such calls to
    Errorf identify the failure as being in testEqual itself which is not
    very useful.  This commit fixes the problem by adding a call to the
    new t.Helper method in each of the testEqual functions.  The line
    numbers output when errors do occur now identify the real source of
    the error.
