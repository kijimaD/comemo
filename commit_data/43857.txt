    runtime: add spanSet data structure
    
    This change copies the gcSweepBuf data structure into a new file and
    renames it spanSet. It will serve as the basis for a heavily modified
    version of the gcSweepBuf data structure for the new mcentral
    implementation.
    
    We move it into a separate file now for two reasons:
    1. We will need both implementations as they will coexist simultaneously
       for a time.
    2. By creating it now in a new change it'll make future changes which
       modify it easier to review (rather than introducing the new file then).
    
    Updates #37487.
