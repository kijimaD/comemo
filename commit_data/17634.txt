    crypto/tls: don't select ECDSA ciphersuites with only an RSA certificate.
    
    47ec7a68b1a2 added support for ECDSA ciphersuites but didn't alter the
    cipher suite selection to take that into account. Thus Go servers could
    try and select an ECDSA cipher suite while only having an RSA
    certificate, leading to connection failures.
