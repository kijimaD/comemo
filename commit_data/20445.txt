    runtime: reenable TestStackGrowth on 32-bit systems
    
    If this needs to be turned back off, it should be done
    just before the '// in finalizer' comment, not at the top
    of the function.
    
    GC is more precise now than it was (the only imprecise
    stuff left is some global variables), so maybe the finalizer
    test will work now on 32-bit systems.
