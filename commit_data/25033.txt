    runtime: skip CallbackGC test in short mode on linux/arm
    
    Fixes #11959
    Fixes #12035
    
    Skip the CallbackGC test on linux/arm. This test takes between 30 and 60
    seconds to run by itself, and is run 4 times over the course of ./run.bash
    (once during the runtime test, three times more later in the build).
