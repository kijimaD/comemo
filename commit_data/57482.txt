    cmd/compile: ensure write barrier branches get marked uninterruptible
    
    The branch itself can't be marked, so we ensure we mark the last
    ssa.Value in the block as uninterruptible, because that's where the
    branch ends up getting its uninterruptibility from.
    
    This is somewhat conservative, as we're marking an instruction as
    uninterruptible that doesn't need to be. But it is an easy fix.
    
    TODO: figure out a test
