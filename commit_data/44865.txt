    cmd/go/internal/modload: refactor pathInModuleCache
    
    I found the control flow of this function a bit tricky to reason about
    due to nesting and interaction between conditions and iteration. This
    change factors out a helper function that can return early instead of
    mixing conditionals and 'continue' statements.
    
    Also remove the (unused) ModuleUsedDirectly function.
    
    For #36460
