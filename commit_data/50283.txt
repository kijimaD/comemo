    cmd/go: move module build info formatting into runtime/debug
    
    Previously, modload.PackageBuildInfo returned a string containing
    information about modules used to build an executable. This string is
    embedded in the binary and can be read with debug.ReadBuildInfo or
    'go version -m'.
    
    With this change, debug.BuildInfo now has a MarshalText method that
    returns a string in the same format as modload.PackageBuildInfo.
    
    Package.load now calls Package.setBuildInfo, which constructs a
    debug.BuildInfo, formats it with MarshalText, then sets
    Package.Internal.BuildInfo. This is equivalent to what
    modload.PackageBuildInfo did.
    
    modload.PackageBuildInfo is deleted, since it's no longer used.
    
    For #37475
