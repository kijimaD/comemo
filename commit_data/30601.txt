commit 67d69f899ce0fcd3d7aee0a07554fb84770020c0

    cmd/compile: set base register of spill/restore to SP
    
    Previously the base register was unset, which lead to the disassembler
    using "FP" instead of "SP" as the base register.  That lead to some
    confusion as to what the difference betweeen the two was.
    Be consistent and always use SP.
    
    Fixes #19458
