    net: fix concurrent Accept on windows
    Runtime netpoll supports at most one read waiter
    and at most one write waiter. It's responsibility
    of net package to ensure that. Currently windows
    implementation allows more than one waiter in Accept.
    It leads to "fatal error: netpollblock: double wait".
