    cmd/compile: make the second argument to go:linkname optional
    
    The //go:linkname directive can be used to make a symbol accessible to
    another package (when it wouldn't normally be). Sometimes you want to
    do this without actually changing the symbol's object file symbol
    name; for example, in gccgo this makes unexported symbols non-static,
    and in gc this provides ABI0 wrappers for Go symbols so they can be
    called from assembly in other packages. Currently, this results in
    stutter like
    
       //go:linkname entersyscall runtime.entersyscall
    
    This CL makes the second argument to go:linkname optional for the case
    where the intent is simply to expose the symbol rather than to rename
    it in the object file.
    
    Updates #31230.
