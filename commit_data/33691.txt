commit 305fd9179d2199cd1bb64402405857d2f2d02478

    flag: document that custom usage functions are free to call os.Exit
    
    Some custom usage functions call it for clarity; others rely on the default
    behavior, which makes an explicit call redundant. Document that it's
    safe to be explicit.
    
    Fixes #21671.
