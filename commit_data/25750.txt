    runtime: show panics in traceback
    
    We used to include panic calls in tracebacks; however, when
    runtime.panic was renamed to runtime.gopanic in the conversion of the
    runtime to Go, we missed the special case in showframe that includes
    panic calls even though they're in package runtime.
    
    Fix the function name check in showframe (and, while we're here, fix
    the other check for "runtime.panic" in runtime/pprof). Since the
    "runtime.gopanic" name doesn't match what users call panic and hence
    isn't very user-friendly, make traceback rewrite it to just "panic".
    
    Updates #5832, #13857. Fixes #14315.
