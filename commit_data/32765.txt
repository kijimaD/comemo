    cmd/compile: test for moving spills
    
    Test that we really do move spills down to the dominator of
    all the uses.
    
    Also add a test where go1.8 would have moved the spill out of
    the loop into two exit points, but go1.9 doesn't move the spill.
    This is a case where the 1.9 spill moving code does not subsume
    the 1.8 spill moving code.
    
    Maybe we resurrect moving-spills-out-of-loops CL to fix this one.
    (I suspect it wouldn't be worth the effort, but would be happy
    to hear evidence otherwise.)
    
    Update #20472
