    cmd/dist: tolerate macOS writing .DS_Store to GOROOT/bin
    
    I was trying out gorebuild (a program that runs make.bash many times)
    on a macOS system. Unfortunately there were a few failed invocations
    on my first try, but not with a very good or interesting reason:
    
    go tool dist: unexpected new file in $GOROOT/bin: .DS_Store
    
    Tolerate it since it's not unexpected, and will not affect the build.
