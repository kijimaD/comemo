    cmd/compile: panic if trying to alias an intrinsic with no definitions
    
    Currently if we try to alias an intrinsic which hasn't been defined for
    any architecture (such as by accidentally creating the alias before the
    intrinsic is created with addF), then we'll just silently not apply any
    intrinsics to those aliases.
    
    Catch this particular case by panicking in alias if we try to apply the
    alias and it did nothing.
