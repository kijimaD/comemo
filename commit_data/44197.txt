    syscall: clean up mkasm related changes
    
    The mkasm_darwin.go file was renamed to mkasm.go in CL 270380, with OpenBSD
    support being added. The mkasm_openbsd.go file should not have been merged,
    so remove it. Fix up references to mkasm_$GOOS.go and provide $GOOS as an
    argument on invocation.
    
    Updates #36435
