    runtime: don't call msanread when running on the system stack
    
    The runtime is not instrumented, but the calls to msanread in the
    runtime can sometimes refer to the system stack.  An example is the call
    to copy in stkbucket in mprof.go.  Depending on what C code has done,
    the system stack may appear uninitialized to msan.
