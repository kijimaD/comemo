    net/http/httputil: tell people not to use ClientConn and ServerConn
    
    A very smart developer at Gophercon just asked me to help debug
    a problem and I was horrified to learn that he was using httputil's
    ClientConn. I forgot ClientConn and ServerConn were even included
    in Go 1! They should've been deleted.
    
    Scare people away from using them. The net/http package does
    not use them and they're unused, unmaintained and untouched in
    4+ years.
