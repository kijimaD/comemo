    slices, maps: add examples; doc comment fixes
    
    There are currently no examples in the new slices and maps package, so
    add some. This adds examples for most functions in the slices package
    except the very obvious ones, and adds examples for the DeleteFunc and
    EqualFunc functions in the maps package.
    
    Also clarify/correct a few doc comments:
    
    * EqualFunc takes an "equality" function, not a "comparison" function
    * It's confusing for Delete and DeleteFunc to say they "do not create a
      new slice", as they do return a new slice. They already say they
      "return the modified slice" which is enough.
    * Similar for Compact, and mention that it returns the modified slice
      (and say why)
    * Note that CompactFunc keeps the first element in equal runs
    * Say what cmp is in SortStableFunc and IsSortedFunc
    * Say that MinFunc and MaxFunc return the first value
