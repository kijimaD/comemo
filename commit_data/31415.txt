    cmd/go/internal/get: allow go get on github.com/ import paths with Unicode letters
    
    More specifically, allow Unicode letters in the directories of GitHub
    repositories, which can occur and don't have a valid reason to be
    disallowed by go get.
    
    Do so by using a predefined character class, the Unicode character
    property class \p{L} that describes the Unicode characters that are
    letters:
    
            http://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html#category
    
    Since it's not possible to create GitHub usernames or repositories
    containing Unicode letters at this time, those parts of the import path
    are still restricted to ASCII letters only.
    
    Fix name of tested func in t.Errorf messages.
    
    Fixes #18660.
