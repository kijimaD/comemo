            Fix minor issues with updating go-mode in an empty buffer
    
      Sometimes during editing, when the buffer is emptied (for example,
      as part of a call to M-x gofmt), an error is raised when
      remove-text-properties is called. Ensure that these calls use point-max
      instead of buffer-size to determine their end point.
