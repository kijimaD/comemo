    net/http/pprof: skip TestDeltaProfile on all arm and arm64 architectures
    
    Given that we have seen failures with the same failure mode on both
    openbsd/arm and android/arm64, it seems likely that the underlying bug
    affects at least all ARM-based architectures.
    
    It appears that either these architectures are not able to sample at
    the frequency expected by the test, or the samples are for some reason
    being dropped.
    
    For #50218
