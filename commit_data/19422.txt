    spec: specify order of init() calls
    
    The spec did not specify the order in which
    init() functions are called. Specify that
    they are called in source order since we have
    now also specified the initialization order
    of independent variables.
    
    While technically a language change, no
    existing code could have relied on this,
    so this should not break anything.
    
    Per suggestion from rsc.

 <p>
 A package with no imports is initialized by assigning initial values
 to all its package-level variables followed by calling all <code>init</code>
-functions in unspecified order.
+functions in the order they appear in the source, possibly in multiple files,
+as presented to the compiler.
 If a package has imports, the imported packages are initialized
 before initializing the package itself. If multiple packages import
 a package, the imported package will be initialized only once.
