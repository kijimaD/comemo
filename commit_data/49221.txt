    runtime/pprof: slow new goroutine launches in test
    
    The goroutine profiler tests include one that launches a steady stream
    of goroutines. That creates a scheduler busy loop that can prevent
    forward progress in the rest of the program. Slow down the launches a
    bit so other goroutines have a chance to run.
    
    Fixes #52916
    For #52934
