 The capacity, in number of elements, sets the size of the buffer in the channel. If the
-capacity is greater than zero, the channel is asynchronous: provided the
-buffer is not full, sends can succeed without blocking. If the capacity is zero
-or absent, the communication succeeds only when both a sender and receiver are ready.
+capacity is greater than zero, the channel is asynchronous: communication operations
