    runtime: simplify trace buffer management around footer
    
    Writing out the trace footer currently manages trace buffers
    differently from the rest of trace code. Rearrange it so it looks like
    the rest of the code. In particular, we now write the frequency event
    out to the trace buffer rather than returning it in a special byte
    slice, and (*traceStackTable).dump threads a traceBufPtr like most
    other functions that write to the trace buffers.
