    go/scanner: minimal non-terminated literals
    
    Consume as little as possible input when encountering
    non-terminated rune, string, and raw string literals.
    The old code consumed at least one extra character
    which could lead to worse error recovery when parsing
    erroneous sources.
    
    Also made error messages in those cases more consistent.
    
    Fixes #7091.
