    hash: document that the encoded state may contain input in plaintext
    
    The cryptographic checksums operate in blocks of 64 or 128 bytes,
    which means that the last 128 bytes or so of the input may be encoded
    in its original (plaintext) form as part of the state.
    Document this so users do not falsely assume that the encoded state
    carries no reversible information about the input.
