    cmd/link: memoize/cache whether plugin.Open symbol available
    
    Perform a single lookup of "plugin.Open" at the point where we set the
    loaded flag for the context, then cache whether the result is nil, so
    that we can consult this cached value later on (instead of having to
    look up the symbol each time). This helps speed up the DynLinkingGo()
    context method, which is called from within some very hot loops in the
    linker (when linking 'hyperkube' from kubernetes, reduces total calls
    to "sym.(*Symbols).ROLookup" from 6.5M to 4.3M)
