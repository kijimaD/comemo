    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile/ssa: fix build
    
    Somehow I missed this in CL 11160.
    Without it, all.bash fails on fixedbugs/bug303.go.
    
    The right fix is probably to discard the variable
    and keep going, even though the code is dead.
    
    For now, defer the decision by declaring
    such situations unimplemented and get the build
    fixed.
