    cmd/go/internal/work: remove a redundant call to modload.LoadedModules
    
    The modload.EditBuildList call added in CL 270980 already ensures that
    installMod does not require a newer version of itself, so the condition
    that this loop is checking for is redundant.
    
    (I had meant for this change to be included in CL 270980, but
    apparently somehow reverted it prior to mailing.)
    
    For #36460
