    cmd/internal: add MVCIN instruction to s390x assembler
    
    On s390x, we already have MVCIN opcode in asmz.go,
    but we did not use it. This CL uses that opcode and adds MVCIN
    instruction.
    
    MVCIN instruction can be used to move data from one storage location
    to another while reversing the order of bytes within the field. This
    could be useful when transforming data from little-endian to big-endian.
