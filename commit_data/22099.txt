    cmd/dist: update android testing TODO, add iOS
    
    This CL updates a TODO on a condition excluding a lot of tests on
    android, clarifying what needs to be done. Several of the tests should
    be turned off, for example anything depending on the Go tool, others
    should be enabled. (See #8345, comment 3 for more details.)
    
    Also add iOS, which has the same set of restrictions.
    
    Tested manually on linux/amd64, darwin/amd64, android/arm, darwin/arm.
    
    Updates #8345
