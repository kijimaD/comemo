    misc/dist: use archive/zip, seek out windows deps, add --upload flag
    
    Use archive/zip instead of 7z on Windows.
    
    Look for all Windows deps before starting build, and include looking
    for them in their common locations instead of making users update
    their PATHs.
    
    Add an --upload flag that, if set to false, doesn't require credential
    files.
