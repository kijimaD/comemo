    go/parser: don't parse a nil IndexExpr.Index
    
    When parsing type parameters, an empty type instantiation was parsed as
    an IndexExpr with nil Index. This should be considered a breaking change
    to parsing: ast.Walk previously assumed that Index was non-nil.
    
    Back out the nil check in ast.Walk, and for now pack an empty argument
    list as a non-nil ListExpr with nil Elems.
    
    Alternatives considered:
     - Parsing the entire index expression as a BadExpr: this led to
       inferior errors while type checking.
     - Parsing the Index as a BadExpr: this seems reasonable, but encodes
       strictly less information into the AST.
    
    We may want to opt for one of these alternatives in the future, but for
    now let's just fix the breaking change.
