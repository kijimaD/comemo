    cmd/compile: change dead code into assert
    
    After fixing #13587, I noticed that the "OAS2FUNC in disguise" block
    looked like it probably needed write barriers too.  However, testing
    revealed the multi-value "return f()" case was already being handled
    correctly.
    
    It turns out this block is dead code due to "return f()" already being
    transformed into "t1, t2, ..., tN := f(); return t1, t2, ..., tN" by
    orderstmt when f is a multi-valued function.
    
    Updates #13587.
