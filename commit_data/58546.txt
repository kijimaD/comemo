    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: cleanup and remove usage of getimpliedreg
    
    getimpliedreg was used to set a default register in cases where
    one was implied but not set by the assembler or compiler.
    
    In most cases with constant values, R0 is implied, and is the value
    0 by architectural design.  In those cases, R0 is always used, so
    treat 0 and REG_R0 as interchangeable in those encodings.
    
    Similarly, the pseudo-register SP or FP is used to in place of the
    stack pointer, always R1 on PPC64. Unconditionally set this during
    classification of NAME_AUTO and NAME_PARAM as it may be 0.
    
    The case where REGSB might be returned from getimpliedreg is never
    used. REGSB is aliased to R2, but in practice it is either R0 or R2
    depending on buildmode. See symbolAccess in asm9.go for an example.
