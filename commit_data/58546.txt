    runtime: mapiter linkname compatibility layer
    
    This CL reintroduces the various mapiter* linkname functions with a
    compatibility layer that is careful to maintain compatibility with users
    of the linkname.
    
    The wrappers are straightforward. Callers of these APIs get an extra
    layer of indirection, with their hiter containing a pointer to the real
    maps.Iter. These users will take a minor performance hit from the extra
    allocation, but this approach should have good long-term
    maintainability.
    
    Fixes #71408.
