    os/exec: return clear error for missing cmd.Path
    
    Following up on CL 403694, there is a bit of confusion about
    when Path is and isn't set, along with now the exported Err field.
    Catch the case where Path and Err (and lookPathErr) are all unset
    and give a helpful error.
    
    Fixes #52574
    Followup after #43724.
