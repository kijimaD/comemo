    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: use explicit block statements for init
    
    For statements like goto that don't need an init, use an
    explicit block statement instead of forcing them to have one.
    
    There is also one call to addinit that is being replaced with
    a block. That call is the source of much of my confusion
    regarding init statements: walkstmt calls addinit on a statement,
    whereas all the other uses of addinit are on expressions.
    
    After this CL, they're all expressions.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
