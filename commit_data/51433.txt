    spec: add a link to Allocation section in section on append built-in
    
    If needed, the built-in function append allocates a new underlying
    array. While we (probably) don't want to specify exactly how much
    is allocated (the prose is deliberately vague), if there's more
    space allocated than needed (cap > len after allocation), that
    extra space is zeroed. Use an explicit link to the section on
    Allocation which explicitly states that newly allocated memory
    is zeroed.
    
    Fixes #56684.
