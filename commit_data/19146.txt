    cmd/ld: attempt at fixing openbsd build
    
    OpenBSD is excluded from all the usual thread-local storage
    code, not just emitting the tbss section in the external link .o
    but emitting a PT_TLS section in an internally-linked executable.
    I assume it just has no proper TLS support. Exclude it here too.
