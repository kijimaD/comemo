    net/textproto: don't treat spaces as hyphens in header keys
    
    This was originally done in https://codereview.appspot.com/5690059
    (Feb 2012) to deal with bad response headers coming back from webcams,
    but it presents a potential security problem with HTTP request
    smuggling for request headers containing "Content Length" instead of
    "Content-Length".
    
    Part of overall HTTP hardening for request smuggling. See RFC 7230.
    
    Thanks to RÃ©gis Leroy for the report.
