    cmd/compile: explicitly disallow mixing -iexport={false,true}
    
    flagiexport currently controls not just whether to use the indexed
    export format when writing out package data, but also how symbol
    import logic works. In particular, it enables lazy loading logic that
    currently doesn't work with packages imported via bimport.
    
    We could change the import logic to base decisions on the export data
    format used by the packages that individual symbols were loaded from,
    but since we expect to deprecate and remove bimport anyway and there's
    no need for mixing bimport and iimport, it's simpler to just disallow
    mixing them.
