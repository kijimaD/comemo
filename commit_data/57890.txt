    net: synchronize calls to Close in the withTCPConnPair test helper
    
    withTCPConnPair is supposed to return only when both peer functions
    have completed. However, due to the use of "defer" it was closing the
    peers' connections after the synchronization point instead of before.
    
    Fixes #62542.
