    runtime/pprof: disable new memory test
    
    It cannot run 'go tool pprof'. There is no guarantee that's installed.
    It needs to build a temporary pprof binary and run that.
    It also needs to skip the test on systems that can't build and
    run binaries, namely android and nacl.
    
    See src/cmd/nm/nm_test.go's TestNM for a template.
    
    Update #8867
    Status: Accepted
