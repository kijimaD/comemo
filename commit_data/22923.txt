    cmd/cgo: add -exportheader option
    
    The -exportheader option tells cgo to generate a header file declaring
    expoted functions.  The header file is only created if there are, in
    fact, some exported functions, so it also serves as a signal as to
    whether there were any.
    
    In future CLs the go tool will use this option to install header files
    for packages that use cgo and export functions.
