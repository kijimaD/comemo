    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: split decompose pass in two
    
    A first pass to decompose user types (structs, maybe
    arrays someday), and a second pass to decompose builtin
    types (strings, interfaces, slices, complex).  David wants
    this for value range analysis so he can have structs decomposed
    but slices and friends will still be intact and he can deduce
    things like the length of a slice is >= 0.
