    net/http: don't send body on redirects for 301, 302, 303 when GetBody is set
    
    The presence of Request.GetBody being set on a request was causing all
    redirected requests to have a body, even if the redirect status didn't
    warrant one.
    
    This bug came from 307/308 support (https://golang.org/cl/29852) which
    removed the line that set req.Body to nil after POST/PUT redirects.
