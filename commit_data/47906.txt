    runtime: expand TestGdbPythonCgo skip to include mips64le
    
    The failure mode in #37794 does not match the failure mode described
    in #18784. However, since the test is currently skipped on all other
    MIPS variants, it may be that they suffer from the same underlying GDB
    bug. Ideally one of the Go MIPS maintainers should file an upstream
    bug and remove the skip once it is fixed; in the meantime, there is no
    point in continuing to let the test fail on just one of the four MIPS
    variants.
    
    For #37794
