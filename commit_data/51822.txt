commit 8427429c592588af8c49522c76b3e0e0e335d270

    os: raise open file rlimit at startup
    
    Some systems set an artificially low soft limit on open file count,
    for compatibility with code that uses select and its hard-coded
    maximum file descriptor (limited by the size of fd_set).
    
    Go does not use select, so it should not be subject to these limits.
    On some systems the limit is 256, which is very easy to run into, even
    in simple programs like gofmt when they parallelize walking a file tree.
    
    After a long discussion on go.dev/issue/46279, we decided the best
    approach was for Go to raise the limit unconditionally for itself, and
    then leave old software to set the limit back as needed. Code that
    really wants Go to leave the limit alone can set the hard limit, which
    Go of course has no choice but to respect.
    
    Take 2, after CL 392415 was rolled back for macOS and OpenBSD failures.
    The macOS failures should be handled by the new call to sysctl("kern.maxfilesperproc"),
    and the OpenBSD failures are handled by skipping the test (and filing #51713).
    
    Fixes #46279.
