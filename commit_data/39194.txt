    crypto/tls: fix TestVerifyHostnameResumed
    
    In TLS 1.3 session tickets are delivered after the handshake, and it
    looks like now the Google servers wait until the first flight of data to
    send them (or our timeout is too low). Cause some data to be sent so we
    can avoid the guessing game.
    
    Fixes #32090
