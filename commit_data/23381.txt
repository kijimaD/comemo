    net/http: silence race detector on client header timeout test
    
    When running the client header timeout test, there is a race between
    us timing out and waiting on the remaining requests to be serviced. If
    the client times out before the server blocks on the channel in the
    handler, we will be simultaneously adding to a waitgroup with the
    value 0 and waiting on it when we call TestServer.Close().
    
    This is largely a theoretical race. We have to time out before we
    enter the handler and the only reason we would time out if we're
    blocked on the channel. Nevertheless, make the race detector happy
    by turning the close into a channel send. This turns the defer call
    into a synchronization point and we can be sure that we've entered
    the handler before we close the server.
    
    Fixes #10780
