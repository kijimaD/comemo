    cmd/compile: fix a premature-deallocation of state in loopreschedchecks
    
    lastMems is free-ed before it's actually used. This results in the pass
    breaking: multiple mem phis will present in the instrumented ssa, and
    essentially break tighten
    pass(https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/cmd/compile/internal/ssa/tighten.go;l=240).
    
    This CL fix that.
