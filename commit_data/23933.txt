    net: make LookupIP("1.2.3.4") behavior consistent
    
    To date, the behavior has depended on whether we're using cgo and
    in turn what the host resolver does. Most host resolvers will "resolve"
    IP addresses, but the non-cgo pure Go path has not.
    This CL makes resolution of IP addresses always work, even if we're not using cgo
    and even if the host resolver does not "resolve" IP addresses.
    
    Fixes #11335.
