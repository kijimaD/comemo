    cmd/internal/obj/mips: fix encoding of FCR registers
    
    The asm encoder generally assumes that the lowest 5 bits of the
    REG_XX constants match the machine instruction encoding, i.e.
    the lowest 5 bits is the register number. This was not true for
    FCR registers and M registers. Make it so.
    
    MOV Rx, FCRy was encoded as two machine instructions. The first
    is unnecessary. Remove.
