    test: deflaking measures for runtime gdb test
    
    Tweak the runtime's GDB python test to try to reduce flake failures.
    
    Background: the intent of the testpoint in question is to make sure
    that python-supported commands like "info goroutines" or "goroutine 1
    backtrace" work properly. The Go code being run under the debugger as
    part of the test is single-threaded, but the test is written assuming
    that in addition to the primary goroutine there will be other
    background goroutines available (owned by the runtime). The flakiness
    seems to crop up the most when requesting a backtrace for one of these
    background goroutines; the speculation is that if we catch a
    runtime-owned goroutine in an odd state, this could interfere with the
    test.
    
    The change in this patch is to explicitly start an additional
    goroutine from the main thread, so that when the debugger stops the
    main thread we can be sure that there is some other non-main goroutine
    in a known state.
