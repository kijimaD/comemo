    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: better error when an assignment is used in value context
    
    The error message is now positioned at the statement position (which is
    an identifing token, such as the '=' for assignments); and in case of
    assignments it emphasizes the assignment by putting the Lhs and Rhs
    in parentheses. Finally, the wording is changed from "use of * as value"
    to the stronger "cannot use * as value" (for which there is precedent
    elsewhere in the parser).
    
    Fixes #36858.
