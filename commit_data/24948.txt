    fmt: allow any type in a format's width argument
    
    The construction
            fmt.Printf("%*d", n, 4)
    reads the argument n as a width specifier to use when printing 4.
    Until now, only strict int type was accepted here and it couldn't
    be fixed because the fix, using reflection, broke escape analysis
    and added an extra allocation in every Printf call, even those that
    do not use this feature.
    
    The compiler has been fixed, although I am not sure when exactly,
    so let's fix Printf and then write
    
    Fixes #10732.
