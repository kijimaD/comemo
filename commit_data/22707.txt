    cmd/7g: reserve registers R26 to R32
    
    These registers are not available for programs to use. Prior to this
    change, the compiler would crash attempting to use ZR as a general
    purpose register. Other programs would compile but on execution would
    overwrite the G register and cause havoc.
    
    Fixes linux/arm64 build.
    Fixes #10304
    Fixes #10320
