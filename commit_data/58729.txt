    cmd/go: use local go cache for cover_statements script test
    
    Use a test-local directory for GOCACHE in "cover_statements" script
    test, as a workaround for issue 64014.
    
    For the portion of this test that verifies that caching works
    correctly, the cache should theoretically always behave
    reliably/deterministically, however if other tests are concurrently
    accessing the cache while this test is running, it can lead to cache
    lookup failures, which manifest as a flaky failure. To avoid such
    flakes, use a separate isolated GOCACHE for this test.
    
    For #64014.
