    runtime: allocate GC workbufs from manually-managed spans
    
    Currently the runtime allocates workbufs from persistent memory, which
    means they can never be freed.
    
    Switch to allocating them from manually-managed heap spans. This
    doesn't free them yet, but it puts us in a position to do so.
    
    For #19325.
