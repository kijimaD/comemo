    fmt: avoid reflect.Value.Slice to help escape analysis
    
    This is part of a series of CLs that aim to reduce how often
    interface arguments escape for the print functions in fmt.
    
    Prior to this change, one reason arguments escape is because
    printValue calls reflect.Value.Slice, which causes its
    value argument to escape (though at this CL, that is
    shrouded in the fmt escape analysis logs by other
    printValue escape reasons).
    
    This CL avoids that usage by calling f.Bytes instead,
    which is possible because we know f is a slice of bytes
    or an addressable array of bytes.
    
    Arguments still escape for other reasons.
