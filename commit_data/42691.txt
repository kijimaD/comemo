    [dev.link] cmd/link: remove sym.Symbol based host object support
    
    We have converted all the host object readers to the new loader
    based mechanism, and no longer do sym.Symbol host object loading.
    Remove that support. So we don't have to take care of that in
    future changes to the loader.
    
    TODO: there are still code outside the loader than can be
    removed. This CL only focuses on the loader.
