    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: fix assembly of SRADCC with immediate
    
    sradi and sradi. hide the top bit of their immediate argument apart from the
    rest of it, but the code only handled the sradi case.
    
    I'm pretty sure this is the only instruction missing (a couple of the rotate
    instructions encode their immediate the same way but their handling looks OK).
    
    This fixes the failure of "GOARCH=amd64 ~/go/bin/go install -v runtime" as
    reported in the bug.
    
    Fixes #11987
