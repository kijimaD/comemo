    os: fix TestRenameCaseDifference
    
    Saw this failing on windows like this:
    
            --- FAIL: TestRenameCaseDifference (2.96s)
            --- FAIL: TestRenameCaseDifference/dir (1.64s)
                testing.go:1226: TempDir RemoveAll cleanup: remove C:\Users\gopher\AppData\Local\Temp\1\TestRenameCaseDifferencedir1375918868\001: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
            --- FAIL: TestRenameCaseDifference/file (1.32s)
                testing.go:1226: TempDir RemoveAll cleanup: remove C:\Users\gopher\AppData\Local\Temp\1\TestRenameCaseDifferencefile3272269402\001: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
            FAIL
    
    The reason might be the directory fd is not closed. This may be
    mitigated by retries in removeAll function from testing package,
    but apparently it does not succeed all the time.
    
    A link to the failed run which made me look into this: https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/golang/builders/try/gotip-windows-386/b8770439049015378129/overview
