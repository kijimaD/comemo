    [dev.link] cmd/link: begin splitting up dodata()
    
    Begin refactoring dodata to try to convert it from a single giant blob
    to something more hierarchical, with descriptive function names for
    sub-parts.
    
    Add a state object to hold things like "data" and "dataMaxAlign"
    arrays that are used throughout dodata. Extract out the code that
    allocates data symbols to sections into a separate method (this
    method is still too big, probably needs to be refactored again).
    
    No change in functionality.
