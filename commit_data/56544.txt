    cmd/dist: use registerStdTestSpecially for normal Go tests only
    
    It was my oversight in CL 463276 to skip registerStdTestSpecially
    packages in the race bench test registration loop. Package testdir
    has no benchmarks and doesn't need to be skipped. (And if it had
    benchmarks, it's very unlikely they'd need any special handling.)
    
    By now there are more cmd/cgo/internal/... packages that are registered
    specially, and there isn't a need for their few benchmarks not to be
    used for the purpose of race bench tests. If the 3 benchmarks in
    cmd/cgo/internal/test were to require something special, then we can
    add it to a new registerRaceBenchTestSpecially map with a comment, and
    do register them specially in registerTests instead of forgetting to.
    
    This restores the automatic 'go_test_bench:cmd/cgo/internal/test'
    registration and reduces prevalence of registerStdTestSpecially a bit.
    
    For #37486.
    For #56844.
