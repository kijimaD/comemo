    runtime/cgo: raise the thread-local storage slot search limit on Android
    
    On Android, the thread local offset is found by looping through memory
    starting at the TLS base address. The search is limited to
    PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX, but issue 19472 made it clear that in some cases, the
    slot is located further from the TLS base.
    
    The limit is merely a sanity check in case our assumptions about the
    thread-local storage layout are wrong, so this CL raises it to 384, which
    is enough for the test case in issue 19472.
    
    Fixes #19472
