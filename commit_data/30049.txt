    cmd/go: allow 'go generate' even if imports do not resolve
    
    Maybe the go generate is generating the imports,
    or maybe there's some other good reason the code
    is incomplete.
    
    The help text already says:
    
            Note that go generate does not parse the file, so lines that look
            like directives in comments or multiline strings will be treated
            as directives.
    
    We'll still reject Go source files that don't begin with a package statement
    or have a syntax error in the import block, but those are I think more
    defensible rejections.
    
    Fixes #16307.
