    cmd/gc: rewrite argtype to substitute in a single pass
    
    Substituting in multiple passes meant walking the type
    multiple times, and worse, if a complex type was substituted
    in an early pass, later passes would follow it, possibly recursively,
    until hitting the depth 10 limit.
