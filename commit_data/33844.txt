    net: increase timeout for TestDialerDualStackFDLeak
    
    This test has been getting occasional timeouts on the race builder.
    The point of the test is whether a file descriptor leaks, not whether
    the connection occurs in a certain amount of time. So use a very large
    timeout. The connection is normally fast and the timeout doesn't matter.
