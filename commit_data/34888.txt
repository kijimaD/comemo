    net: fix LookupTXT of long records on Windows
    
    The response to a TXT lookup is a sequence of RRs,
    each of which contains a sequence of string fragments.
    
    The correct handling of the response is to do:
    
        for each rr {
            list = append(list, strings.Join(rr.fragments, ""))
        }
    
    (like in at dnsRR_TXT.Walk, used on most platforms).
    
    The Windows code incorrectly does:
    
        for each rr {
            list = append(list, rr.fragments...)
        }
    
    This CL fixes it to concatenate fragments, as it must.
    
    Fixes #21472.
