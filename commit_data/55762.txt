    runtime: change timer.status to timer.state
    
    The status enumeration is simple enough now that we can
    view it as a bit set instead. Switch to a bit set, freeing up
    the remaining bits for use in followup work to allow
    garbage-collecting timers.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
