    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: add initial README
    
    This is the first version of an introductory document that should help
    developers who want to get started with this package.
    
    I recently started poking around this part of the compiler, and was
    confused by a few basic ideas such as memory arguments. I also hadn't
    heard about GOSSAFUNC until another developer pointed it out. Both of
    those are essential if one wants to do any non-trivial work here.
    
    This document can of course be expanded with more pointers and tips to
    better understand this package's code and behavior. Its intent is not to
    cover all of its features; but it should be enough for most developers
    to start playing with it without extensive compiler experience.
