    cmd/compile,runtime: update instrumentation comments
    
    The compiler's instrumentation pass has some out-of-date comments
    about the write barrier and some confusing comments about
    typedslicecopy. Update these comments and add a comment to
    typedslicecopy explaining why it's manually instrumented while none of
    the other operations are.
