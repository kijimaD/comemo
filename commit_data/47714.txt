    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: small bug fixes and refactors to minimization
    
    This fixes a few issues that were being masked since
    log statements weren't being printed to stdout. Now
    that they are, fix the bugs, and update the tests.
    
    Also includes a few small refactors which will make
    minimizing non-recoverable errors easier.
