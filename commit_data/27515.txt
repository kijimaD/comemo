    cmd/link: remove -H elf flag
    
    We create appropriate ELF files automatically based on GOOS. There's
    no point in supporting -H elf flag, particularly since we need to emit
    different flavors of ELF depending on GOOS anyway.
    
    If that weren't reason enough, -H elf appears to be broken since at
    least Go 1.4. At least I wasn't able to find a way to make use of it.
    
    As best I can tell digging through commit history, -H elf is just an
    artifact leftover from Plan 9's 6l linker.
