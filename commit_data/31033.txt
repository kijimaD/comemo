    syscall: export Fsid.X__val on s390x
    
    mkpost.go replaces all variables prefixed with 'X_' with '_' on s390x
    because most of them do not need to be exposed. X__val is being used
    by a third party library so it turns out we do need to expose it on
    s390x (it is already exposed on all other Linux architectures).
    
    Fixes #17298 and updates #18632.
