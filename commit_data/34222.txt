    runtime: fix various contiguous bitmap assumptions
    
    There are various places that assume the heap bitmap is contiguous and
    scan it sequentially. We're about to split up the heap bitmap. This
    commit modifies all of these except heapBitsSetType to use the
    heapBits abstractions so they can transparently switch to a
    discontiguous bitmap.
    
    Updates #10460. This is a step toward supporting sparse heaps.
