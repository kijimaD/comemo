    runtime: overwrite startupRand instead of clearing it
    
    AT_RANDOM is unfortunately used by libc before we run (so make sure it's
    not cleared) but also is available to cgo programs after we did. It
    would be unfortunate if a cgo program assumed it could use AT_RANDOM but
    instead found all zeroes there.
