    runtime: explicitly keep handle alive during getOrAddWeakHandle
    
    getOrAddWeakHandle is very careful about keeping its input alive across
    the operation, but not very careful about keeping the heap-allocated
    handle it creates alive. In fact, there's a window in this function
    where it is *only* visible via the special. Specifically, the window of
    time between when the handle is stored in the special and when the
    special actually becomes visible to the GC.
    
    (If we fail to add the special because it already exists, that case is
    fine. We don't even use the same handle value, but the one we obtain
    from the attached GC-visible special, *and* we return that value, so it
    remains live.)
    
    Fixes #70455.
