    [dev.cmdgo] cmd/link: fix TestBuildForTvOS
    
    This test was broken in CL 334732 on darwin.
    
    The test invokes 'go build' with a CC containing the arguments
    -framework CoreFoundation. Previously, the go command split CC on
    whitespace, and inserted the arguments after the command line when
    running CC directly. Those arguments weren't passed to cgo though,
    so cgo ran CC without -framework CoreFoundation (or any of the other
    flags).
    
    In CL 334732, we pass CC through to cgo, and cgo splits arguments
    using str.SplitQuotedFields. So -framework CoreFoundation actually
    gets passed to the C compiler. It appears that -framework flags are
    only meant to be used in linking operations, so when cgo invokes clang
    with -E (run preprocessor only), clang emits an error that -framework
    is unused.
    
    This change fixes the test by moving -framework CoreFoundation out of
    CC and into CGO_LDFLAGS.
