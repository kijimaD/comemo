    misc/cgo/stdio: split stdout/stderr into a separate file
    
    Split stdout/stderr into a separate file so that can be handled
    differently on some platforms. Both NetBSD and OpenBSD have defines
    for stdout/stderr that require some coercion in order for cgo to
    handle them correctly.
