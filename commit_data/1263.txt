commit cb67a8324bbdffcb5e8a8a6caa8dbb400d0dc7a8
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 2 16:49:44 2008 -0800

    - fine-tuning of white space
    - by default consider extra newlines in src for better formatting
    - additional flags for control (-newlines, -maxnewlines, -optsemicolons)
    - don't print ()'s around single anonymous result types
    
    Status: Comparing the output of pretty with the input for larger files
    shows mostly whitespace/formatting differences, which is what is desired.
    
    TODO:
    - Handling of overlong lines
    - some esoteric cases which look funny
