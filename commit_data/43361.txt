    net/http: use DOMException.message property in error text
    
    Previously, details about the underlying fetch error
    were not visible in the net/http error text:
    
            net/http: fetch() failed: <object>
    
    When using the message property, they are:
    
            net/http: fetch() failed: Failed to fetch
            net/http: fetch() failed: The user aborted a request.
