    runtime: don't re-initialize itab while looking for missing function
    
    The itab we're initializing again, just to figure out which method
    is missing, might be stored in read-only memory.
    This can only happen in certain weird generics situations, so it is
    pretty rare, but it causes a runtime crash when it does happen.
    
    Fixes #65962
