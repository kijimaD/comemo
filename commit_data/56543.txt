    test: add escape test for reflect.Value operations
    
    With CL 408826 reflect.Value does not always escape. We need to
    make sure Value operations does (or does not) escape the Value
    correctly. This CL adds a test.
    
    There are still a few unfortunate cases, where some Value
    operations escape more than necessary (comparing to a non-reflect
    version of the code), but hard to fix. These are mostly that a
    Value would escape conditionally (mostly on the type of the Value),
    but currently we don't have a good way to express that.
