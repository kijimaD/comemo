    cmd/go: put computed GOROOT in built binaries
    
    As of CL 42533, cmd/go will recompute its GOROOT based on the
    location of its own executable. This CL plumbs that computed GOROOT
    into every binary it builds using the linker -X flag. This
    means binaries built with a moved cmd/go will report the GOROOT
    they were built in from runtime.GOROOT().
    
    Fixes #21313
