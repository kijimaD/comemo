    cmd/dist: ignore packages with no Go files in BenchmarkAll
    
    This case recently started happening on the builders.
    The synctest experiment was recently enabled for some targets (CL 642422).
    This caused the list of standard packages to include testing/synctest.
    However, BenchmarkAll tests for all configurations;
    some did not include testing/synctest. That caused the test to crash.
