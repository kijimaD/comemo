    all: final merge of NaCl tree
    
    This CL replays the following one CL from the rsc-go13nacl repo.
    This is the last replay CL: after this CL the main repo will have
    everything the rsc-go13nacl repo did. Changes made to the main
    repo after the rsc-go13nacl repo branched off probably mean that
    NaCl doesn't actually work after this CL, but all the code is now moved
    over and just needs to be redebugged.

    cmd/6l, cmd/8l, cmd/ld: support for Native Client
    
    See golang.org/s/go13nacl for design overview.
    
    This CL is publicly visible but not CC'ed to golang-dev,
    to avoid distracting from the preparation of the Go 1.2
    release.
    
    This CL and the others will be checked into my rsc-go13nacl
    clone repo for now, and I will send CLs against the main
    repo early in the Go 1.3 development.
