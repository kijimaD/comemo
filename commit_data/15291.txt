    exp/cookiejar: make cookie sorting deterministic.
    
    Re-enable TestUpdateAndDelete, TestExpiration, TestChromiumDomain and
    TestChromiumDeletion on Windows.
    
    Sorting of cookies with same path length and same creation
    time is done by an additional seqNum field.
    This makes the order in which cookies are returned in Cookies
    deterministic, even if the system clock is manipulated or on
    systems with a low-resolution clock.
    
    The tests now use a synthetic time: This makes cookie testing
    reliable in case of bogus system clocks and speeds up the
    expiration tests.
