    syscall: fix IPv6 wrong network mask on latest FreeBSD
    
    Looks like latest FreeBSD doesn't set address family identifer
    for RTAX_NETMASK stuff; probably RTAX_GENMASK too, not confirmed.
    This CL tries to identify address families by using the length of
    each socket address if possible.
    
    The issue is confirmed on FreeBSD 9.1.
