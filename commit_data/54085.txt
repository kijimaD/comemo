    cmd/compile/internal/walk: remove reduceSlice
    
    After CL 22425, there're two optimizations for slice expr which are
    never applied during walk pass:
    
            s[i:len(s)]
            s[i:j:cap(s)]
    
    The order pass have already rewritten len/cap expression to use autotmp,
    thus the same safe expression check will never fire. The code can now be
    simplified by moving the only case left from reduceSlice to walkSlice,
    then removing reduceSlice entirely.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
