    cmd/go: run cover tool before swig
    
    When building a package, run the cover tool on the collected go/cgo
    source files before invoking swig (if swig files are present), as
    opposed to running swig and then cover. Running swig adds new Go files
    to the "cgo" list, and we want to avoid running those newly generated
    files through the cover tool.
    
    Fixes #64661.
