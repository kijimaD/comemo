    go/types: add CheckExpr function to type-check an expression
    
    In IDE-like applications (and also in tests), there is often a need to
    type-check an expression as if it appeared at a particular position in
    the source code of an already typed-checked package.
    
    Eval was added to address this need, but did so only partially,
    stopping short of exposing a type-annotated expression tree. This
    makes it impossible to resolve an expression such as new(T).x and
    discover what Object x refers to.  CheckExpr exposes that generality.
    Eval is now implemented in terms of CheckExpr.
    
    This change includes a test that demonstrates the object resolution
    functionality just described.
