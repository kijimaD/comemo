    cmd/go/internal/load: recompute test variant's build info if necessary
    
    The buildinfo used for a testmain is a copy from the buildinfo produced
    for the package under test, and that in turn is only computed if the
    package under test is package main. If there are //go:debug directives
    in a test file for package main, the godebugs for the testmain (which
    are computed using the regular package files as well as the test files'
    //go:debug directives) will be different from those used to produce the
    buildinfo of the package under test (computed using the //go:debug
    directives only in the main package). In that case, recompute the
    buildinfo for the testmain to incorporate the new godebug information.
    
    Since we've only been generating buildinfo for tests on package main, in
    this CL we'll only recompute the buildinfo if the test is for package
    main. It's not clear to me though if we should be computing the
    buildinfo for all test mains (or none of them?)
    
    Fixes #68053
