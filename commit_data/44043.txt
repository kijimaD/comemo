    test: for issue11656 try to execute trap, not call it
    
    The issue11656 code was using the trap instruction as a PC value,
    but it is intended to call a PC value that contains the trap instruction.
    
    It doesn't matter too much as in practice the address is not
    executable anyhow. But may as well have the code act the way it
    is documented to act.
    
    Also, don't run the test with gccgo/GoLLVM, as it can't work.
    The illegal instruction will have no unwind data, so the unwinder
    won't be able to get past it. In other words, gccgo/GoLLVM suffer
    from the exact problem that the issue describes, but it seems insoluble.
    
    For golang/go#11656
