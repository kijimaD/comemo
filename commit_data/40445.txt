    cmd/go: convert semver tags with metadata to pseudoversions
    
    Some repositories include tags like 'v1.0.0-rc.1+oryOS.9'.
    
    If we were to allow such tags, they could become ambiguous: semantic
    versioning defines versions that differ only in metadata to have equal
    precedence, so if someone added a tag 'v1.0.0-rc.1+other' at a
    different commit, then the version 'v1.0.0-rc.1' would become
    ambiguous.
    
    However, we should still allow those tags to be used to resolve
    versions, and since we can even parse the underlying semantic version,
    we can at least use that as the basis for a unique (and well-ordered)
    pseudo-version.
    
    Fixes #31713
