    crypto/x509: revert serial length restriction
    
    This reverts CL400377, which restricted serials passed to
    x509.CreateCertificate to <= 20 octets. Unfortunately this turns out to
    be something _a lot_ of people get wrong. Since it's not particularly
    obvious how to properly generate conformant serials, until we provide
    an easier way for people to get this right, reverting this restriction
    makes sense (possible solution discussed in #52444.)
