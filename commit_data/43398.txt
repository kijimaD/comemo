    io: adopt Discard, NopCloser, ReadAll from io/ioutil
    
    As proposed and approved in #40025, Discard, NopCloser, and ReadAll
    do not really fit into io/ioutil, which exists mainly to hold things that
    would cause an import cycle if implemented in io itself, which is to say
    things that import "os".
    
    These three do not import "os" - they are generic io helpers like
    many of the things in io itself, so it makes sense for them to be there.
    
    Fixes #40025.
