    runtime: move timer recheck after GC recheck
    
    When rechecking for work after transitioning from a spinning to
    non-spinning M, checking timers before GC isn't useful. That is, if
    there is GC work available, it will run immediately and the updated
    pollUntil is unused.
    
    Move this check to just before netpoll, where pollUntil is used. While
    this technically improves efficiency in the (rare) case that we find
    GC work in this block, the primary motivation is simply to improve
    clarity by moving the update closer to use.
    
    For #43997
