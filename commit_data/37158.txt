    net/http: in Transport, don't error on non-chunked response with Trailer header
    
    There are cases where HTTP message specifies the Trailer header
    but not the Transfer-Encoding = chunked. The existing
    implementation would return an error in those cases, without
    returning also the message itself.
    Instead, it would be preferable to let the library user decide when
    the message is valid or not.
    This change makes the fixTrailer() function not to return an error
    and to keep the Trailer value in the Response.Header map but not
    populate Response.Trailer.
    
    Fixes #27197
