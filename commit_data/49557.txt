    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: fix BITCON constant printing error
    
    For some 32-bit instructions whose first operand is a constant, we
    copy the lower 32 bits of the constant into the upper 32 bits in progedit,
    which leads to the wrong value being printed in -S output.
    
    The purpose of this is that we don't need to distinguish between 32-bit
    and 64-bit constants when checking C_BITCON, this CL puts the modified
    value in a temporary variable, so that the constant operand of the
    instruction will not be modified.
    
    Fixes #53551
