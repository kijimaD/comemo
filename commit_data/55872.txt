    runtime: rename timers fields for clarity
    
    These names were copied over from the p field names,
    but now that they are part of the timers type they can use
    shorter names that make the relationship clearer.
    
    timer0When -> minWhen
    timerModifiedEarliest -> minNextWhen
    
    This code change is only the renaming.
