    all: join a few chained ifs
    
    I had been finding these over a year or so, but none were big enough
    changes to warrant CLs. They're a handful now, so clean them all up in a
    single commit.
    
    The smaller bodies get a bit simpler, but most importantly, the larger
    bodies get unindented.
