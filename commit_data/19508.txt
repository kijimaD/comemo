    cmd/ld: fix PC deltas in DWARF line number table
    
    The putpclcdelta function set the DWARF line number PC to
    s->value + pcline->pc, which is correct, but the code then set
    the local variable pc to epc, which can be a different value.
    This caused the next delta in the DWARF table to be wrong.
    
    Fixes #8098.
