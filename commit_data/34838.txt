    bytes: make all readOp constants actually typed
    
    This is a regression introduced in golang.org/cl/28817. That change got
    rid of the iota, which meant that the type was no longer applied to all
    the constant names.
    
    Re-add the iota starting at -1, simplifying the code and adding the
    types once more.
