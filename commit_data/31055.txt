    runtime: prevent TLS fetching instructions from being assembled on NaCl/ARM
    
    They are dead code already, but the verifier is still not happy.
    Don't assemble them at all.
    
    Looks like it has been like that for long. I don't know why it
    was ok. Maybe the verifier is now more picky?
    
    Fixes #19884.
