    compress/bzip2: make decoding faster
    
    Issue 6754 reports that Go bzip2 Decode function is much slower
    (about 2.5x in go1.5) than the Python equivalent (which is
    actually just a wrapper around the usual C library) on random data.
    
    Profiling the code shows that half a dozen of CMP instructions in a
    tight loop are responsibile for most of the execution time.
    
    This patch reduces the number of branches of the loop, greatly
    improving performance on random data and speeding up decoding of
    real data.

    I've run some benchmark comparing Go bzip2 implementation with the
    usual Linux bzip2 command (which is written in C). On my machine
    this patch brings go1.5
      from ~2.26x to ~1.50x of bzip2 time (on 64MB  random data)
      from ~1.70x to ~1.50x of bzip2 time (on 100MB english text)
      from ~2.00x to ~1.88x of bzip2 time (on 64MB  /dev/zero data)
    
    Fixes #6754
