    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: remove fmt_test code; it has outlived its usefulness
    
    With the recent compiler rewrites and cleanups to gc/fmt.go, the
    "safety net" provided by fmt_test has become less important and
    the test itself has become a burden (often breaks because of small
    format changes elsewhere).
    
    Eventually, the syntax and types2 packages will provide most error
    and diagnostic compiler output at which point fmt.go can be further
    simplified as well.
