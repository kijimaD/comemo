    syscall/plan9: remove spooky fd action at a distance
    
    Change Plan 9 fork/exec to use the O_CLOEXEC file
    descriptor, instead of relying on spooky at a
    distance.
    
    Historically, Plan 9 has set the O_CLOEXEC flag on
    the underlying channels in the kernel, rather
    than the file descriptors -- if two fds pointed
    at a single channel, as with dup, changing the
    flags on one of them would be observable on the
    other.
    
    The per-Chan semantics are ok, if unexpected,
    when a chan is only handled within a single
    process, but this isn't always the case.
    
    Forked processes share Chans, but even more of
    a problem is the interaction between /srv and
    OCEXEC, which can lead to unexectedly closed
    file descriptors in completely unrelated
    proceses. For example:
    
            func exists() bool {
                    // If some other thread execs here,
                    // we don't want to leak the fd, so
                    // open it O_CLOEXEC
                    fd := Open("/srv/foo", O_CLOEXEC)
                    if fd != -1 {
                            Close(fd)
                            return true
                    }
                    return false
            }
    
    would close the connection to any file descriptor
    (maybe even for the root fs) in ALL other processes
    that have it open if an exec were to happen(!),
    which is quite undesriable.
    
    As a result, 9front will be changing this behavior
    for the next release.
    
    Go is the only code observed so far that relies on
    this behavior on purpose, and  It's easy to make the
    code work with both semantics: simply using the file
    descriptor that was opened with O_CEXEC instead of
    throwing it away.
    
    So we do that here.
    
    Fixes #43524
