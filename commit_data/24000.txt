    runtime: run on GOARM=5 and GOARM=6 uniprocessor freebsd/arm systems
    
    Also, crash early on non-Linux SMP ARM systems when GOARM < 7;
    without the proper synchronization, SMP cannot work.
    
    Linux is okay because we call kernel-provided routines for
    synchronization and barriers, and the kernel takes care of
    providing the right routines for the current system.
    On non-Linux systems we are left to fend for ourselves.
    
    It is possible to use different synchronization on GOARM=6,
    but it's too late to do that in the Go 1.5 cycle.
    We don't believe there are any non-Linux SMP GOARM=6 systems anyway.
    
    Fixes #12067.
