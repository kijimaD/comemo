    go/types: record all instances, not just inferred instances
    
    This change modifies the way we record instance information. It changes
    the Info.Inferred map to use the instantiated *ast.Ident as its key, and
    record information for all instances, not just those that were produced
    via function type inference. Accordingly, Info.Inferred is renamed to
    Info.Instances, and the Inferred type is renamed to Instance, with its
    Sig field changed to Type.
    
    This was largely motivated by suggestions from mdempsky on the go/types
    API proposal (#47916). In our analysis, always using the *ast.Ident as
    key and recording all instances makes the API easier to understand and
    use.
    
    Instance.TArgs is also renamed to TypeArgs, consistent with other name
    changes.
