    cmd/link: record missing pcdata tables correctly
    
    The old code was recording the current table output offset,
    so the table from the next function would be used instead of
    the runtime realizing that there was no table at all.
    
    Add debug constant in runtime to check this for every function
    at startup. It's too expensive to do that by default, but we can
    do the last five functions. The end of the table is usually where
    the C symbols end up, so that's where the problems typically are.
    
    Fixes #10747.
    Fixes #11396.
