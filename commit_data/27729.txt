    encoding/json: copy-on-write cacheTypeFields
    
    Swtich from a sync.RWMutex to atomic.Value for cacheTypeFields.
    
    On GOARCH=386, this recovers most of the remaining performance
    difference from the 1.6 release. Compared with tip on linux/386:
    
            name            old time/op    new time/op    delta
            CodeDecoder-40    92.8ms ± 1%    87.7ms ± 1%  -5.50%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    
            name            old speed      new speed      delta
            CodeDecoder-40  20.9MB/s ± 1%  22.1MB/s ± 1%  +5.83%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    
    With more time and care, I believe more of the JSON decoder's work
    could be shifted so it is done before decoding, and independent of
    the number of bytes processed. Maybe someone could explore that for
    Go 1.8.
    
    For #16117.
