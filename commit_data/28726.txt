    doc: update go1.8.txt using new tool
    
    With help of a new interactive commit classifier tool (tool location
    TBD, likely x/build/cmd/writenotes), classify all commits from go1.7
    up to 56d35d4.
    
    We can selectively cull this list later. When in doubt, I erred on the
    side of inclusion for now.
