    net/http: fix detection of Roundtrippers that always error
    
    CL 220905 added code to identify alternate transports that always error
    by using http2erringRoundTripper. This does not work when the transport
    is from another package, e.g., http2.erringRoundTripper.
    Expose a new method that allow detection of such a RoundTripper.
    Switch to an interface that is both a RoundTripper and can return the
    underlying error.
    
    Fixes #40213
