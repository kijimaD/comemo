    runtime: set r12 to sigpanic before jumping to it in sighandler
    
    The ppc64le shared library ABI demands that r12 is set to a function's global
    entrypoint before jumping to the global entrypoint. Not doing so means that
    handling signals that usually panic actually crashes (and so, e.g. can't be
    recovered). Fixes several failures of "cd test; go run run.go -linkshared".
