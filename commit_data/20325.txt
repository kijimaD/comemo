    misc/cgo/testcdefs: comment out test of packed structs
    
    The [568]c compilers no longer support packed structs, so
    using them with -cdefs no longer works.  Just commenting out
    the test, rather than removing it, in case this needs to be
    handled.  It may be that -cdefs can go away entirely in the
    future, in which case so can this directory.
