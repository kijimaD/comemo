    mime/multipart: simplify Part.Read
    
    The basic structure of Part.Read should be simple:
    do what you can with the current buffered data,
    reading more as you need it. Make it that way.
    
    Working entirely in the bufio.Reader's buffer eliminates
    the need for an additional bytes.Buffer.
    
    This structure should be easier to extend in the future as
    more special cases arise.
