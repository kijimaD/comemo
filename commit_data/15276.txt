    runtime/pprof: adjust reported line numbers to show call sites
    
    This is the same logic used in the standard tracebacks.
    The caller pc is the pc after the call, so except in the
    fake "call" caused by a panic, back up the pc enough
    that the lookup will use the previous instruction.
    
    Fixes #4150.
    Fixes #4151.
