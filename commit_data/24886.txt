    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile/internal/ssa: large object load/store vs. vardef
    
    VarDef declarations are getting in the way of rewriting load/store
    pairs into moves.  This change fixes that, albeit in a really hacky way.
    Better options would be appreciated.
    
    Increases coverage during make.bash from 67% to 71%.
