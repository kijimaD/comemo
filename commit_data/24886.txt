    cmd/go: fix build -n when adding to archive with gc toolchain
    
    Fix the output of build -n when adding to an existing archive with the
    gc toolchain by observing that we are, now, always doing that.  When
    using the gc toolchain the archive is now always created by the Go
    compiler, and never by the pack command.
    
    No test because we have not historically tested build -n output.
    
    Fixes #13118.
