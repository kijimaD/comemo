    cmd/compile/internal/types2: list errors by default in TestManual
    
    TestManual is used for debugging; in this case we usually want to
    see error messages reported rather than checked against ERROR comments
    in the provided files. Make this the default. Use the new -verify
    flag to verify reported errors against ERROR comments.
    
    With this change we cannot get an error list for the non-manual
    tests, but that is usually not useful anyway because there are
    usually many errors in those test files. Run those tests manually
    instead.
    
    Also, corrected -lang flag synopsys: it applies to all tests, not
    just TestManual.
