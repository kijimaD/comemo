    cmd/go: depend on runtime/cgo if external linking mode is forced
    
    In external linking mode, the linker automatically imports
    runtime/cgo.  When the user uses non-standard compilation options,
    they have to know to run go install runtime/cgo.  When the go tool
    adds non-standard compilation options itself, we can't force the user
    to do that.  So add the dependency ourselves.
    
    Bad news: we don't currently have a clean way to know whether we are
    going to use external linking mode.  This CL duplicates logic split
    between cmd/6l and cmd/internal/ld.
    
    Good news: adding an unnecessary dependency on runtime/cgo does no
    real harm.  We aren't going to force the linker to pull it in, we're
    just going to build it so that its available if the linker wants it.
