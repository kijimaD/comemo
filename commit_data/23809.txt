    cmd/go: force-overwrite destination files when installing cgo headers
    
    Fixes #11131
    
    When running 'go install -buildmode=c-shared', under the circumstances
    described in issue #11131, the install command would fail trying to
    install cgo headers if they have already been installed (by a previous
    call to 'go install -buildmode=c-shared').
    
    Since it's safe to overwrite said headers (according to iant@), this CL
    introduces a parameter to builder's 'copy' and 'move' functions that,
    if set to 'true', would force the overwriting of already installed
    files.
    
    This parameter value is set to 'true' only when installing cgo headers,
    for now.
