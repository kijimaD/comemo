+
+prof is a rudimentary real-time profiler.
+
+Given a command to run or the process id (pid) of a command already
+running, it samples the program's state at regular intervals and reports
+on its behavior.  With no options, it prints a histogram of the locations
+in the code that were sampled during execution.
+
+Since it is a real-time profiler, unlike a traditional profiler it samples
+the program's state even when it is not running, such as when it is
+asleep or waiting for I/O.  Each thread contributes equally to the
+statistics.
+
+
+Usage: prof -p pid [-t total_secs] [-d delta_msec] [6.out args ...]
+
+The formats (default -h) are:
+
+	-h: histograms
+		How many times a sample occurred at each location
+	-f: dynamic functions
+		At each sample period, print the name of the executing function.
+	-l: dynamic file and line numbers
+		At each sample period, print the file and line number of the executing instruction.
+	-r: dynamic registers
+		At each sample period, print the register contents.
+	-s: dynamic function stack traces
+		At each sample period, print the symbolic stack trace.
+
+Flag -t sets the maximum real time to sample, in seconds, and -d
+sets the sampling interval in milliseconds.  The default is to sample
+every 100ms until the program completes.
+
+For reasons of disambiguation it is installed as 6prof although it also serves
+as an 8prof and a 5prof.
