    testing: add example to package doc
    
    The package doc for the testing package doesn't have a simple
    example demonstrating how to write a test with an expectation. The doc
    has simple examples for benchmarks, examples, and skipping, and it would be
    useful for people new to writing tests in Go.
    
    Also moved the skip example further down because it references tests and
    benchmarks but benchmarks haven't been discussed in detail until the
    next section. Skip is also a less used feature and it seems misplaced to
    sit so high up in the package documentation. As an example, Skip is used
    570 times the Go code repository which is significantly less than Error
    and Fatal that are used 23,303 times.
    
    Also changed 'sample' to 'simple' in other places in the package documentation
    to keep the language used consistent when describing the small examples.
    
    Fixes #27839
