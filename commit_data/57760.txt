    runtime: fix ASAN poison calculation in mallocgc
    
    A previous CL broke the ASAN poisoning calculation in mallocgc by not
    taking into account a possible allocation header, so the beginning of
    the following allocation could have been poisoned.
    
    This mostly isn't a problem, actually, since the following slot would
    usually just have an allocation header in it that programs shouldn't be
    touching anyway, but if we're going a word-past-the-end at the end of a
    span, we could be poisoning a valid heap allocation.
