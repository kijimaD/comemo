    cmd/compile/internal/escape: avoid reading ir.Node during inner loop of walkOne
    
    Broadly speaking, escape analysis has two main phases. First, it
    traverses the AST while building a data-flow graph of locations and
    edges. Second, during "solve", it repeatedly walks the data-flow graph
    while carefully propagating information about each location, including
    whether a location's address reaches the heap.
    
    Once escape analysis is in the solve phase and repeatedly walking the
    data-flow graph, almost all the information it needs is within the
    location graph, with a notable exception being the ir.Class of an
    ir.Name, which currently must be checked by following a pointer from
    the location to its ir.Node.
    
    For typical graphs, that does not matter much, but if the graph becomes
    large enough, cache misses in the inner solve loop start to matter more,
    and the class is checked many times in the inner loop.
    
    We therefore store the class information on the location in the graph
    to reduce how much memory we need to load in the inner loop.
    
    The package github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/internal/checker
    has many locations, and compilation currently spends most of its time
    in escape analysis.
    
    This CL gives roughly a 30% speedup for wall clock compilation time
    for the checker package:
    
      go1.24.0:      91.79s
      this CL:       64.98s
    
    Linux perf shows a healthy reduction for example in l2_request.miss and
    dTLB-load-misses on an amd64 test VM.
    
    We could tweak things a bit more, though initial review feedback
    has suggested it would be good to get this in as it stands.
    
    Subsequent CLs in this stack give larger improvements.
