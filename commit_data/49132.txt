    runtime: store pointer-size words in memclr
    
    GC requires the whole zeroed word to be visible for a memory subsystem.
    While the implementation of Enhanced REP STOSB tries to use as efficient
    stores as possible, e.g writing the whole cache line and not byte-after-byte,
    we should use REP STOSQ to guarantee the requirements of the GC.
    
    The performance is not affected.
