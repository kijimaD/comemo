    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: add tests for BSWAP on stores on AMD64
    
    Commit 10f75748 (CL 32222) taught AMD64 backend to rewrite series of
    byte loads or stores with corresponding shifts into a single long or
    quad load or store + appropriate BSWAP. However it did not added test
    for stores - only loads were tested.
    
    Fix it.
    
    NOTE Tests for indexed stores are not added because 10f75748 did not add
    support for indexed stores - only indexed loads were handled then.
