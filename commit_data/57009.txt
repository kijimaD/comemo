    cmd/compile: add script testing facility for compiler use
    
    Add support for running script tests as part of the compiler's suite
    of tests, hooking in the script test engine packages recently moved
    from cmd/go to cmd/internal. These script tests will use the test
    binary itself as the compile tool for Go builds, and can also run the
    C compiler if needed. New script test cases (*.txt files) should be
    added to the directory cmd/compile/testdata/script.
    
    Updates #68606.
