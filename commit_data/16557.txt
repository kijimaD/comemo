commit 28a1c36d627f179001a9d7180f81d947e6ecdaaf
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 12 18:13:34 2013 -0700

    testing: add -outputdir flag so "go test" controls where the files are written
    Obscure misfeature now fixed: When run from "go test", profiles were always
    written in the package's source directory. This change puts them in the directory
    where "go test" is run.
    Also fix a couple of problems causing errors in testing.after to go unreported
    unless -v was set.
