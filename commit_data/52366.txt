    [dev.boringcrypto] cmd/dist: default to use of boringcrypto
    
    The dev.boringcrypto branch has historically forced use of boringcrypto
    with no additional configuration flags. The previous CL undid that.
    This CL redoes it, so that direct uses of dev.boringcrypto don't lapse
    unexpectedly into not having boringcrypto enabled.
    
    When dev.boringcrypto is merged into master, we will undo this change
    as part of the merge, so that the only final difference between master
    and dev.boringcrypto will be this CL.
    
    For #51940.
