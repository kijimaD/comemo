    cmd/compile: for tail calls in stubs, ensure args are alive
    
    The generated code for interface stubs sometimes just messes
    with a few of the args and then tail-calls to the target routine.
    The args that aren't explicitly modified appear to not be used.
    But they are used, by the thing we're tail calling.
    
    Fixes #16016
