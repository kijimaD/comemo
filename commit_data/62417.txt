    cmd/go/internal/modindex: clean modroot and pkgdir for openIndexPackage
    
    GetPackage is sometimes called with a modroot or pkgdir that ends with a
    path separator, and sometimes without. Clean them before passing them to
    openIndexPackage to deduplicate calls to mcache.Do and action entry
    files.
    
    This shouldn't affect #71698 but was discovered while debugging that
    issue.
