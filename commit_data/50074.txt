    debug/gosym: run TestPCLine on Linux/AMD64 in short mode
    
    Currently TestPCLine is skipped in short mode. The test builds a
    Linux/AMD64 binary, so it makes sense to skip it if we're cross
    compiling, as building the runtime takes a while. But if we are
    on Linux/AMD64, it will only build a small amount of code, which
    isn't really slow. The test runs in 0.14 second on my machine.
    I think it is acceptable to run in short mode. Then we'll have
    trybot coverage for this test.
