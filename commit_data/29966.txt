    go/ast: fix Object's doc comment about Data
    
    The doc comment about the Data field of go/ast.Object reflects its old
    behavior, from when the go/types typechecker depended on ast.Objects.
    
    Since when the doc was written, the behavior has changed in
    https://golang.org/cl/7058060 and https://golang.org/cl/7096048 .
    
    Fixes #18631
