    syscall: fix for Plan 9 build
    
    exec_plan9.go:
    . Adjusted return argument to match other changes.
    #mksyscall.pl:
    . Replaced "err = e1" with "err = NewError(e1)".
    * Change abandoned, Russ made a better suggestion involving
      syscall_plan9.go.
    syscall_plan9.go:
    . Removed redundant "err = nil" lines.
    . Adjusted //sys lines for mksyscall.pl.
    * Replaced "err string" with "err ErrorString" in return arguments.
    zsyscall_plan9_386.go:
    . This module ought to be generated, but as it exists in the
      repository, I rebuilt it and checked that it matched expectations.
      Anybody is welcome to remove this from the repository if
      they feel it should go, but remember that not all Plan 9
      installations have a working Perl.
