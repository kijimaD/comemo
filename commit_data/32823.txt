    cmd/compile: add -importcfg to specify import resolution
    
    Allows reading -importmap options from a file instead of putting
    them all on the command line, and adds the ability to specify the
    file location of specific packages. In effect, -importcfg is a generalization
    of and supersedes -importmap, -importsuffix, and -I.
    Of course, those flags will continue to be supported,
    for compatibility with other tools.
    
    Having this flag in Go 1.9 will let us try some experiments involving
    package management without needing guinea pigs to build a
    custom Go toolchain.
    
    This flag also helps with #14271 at some later point.
    
    For #20579.
