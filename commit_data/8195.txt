    crypto/rsa: support > 3 primes.
    
    With full multi-prime support we can support version 1 PKCS#1 private
    keys. This means exporting all the members of rsa.PrivateKey, thus
    making the API a little messy. However there has already been another
    request to export this so it seems to be something that's needed.
    
    Over time, rsa.GenerateMultiPrimeKey will replace rsa.GenerateKey, but
    I need to work on the prime balance first because we're no longer
    generating primes which are a multiples of 8 bits.
    
    Fixes #987.
