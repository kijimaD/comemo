    cmd/dist: run msan test only in testsanitizer on arm64
    
    With latest gcc (7.3.0), misc/cgo/testsanitizer test will fail with reporting sigmentation
    fault when running tsan test. On arm64, tsan is not supported currently and only msan test
    can be run. So skip tsan test on arm64.
    
    What needs to be pointed out is that msan test can be really run when setting clang
    as c/c++ complier.
    
    Fixes #25601
