    runtime: use correct pc to obtain liveness info during stack copy
    
    The old code was using the PC of the instruction after the CALL.
    Variables live during the call but not live when it returns would
    not be seen as live during the stack copy, which might lead to
    corruption. The correct PC to use is the one just before the
    return address. After this CL the lookup matches what mgc0.c does.
    
    The only time this matters is if you have back to back CALL instructions:
    
            CALL f1 // x live here
            CALL f2 // x no longer live
    
    If a stack copy occurs during the execution of f1, the old code will
    use the liveness bitmap intended for the execution of f2 and will not
    treat x as live.
    
    The only way this situation can arise and cause a problem in a stack copy
    is if x lives on the stack has had its address taken but the compiler knows
    enough about the context to know that x is no longer needed once f1
    returns. The compiler has never known that much, so using the f2 context
    cannot currently cause incorrect execution. For the same reason, it is not
    possible to write a test for this today.
    
    CL 83090046 will make the compiler precise enough in some cases
    that this distinction will start mattering. The existing stack growth tests
    in package runtime will fail if that CL is submitted without this one.
    
    While we're here, print the frame PC in debug mode and update the
    bitmap interpretation strings.
