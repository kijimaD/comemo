    internal/cpu: remove option to mark cpu features required
    
    With the removal of SSE2 runtime detection made in
    golang.org/cl/344350 we can remove this mechanism as there
    are no required features anymore.
    
    For making sure CPUs running a go program support all
    the minimal hardware requirements the go runtime should
    do feature checks early in the runtime initialization
    before it is likely any compiler emitted but unsupported
    instructions are used. This is already the case for e.g.
    checking MMX support on 386 arch targets.
