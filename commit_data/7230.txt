    misc: Import/Drop commands for Vim
    
    New ftplugin adds Import and Drop commands for Go buffers
    in Vim.  These commands ensure that the provided package is
    imported (or not imported) in the current Go buffer, using
    proper style and ordering, without moving the cursor.
    
    E.g.
    
        :Import strings
        :ImportAs . strings
        :Drop strings
    
    Two mappings are also introduced to help with the fmt package:
    
        \f => :Import fmt
        \F => :Drop fmt
