    Revert "math/rand: make Perm match Shuffle"
    
    This reverts CL 55972.
    
    Reason for revert: this changes Perm's behavior unnecessarily.
    I asked for this change originally but I now regret it.
    Reverting so that I don't have to justify it in Go 1.10 release notes.
    
    Edited to keep the change to rand_test.go, which seems to have
    been mostly unrelated.
    
    Fixes #22744.
