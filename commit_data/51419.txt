    cmd/api: reduce parallel 'go list' invocations to a constant
    
    'go list' has its own internal parallelism, so invoking in in parallel
    can produce up to quadratic peak memory usage.
    
    Running 'go list' is also very I/O-intensive, so the higher
    parallelism does substantially improve latency; unfortunately, we lack
    a good way to balance latency against memory footprint, so we need to
    sacrifice some latency for reliability.
    
    Fixes #49957.
