    cmd/compile/internal/ir: set Addrtaken on Canonical ONAME too
    
    In CL 522879, I moved the logic for setting Addrtaken from typecheck's
    markAddrOf and ComputeAddrtaken directly into ir.NewAddrExpr. However,
    I took the logic from markAddrOf, and failed to notice that
    ComputeAddrtaken also set Addrtaken on the canonical ONAME.
    
    The result is that if the only address-of expressions were within a
    function literal, the canonical variable never got marked Addrtaken.
    In turn, this could cause the consistency check in ir.Reassigned to
    fail. (Yay for consistency checks turning mistakes into ICEs, rather
    than miscompilation.)
    
    Fixes #62313.
