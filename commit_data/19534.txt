    runtime: revise CL 105140044 (defer nil) to work on Windows
    
    It appears that something about Go on Windows
    cannot handle the fault cause by a jump to address 0.
    The way Go represents and calls functions, this
    never happened at all, until CL 105140044.
    
    This CL changes the code added in CL 105140044
    to make jump to 0 impossible once again.
    
    Fixes #8047. (again, on Windows)
