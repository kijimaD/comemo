    runtime: make runtime.callers walk calling G, not g0
    
    Currently runtime.callers invokes gentraceback with the pc and sp of
    the G it is called from, but always passes g0 even if it was called
    from a regular g. Right now this has no ill effects because
    runtime.callers does not use either callback argument or the
    _TraceJumpStack flag, but it makes the code fragile and will break
    some upcoming changes.
    
    Fix this by lifting the getg() call outside of the systemstack in
    runtime.callers.
