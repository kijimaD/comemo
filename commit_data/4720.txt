commit a0e6f03add91af28cce2f2f5a8ec5d2e859de6f4

    Cosmetic bug or compliance fixes in http.Response.
    
    (1) http.Response must close resp.Body after writing.
    (2) Case when resp.Body != nil and resp.ContentLength = 0 should not be
    treated as an error in Response.Write, because this is what
    ReadResponse often returns.
    (3) Changed body.th to body.hdr for readability.
