    runtime: check transition condition before triggering periodic GC
    
    Currently sysmon triggers periodic GC if GC is not currently running
    and it's been long enough since the last GC. This misses some
    important conditions; for example, whether GC is enabled at all by
    GOGC. As a result, if GOGC is off, once we pass the timeout for
    periodic GC, sysmon will attempt to trigger a GC every 10ms. This GC
    will be a no-op because gcStart will check all of the appropriate
    conditions and do nothing, but it still goes through the motions of
    waking the forcegc goroutine and printing a gctrace line.
    
    Fix this by making sysmon call gcShouldStart to check *all* of the
    appropriate transition conditions before attempting to trigger a
    periodic GC.
    
    Fixes #19247.
