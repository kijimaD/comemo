    runtime: execute memory barrier conditionally when changing netpoll timers
    
    We only need the memory barrier in poll_runtime_pollSetDeadline only
    when one of the timers has fired, which is not the expected case.
    Memory barrier can be somewhat expensive on some archs,
    so execute it only if one of the timers has in fact fired.
