    cmd/link: when pruning methods also prune funcType
    
    Remove method type information for pruned methods from any program
    that does not reflect on methods. This can be a significant saving:
    
            addr2line: -310KB (8.8%)
    
    A future update might want to consider a more aggressive variant of
    this: setting the Type and Func fields of reflect.Method to nil for
    unexported methods. That would shrink cmd/go by 2% and jujud by 2.6%
    but could be considered an API change. So this CL sticks to the
    uncontroversial change.
    
    For #6853.
