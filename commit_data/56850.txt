    cmd/link: don't skip code sign even if dsymutil didn't generate a file
    
    Even if dsymutil didn't generate a file (which should not happen
    with the Apple toolchain with the correct setup), we should not
    skip next steps, e.g. code sign. A return statement makes it exit
    too early.
    
    Updates #68088.
