    io/ioutil: make TestTempFile more robust
    
    The first part of this test tries to confirm that we can't create
    a TempFile in a non-existent directory, but does not ensure that
    the non-existent directory really does not exist.  Instead, let's
    create an empty temp directory, and use a non-existent subdir of
    that.
