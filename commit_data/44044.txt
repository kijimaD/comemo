    cmd/compile: recognize reassignments involving receives
    
    Previously, reassigned was failing to detect reassignments due to
    channel receives in select statements (OSELRECV, OSELRECV2), or due to
    standalone 2-value receive assignments (OAS2RECV). This was reported
    as a devirtualization panic, but could have caused mis-inlining as
    well.
    
    Fixes #43292.
