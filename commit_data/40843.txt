    cmd/go: ignore irrelevant 'go test' failure in TestGoTestRaceInstallCgo
    
    This test runs 'go test -race -i runtime/race' and checks that it did
    not overwrite cmd/cgo.
    
    If GOROOT/pkg is read-only and GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH_race is not
    already populated, as are the conditions if the Go toolchain was
    installed from source as root using 'make.bash', then 'go test -race
    -i' itself will fail because it cannot install packages to GOROOT/pkg.
    
    However, such a failure is not relevant to the test: even if 'go test
    -race -i' fails, we can still verify that it did not incidentally
    overwrite cmd/cgo.
