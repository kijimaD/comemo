    cmd/compile: adopt strong aux typing for some s390x rules
    
    Convert some optimizations rules to strongly-typed versions. So far, I
    have only converted the rules that need no additional changes (i.e: only
    need to change '->' to "=>").
    
    This CL covers the rules from line 478 - line 800 in S390X.rules file.
    Some compare and branch rules also fall in this range, but they were
    already done previously in another CL.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
