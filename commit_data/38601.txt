    cmd/vet: lostcancel: suppress the check in the main.main function
    
    When main.main returns, the process exits, so there's no need to cancel contexts.
    
    This change was initially reviewed as
    https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/106915/4
    but somehow I messed up and committed patchset 5, which was
    effectively empty.
