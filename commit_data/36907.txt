    runtime: fix pprof livelock on arm
    
    On 32-bit architectures without native 64-bit atomic instructions,
    64-bit atomics are emulated using spinlocks. However,
    the sigprof handling code expects to be able to perform
    64-bit atomic operations in signal handlers. Spinning on an
    acquired spinlock in a signal handler leads to a livelock.
    This is issue #20146.
    
    The original fix for #20146 did not include arm in
    the list of architectures that need to work around portability
    issues in the sigprof handler code. The unit test designed to
    catch this issue does not fail on arm builds because arm uses
    striped spinlocks, and thus the livelock takes many minutes
    to reproduce. This is issue #24260. (This patch doesn't completely
    fix #24260 on go1.10.2 due to issue #25785, which is probably
    related to the arm cas kernel helpers. Those have been removed
    at tip.)
    
    With this patch applied, I was able to run the reproducer for
    issue #24260 for more than 90 minutes without reproducing the
    livelock. Without this patch, the livelock took as little as
    8 minutes to reproduce.
    
    Fixes #20146
    Updates #24260
