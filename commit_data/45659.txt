    syscall: document NewCallback and NewCallbackCDecl limitations
    
    Currently NewCallback and NewCallbackCDecl may only be called a limited
    number of times in a single Go process, but this property of the API is
    not documented. This change fixes that, but does not document the
    precise limit to avoid making that limit part of the API, leaving us
    open to increasing or decreasing the limit in the future as needed.
    
    Although the API avoids documenting a limit, it does guarantee a minimum
    callback count so users can rely on at least some amount of callbacks
    working.
    
    Updates #46184.
