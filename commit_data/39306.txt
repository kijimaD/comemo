    cmd/go: replace uses of ioutil.ReadFile with renameio.ReadFile
    
    Windows does not have atomic renames; instead, it produces one of a
    handful of errors in case a read races with a rename.
    
    CL 180219 added a utility function that retries those errors in most
    cases; this change updates the locations that use renameio for writes
    to also use the new renameio.ReadFile function for reads.
    
    It remains possible for a renameio.ReadFile to fail with a spurious
    ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, but with retries in place for the other errors
    (and practical limits on write concurrency) such failures are unlikely
    in practice.
    
    Fixes #32188
