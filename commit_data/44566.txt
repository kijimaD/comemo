    [dev.link] cmd/compile, cmd/asm: add length to hashed symbols
    
    While working on deduplicating pcdata, I found that the following hashed
    symbols would result in the same:
    
    [] == [0,0,0,0....]
    
    This makes using content addressable symbols untenable for pcdata.
    Adding the length to the hash keeps the dream alive.
    
    No difference in binary size (darwin, cmd/compile), spurious
    improvements in DWARF phase memory.
