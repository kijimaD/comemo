    runtime: add pollDesc partial edges
    
    gscan is taken during stack growth, which may occur while pollDesc is
    held.
    
    mallocgc may also be called while pollDesc is held. mallocgc may take
    mheap or mheapSpecial. The former exists, but is out of order; the
    latter is missing.
    
    Fixes #44881
