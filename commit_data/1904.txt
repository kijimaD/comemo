Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 27 19:27:09 2009 -0700

    Significant parser cleanup:
    - commented public interface
    - much better and very precise error messages
    - much better tracing output
    - many more checks (still permits more than just syntactically legal
      programs, but much more is checked that can be checked w/o semantic information)
    - updated with respect to updated AST
    - general cleanup throughout
    
    Parser almost ready for move into lib/go.
