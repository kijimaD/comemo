    go/types: unexport the GoVersion configuration option for Go 1.17
    
    The GoVersion field was added to types.Config as part of the work on
    type parameters. Specifically, it was added to be consistent with
    cmd/compile/internal/types2, which requires such an option.
    
    This configuration option is useful, but is also non-trivial and did not
    go through the proposal process. Unexport it for Go 1.17; we can create
    a proposal to export it for Go 1.18.
    
    Fixes #46296
