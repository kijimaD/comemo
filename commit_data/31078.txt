    cmd/internal/obj/mips: make assembler almost concurrency-safe
    
    CL 39922 made the arm assembler concurrency-safe.
    This CL does the same, but for mips.
    The approach is similar: introduce ctxt0 to hold
    function-local state and thread it through
    the assembler as necessary.
    
    One race remains after this CL, similar to CL 40252.
    
    That race is conceptually unrelated to this refactoring,
    and will be addressed in a separate CL.
    
    Passes toolstash-check -all.
    
    Updates #15756
