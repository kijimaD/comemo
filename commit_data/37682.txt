    encoding/json: inline fieldByIndex
    
    This function was only used in a single place - in the field encoding
    loop within the struct encoder.
    
    Inlining the function call manually lets us get rid of the call
    overhead. But most importantly, it lets us simplify the logic afterward.
    We no longer need to use reflect.Value{} and !fv.IsValid(), as we can
    skip the field immediately.
    
    The two factors combined (mostly just the latter) give a moderate speed
    improvement to this hot loop.
