    cmd/dist: wait for pending tests before exiting
    
    When 'go tool dist test' stops, it was intended that it first wait for
    pending background tests, like a failed compilation waits for pending
    background compiles. But these three lines prevented that.
    Fix by deleting them. (The actual loop already contains the correct
    logic to avoid running the others and to wait for what's left.)
