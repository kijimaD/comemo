    os/exec: create extra threads when starting a subprocess
    
    TestExtraFiles seems to be flaky on GNU/Linux systems when using cgo
    because creating a new thread will call malloc which can create a new
    arena which can open a file to see how many processors there are.
    Try to avoid the flake by creating several new threads at process
    startup time.
    
    For #25628
