    cmd/compile: prevent modification of ONAME/OLITERAL/OTYPES nodes in walkexpr
    
    ONAME, OLITERAL, and OTYPE nodes can be shared between functions.
    In a concurrent backend, such nodes might be walked concurrently
    with being read in other functions.
    Arrange for them to be unmodified by walk.
    
    This is a follow-up to CL 38609.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
    
    Updates #15756
