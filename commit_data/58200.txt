    runtime: don't use atomic store in noteclear on AIX
    
    In CL 163624 we added an atomic store in noteclear on AIX only.
    In the discussion on issue #63384 we think we figured out that the
    real problem was in the implementation of compare-and-swap on ppc64.
    That is fixed by CL 533118, so the atomic store is no longer required.
    
    For #30189
    For #63384
