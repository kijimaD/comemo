    cmd/compile: s.f aliases itself
    
    The change in 20907 fixed varexpr but broke aliased.  After that change,
    a reference to a field in a struct would not be seen as aliasing itself.
    Before that change, it would, but only because all fields in a struct
    aliased everything.
    
    This CL changes the compiler to consider all references to a field as
    aliasing all other fields in that struct.  This is imperfect--a
    reference to one field does not alias another field--but is a simple fix
    for the immediate problem.  A better fix would require tracking the
    specific fields as well.
    
    Fixes #15042.
