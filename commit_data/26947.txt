    cmd/compile: speed up dom checking in cse
    
    Process a slice of equivalent values by setting replaced values to nil
    instead of removing them from the slice to eliminate copying.  Also take
    advantage of the entry number sort to break early once we reach a value
    in a block that is not dominated.
    
    For the code in issue #15112:
    
    Before:
    real    0m52.603s
    user    0m56.957s
    sys     0m1.213s
    
    After:
    real    0m22.048s
    user    0m26.445s
    sys     0m0.939s
    
    Updates #15112
