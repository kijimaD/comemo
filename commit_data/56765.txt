    os/exec: on Windows look for extensions in Run if not already done
    
    CL 512155 fixed #36768, but introduced #62596.
    CL 527820 fixed #62596, but meant that the code failed to look up
    file extensions on Windows for a relative path.
    This CL fixes that problem by recording whether it has already
    looked up file extensions.
    This does mean that if Path is set manually then we do not update
    it with file extensions, as doing that would be racy.
    
    Fixes #66586
