    debug/dwarf: add Entry.AttrField method to get *Field by Attr
    
    Currently, Entry has a Val method that looks up an attribute and
    returns its value. Now that Field has more fields than the attribute
    and its value, it's useful to return the whole Field and let the
    caller retrieve the parts it needs.
    
    This change adds an AttrField method to Entry that does the same
    lookup at Val, but returns the whole *Field rather than just the
    value.
