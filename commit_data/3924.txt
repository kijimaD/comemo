commit 53f485813e3900c4972337844b44f90f3ebd77d0
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    fix for nodeSize computation, used to determine if
    a node fits on one line:
    - for purposes of measuring the node size in text,
      don't generate html or use a styler that could
      generate html as it will lead to overly large
      sizes
    
    A consequence of this bug is that source code displayed
    with godoc may show functions that fit on one line in
    the source on multiple lines.
    
    This change causes no difference to the gofmt formatting
    of any files in src or misc.
