    test/codegen: fix issue with arm64 memmove codegen test
    
    This recently added arm64 memmove codegen check:
    
      func movesmall() {
        // arm64:-"memmove"
        x := [...]byte{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
        copy(x[1:], x[:])
      }
    
    is not correct, for two reasons:
    
    1. regexps are matched from the start of the disasm line (excluding
       line information). This mean that a negative -"memmove" check will
       pass against a 'CALL runtime.memmove' line because the line does
       not start with 'memmove' (its starts with CALL...).
       The way to specify no 'memmove' match whatsoever on the line is
       -".*memmove"
    
    2. AFAIK comments on their own line are matched against the first
       subsequent non-comment line. So the code above only verifies that
       the x := ... line does not generate a memmove. The comment should
       be moved near the copy() line, if it's that one we want to not
       generate a memmove call.
    
    The fact that the test above is not effective can be checked by
    running `go run run.go -v codegen` in the toplevel test directory with
    a go1.10 toolchain (that does not have the memmove-elision
    optimization). The test will still pass (it shouldn't).
    
    This change changes the regexp to -".*memmove" and moves it near the
    line it needs to (not)match.
