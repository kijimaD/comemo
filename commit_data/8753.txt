    mime/multipart: convert Reader from interface to struct
    
    It was always a weird interface but I didn't know what I
    was doing at the time.  rsc questioned me about it then
    but didn't press on it during review.  Then adg bugged me
    about it too recently.
    
    So clean it up. It parallels the Writer struct too.
