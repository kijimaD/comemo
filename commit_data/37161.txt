    cmd/internal/obj/s390x: increase maximum number of loop iterations
    
    The maximum number of 'spanz' iterations that the s390x assembler
    performs to reach a fixed point for relative offsets was 10. This
    turned out to be too aggressive for one example of auto-generated
    fuzzing code. Increase the number of iterations by 10x to reduce
    the likelihood that the limit will be hit again. This limit only
    exists to help find bugs in the assembler.
    
    master at tip does not fail with the example code in the issue, I
    have therefore not submitted it as a test (it is also quite large).
    I tested this change with the example code at the commit given and
    it fixes the issue.
    
    Fixes #25269.
