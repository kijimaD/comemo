    cmd/go: allow go get with local path
    
    Previously, running 'go get' with a local path would correctly
    download the package but fail to install it.
    This is because a sticky error - resulting from discovering that the
    package needed to be downloaded - was still around.
    Theoretically, such sticky errors would be cleared but they weren't
    because the map tracking these errors were indexed with the correct
    canonical import path of the package (e.g. "ex.com/x/pkg") whereas the
    clearing was done with the local path (e.g. "./pkg".)
    
    Always use the canonical import path.
    
    Fixes #9767
