    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: set OFOR bBody.Pos to AST Pos
    
    Assign SSA OFOR's bBody.Pos to AST (*Node).Pos as it is created.
    
    An empty for loop has no other information which may be used to give
    correct position information in the resulting executable. Such a for
    loop may compile to a single `JMP *self` and it is important that the
    location of this is in the right place.
    
    Fixes #30167.
