    crypto/rsa: fix decryption benchmark.
    
    I was an idiot and was thinking that a small base didn't matter
    because the exponentiation would quickly make the number the same size
    as the modulus. But, of course, the small base continues to make
    multiplications unrealistically cheap throughout the computation.
