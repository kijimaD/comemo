    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: make minimization tests more reliable
    
    * Introduced -fuzzminimizetime flag to control the number of time or
      the number of calls to spend minimizing. Defaults to 60s. Only works
      for unrecoverable crashes for now.
    * Moved the count (used by -fuzztime=1000x) into shared
      memory. Calling workerClient.fuzz resets it, but it will remain
      after the worker processes crashes. workerClient.minimize resets it
      once before restarting the worker the first time, but the total
      number of runs should still be limited during minimization, even
      after multiple terminations and restarts.
    * Renamed fuzzArgs.Count to Limit to avoid confusion.
    * Several other small fixes and refactorings.
