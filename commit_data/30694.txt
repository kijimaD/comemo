    testing: comment out flag.Parse from example
    
    The TestMain docs explain that flag.Parse() should be called if TestMain
    itself depends on command-line flags.
    
    The issue here is that the example implementation does not use any
    flags, and thus the flag.Parse call is unnecessary. This leads to people
    who use this example as a starting point for their own implementations
    to forget that the call is not necessary in most cases.
    
    Comment it out instead of removing the line to keep it as a reminder, as
    suggested by Minux Ma.
