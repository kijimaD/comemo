    database/sql: scan into *time.Time without reflection
    
    Previously scanning time.Time into a *time.Time required reflection.
    Now it does not. Scanning already checked if the source value was of
    type time.Time. The only addition was checking the destination was
    of type *time.Time.
    
    Existing tests already scan time.Time into *time.Time, so no new
    tests were added. Linked issue has performance justification.
    
    Fixes #22300
