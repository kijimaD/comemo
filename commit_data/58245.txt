    cmd/compile: update to rules on PPC64 folding bit reversal to load
    
    In the Power10 rule to fold bit reversal into load, the MOVWZreg or
    MOVHZreg (Zeroing out the upper bits of a  word or halfword) becomes
    redundant since byte reverse (BR) load clears the upper bits. Hence
    removing for Power10. Similarly for < Power10  cases in the rule used to
    fold bit reversal into load (Bswap), the above redundant operation is removed.
