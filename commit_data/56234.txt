    cmd/dist: allow arbitrary package renames for bootstrap imports
    
    Import declaration matching currently has a list of specific cases. It
    allows bare imports, dot imports, and renamed imports named "exec" and
    "rtabi".
    
    Keeping a specific allowlist of renamed imports is unnecessary and
    causes annoyance for developers adding such imports, as the bootstrap
    build errors do not make it clear that this is where the issue lies.
    
    We can simplify this to be much more general. The body of the condition
    will still only rewrite imports in cmd/ or in bootstrapDirs.
    
    I believe the only downside of this change is that it makes it a bit
    more likely to match and replace within comments. That said, there
    should be no harm in replacements within comments.
    
    This change results in no change to the resulting bootstrap source tree:
