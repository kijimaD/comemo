    go/constant: document that Value.String and ExactString return quoted strings
    
    This has always been the case but it was not obvious from the documentation.
    The reason for the quoting is that String() may return an abbreviated string,
    starting with double-quote (") but ending in ... (w/o a quote). The missing
    quote indicates the abbreviation (in contrast to a string ending in ...").
    
    constant.StringVal can be used to obtain the unquoted string of a String Value.
