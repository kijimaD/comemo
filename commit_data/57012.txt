    net/http: don't write HEAD response body in ResponseWriter.ReadFrom
    
    Responses to HEAD requests don't have a body.
    
    The ResponseWriter automatically discards writes to the response body
    when responding to a HEAD request. ResponseWriter.ReadFrom was failing
    to discard writes under some circumstances; fix it to do so.
    
    Fixes #68609
