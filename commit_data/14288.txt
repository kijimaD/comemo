    cmd/gc: racewalk: fix a bunch of minor issues
    1. Prepend racefuncenter() to fn->enter -- fn->enter can contain new() calls,
    and we want them to be in the scope of the function.
    2. Dump fn->enter and fn->exit.
    3. Add TODO that OTYPESW expression can contain interesting memory accesses.
    4. Ignore only _ names instead of all names starting with _.
