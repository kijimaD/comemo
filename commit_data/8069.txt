    build: tidy intermediate files during build
    
    This CL changes the behavior of 'make install' and 'make test'
    in the src/cmd directory and the src/pkg directory to have
    each recursive make clean up after itself immediately.
    
    It does the same in test/run, removing $F.$A and $A.out
    (the common byproducts) between runs.
    
    On machines with slow disks and aggressive kernel caching,
    cleaning up immediately can mean that the intermediate
    objects never get written to disk.
    
    This change eliminates almost all the disk waiting during
    all.bash on my laptop (a Thinkpad X201s with an SSD running Linux).
