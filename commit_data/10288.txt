+This weekly snapshot includes some package changes.
+
+In preparation for the Go 1 package reorganziation the sources for various
+packages have been moved, but the import paths remain unchanged. This
+inconsistency breaks goinstall at this snapshot. If you use goinstall, please
+stay synced to the previous weekly snapshot until the next one is tagged.
+
+The Error methods in the html, bzip2, and sql packages that return error values
+have been renamed to Err.
+
+Some non-core parts of the http package have been moved to net/http/httputil.
+The Dump* and NewChunked* functions and ClientConn, ServerConn, and
+ReverseProxy types have been moved from http to httputil.
+
+The API for html/template is now a direct copy of the template API, instead of
+exposing a single Escape function. For HTML templates, simply use the
+html/template package as you would the template package.
+
+Other changes:
+* all: rename os.EOF to io.EOF in non-code contexts (thanks Vincent Vanackere),
+	sort imports with gofix.
+* archive/zip: close file opened with OpenReader (thanks Dmitry Chestnykh).

+	fix escaping of package paths in symbol names,

+	portably read archive headers (thanks Ron Minnich).
+* gob: fix bug when registering the same type multiple times.
+* gofix: avoid panic on body-less functions in netudpgroup,
+	make fix order implicit by date.
+* gofmt, gofix: sort imports.
+* goinstall: support launchpad.net/~user branches (thanks Jani Monoses).
+* gopack: do not look for Go metadata in non-Go objects.
