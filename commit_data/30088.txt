    path/filepath: make TestToNorm robust
    
    The old code leaves garbages in a temporary directory because it
    cannot remove the current working directory on windows.
    The new code changes the directory before calling os.Remove.
    
    Furthermore, the old code assumes that ioutil.TempDir (os.TempDir)
    doesn't return a relative path nor an UNC path.
    If it isn't the case, the new code calls t.Fatal earlier for preventing
    ambiguous errors.
    
    Finally, the old code reassigns the variable which is used by the defer
    function. It could cause unexpected results, so avoid that.
