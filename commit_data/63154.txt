    crypto/tls: have servers prefer TLS 1.3 when supported
    
    Previously the common Config.mutualVersion() code prioritized the
    selected version based on the provided peerVersions being sent in peer
    preference order.
    
    Instead we would prefer to see TLS 1.3 used whenever it is
    supported, even if the peer would prefer an older protocol version.
    This commit updates mutualVersions() to implement this policy change.
    
    Our new behaviour matches the behaviour of other TLS stacks, notably
    BoringSSL, and so also allows enabling the IgnoreClientVersionOrder BoGo
    test that we otherwise must skip.
    
    Updates #72006
