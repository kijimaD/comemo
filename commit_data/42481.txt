    doc/go1.15: document two noteworthy json changes
    
    I had a look at the changes between 1.14 and master, and these are the
    only two that seem relevant enough for the changelog.
    
    There was also CL 179337 to reuse values when decoding map elements, but
    it got reverted in CL 234559 and is not being included in 1.15.
    
    Updates #37419.
