    internal/trace: use MU slope to optimize MMU
    
    This commit speeds up MMU construction by ~10X (and reduces the number
    of windows considered by ~20X) by using an observation about the
    maximum slope of the windowed mutator utilization function to advance
    the window time in jumps if the window's current mean mutator
    utilization is much larger than the current minimum.
