    cmd/nm: reimplement in Go
    
    The immediate goal is to support the new object file format,
    which libmach (nm's support library) does not understand.
    Rather than add code to libmach or reengineer liblink to
    support this new use, just write it in Go.
    
    The C version of nm reads the Plan 9 symbol table stored in
    Go binaries, now otherwise unused.
    
    This reimplementation uses the standard symbol table for
    the corresponding file format instead, bringing us one step
    closer to removing the Plan 9 symbol table from Go binaries.
    
    Tell cmd/dist not to build cmd/nm anymore.
    Tell cmd/go to install cmd/nm in the tool directory.
