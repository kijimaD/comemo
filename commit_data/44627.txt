    cmd/go: include default GOEXPERIMENT in build config
    
    Currently, the build config includes GOEXPERIMENT environment
    variable if it is not empty, but that doesn't take the default
    value (set at make.bash/bat/rc time) into consideration. This
    may cause standard library packages appearing stale, as the
    build config appears changed.
    
    This CL changes it to use cfg.GOEXPERIMENT variable, which
    includes the default value (if it is not overwritten).
    
    May fix regabi and staticlockranking builders.
