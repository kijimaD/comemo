    runtime: make netpollBreak entries identifiable on Windows
    
    It is currently not possible to distinguish between a netpollBreak
    entry and an entry initiated by external WSA operations (as in #58870).
    
    This CL sets a unique completion key when posting the
    netpollBreak entry so that it can be identified as such.
