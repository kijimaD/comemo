    cmd/dist: skip spectralnorm shootout test on the linux-arm-arm5 builder
    
    Temporary fix to get the arm5 builder happy again.
    
    Without hardware floating point, this test takes over 20 minutes to
    run.
    
    A proper solution would probably be to run all the benchmark tests,
    but with a much lower iteration count, just to exercise the code.
    
    Updates golang/go#12688
