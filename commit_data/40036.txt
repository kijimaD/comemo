    cmd/go/internal/robustio: extend filesystem workarounds to darwin platforms
    
    The macOS filesystem seems to have gotten significantly flakier as of
    macOS 10.14, so this causes frequently flakes in the 10.14 builders.
    
    We have no reason to believe that it will be fixed any time soon, so
    rather than trying to detect the specific macOS version, we'll apply
    the same workarounds that we use on Windows: classifying (and
    retrying) the errors known to indicate flakiness and relaxing the
    success criteria for renameio.TestConcurrentReadsAndWrites.
    
    Fixes #33041
