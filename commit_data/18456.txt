    cmd/6g, cmd/8g, cmd/5g: make the undefined instruction have no successors
    
    The UNDEF instruction was listed in the instruction data as having the next instruction in the stream as its successor. This confused the optimizer into adding a load where it wasn't needed, in turn confusing the liveness analysis pass for GC bitmaps into thinking that the variable was live.
    
    Fixes #7229.
