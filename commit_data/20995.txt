    gc: abort if given an unknown debug (-d) flag
    
    The check for unknown command line debug flags in gc was
    incorrect: the loop over debugtab terminates when it reaches a
    nil entry, but it was only reporting an error if the parser
    had passed the last entry of debugtab (which it never did).
    Fix this by reporting the usage error if the loop reaches a
    nil entry.
