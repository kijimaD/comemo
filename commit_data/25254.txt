    net/http: enable automatic HTTP/2 if TLSNextProto is nil
    
    This enables HTTP/2 by default (for https only) if the user didn't
    configure anything in their NPN/ALPN map. If they're using SPDY or an
    alternate http2 or a newer http2 from x/net/http2, we do nothing
    and don't use the standard library's vendored copy of x/net/http2.
    
    Upstream remains golang.org/x/net/http2.
    
    Update #6891
