commit 6abfdc3fdd49d7691e1cdc3028849fa40e4a41f2

    image/gif: check that individual frame's bounds are within the overall
    GIF's bounds.
    
    Also change the implicit Config Width and Height to be the
    Rectangle.Max, not the Dx and Dy, of the first frame's bounds. For the
    case where the first frame's bounds is something like (5,5)-(8,8), the
    overall width should be 8, not 3.
