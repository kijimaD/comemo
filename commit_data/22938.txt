    html/template: fix pipeline sanitization
    
    Pipelines are altered by inserting sanitizers if they are not
    already present. The code makes the assumption that the first
    operands of each commands are function identifiers.
    
    This is wrong, since they can also be methods. It results in
    a panic with templates such as {{1|print 2|.f 3}}
    
    Adds an extra type assertion to make sure only identifiers
    are compared with sanitizers.
    
    Fixes #10673
