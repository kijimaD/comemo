    cmd/compile: improve PPC64.rules to reduce size of rewritePPC64.go
    
    Some rules in PPC64.rules cause an extremely large rewritePPC64.go
    file to be generated, due to rules with commutative operations and
    many operands. This happens with the existing
    rules for combining byte loads in little endian order, and
    also happens with the pending change to do the same for bytes
    in big endian order.
    
    The change improves the existing rules and reduces the size of
    the rewrite file by more than 60%. Once this change is merged,
    then the pending change for big endian ordered rules will be
    updated to use rules that avoid generating an excessively large
    rewrite file.
    
    This also includes a fix to a performance regression for
    littleEndian.PutUint16 on ppc64le.
