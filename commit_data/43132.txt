    cmd/go: fix doc math for build cache hashing
    
    The function takes five 24-bit chunks from the hash, resulting in 120
    bits. When base-64 encoded, this results in a 20-byte output string,
    which is confirmed by "var dst [chunks * 4]byte".
    
    It seems like the documented math could have been written for a previous
    implementation with shorter hashes, using 4 chunks instead of 5, as then
    the math checks out.
    
    Since this code has been working correctly for over three years, let's
    fix the documentation to reflect the code.
