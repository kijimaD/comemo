    fmt: document and adjust Scanf space handling to eliminate a few paradoxes
    
    This CL makes minor adjustment to the handling of spaces and newlines
    and then documents the result.
    
    The semantic adjustment mainly concerns the handling of a run of
    spaces following a newline in the format, like in "\n ".
    Previously, that run of spaces was ignored entirely, leading to paradoxes
    like the format "1 \n 2" not matching itself as input.
    Now, spaces following a newline in the format match zero or more
    spaces following the corresponding newline in the input.
    
    The changes to the test suite show how minor the semantic adjustments are
    and how they make the behavior more regular than previously.
    
    This CL also updates the documentation to explain the handling of
    spaces more precisely, incorporating the draft from CL 17723 but
    describing the newly introduced behavior.
    
    Fixes #13565.
