    runtime: fix released bytes accumulation in bg scavenger
    
    Currently "released" is not accumulated bytes released. If the last
    attempt to scavenge ends up as 0, then the scavenger will go to sleep
    too soon. This is an artifact from the old code where scavenge would
    only be called into once.
