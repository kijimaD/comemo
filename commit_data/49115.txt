    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: fix two bugs in BenchmarkWorkerFuzzOverhead
    
    * The exec count must be set to 0 before calling
      workerServer.fuzz. This was causing fuzz to run indefinitely after
      the first benchmark iteration, since it wouldn't hit the termination
      condition of being equal to fuzzArgs.Limit.
    * Added an assertion that the count must be lower than fuzzArgs.Limit
      at the beginning of workerServer.fuzz.
    * Also closed and deleted shared memory at the end of each benchmark run.
