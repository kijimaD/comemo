    doc/go1.19: prefer relative links to other parts of the Go website
    
    The Go website can be served on more than one domain (for example,
    go.dev, golang.google.cn, tip.golang.org, localhost:6060, and so on).
    Use relative links which work in all contexts.
    
    For #51400.
    Updates #53337.
