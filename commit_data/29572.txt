    runtime: handle bad ftab index in symtab.go
    
    If a program has had its text section split into multiple
    sections then the ftab that is built is based on addresses
    prior to splitting.  That means all the function addresses
    are there and correct because of relocation but the
    but the computed idx won't always match up quite right and
    in some cases go beyond the end of the table, causing a panic.
    
    To resolve this, determine if the idx is too large and if it is,
    set it to the last index in ftab.  Then search backward to find the
    matching function address.
    
    Fixes #17854
