    cmd/ld: support for relocation variants
    
    Most ppc64 relocations come in six or more variants where the basic
    relocation formula is the same, but which bits of the computed value
    are installed where changes.  Introduce the concept of "variants" for
    internal relocations to support this.  Since this applies to
    architecture-independent relocation types like R_PCREL, we do this in
    relocsym.
    
    Currently there is only an identity variant.  A later CL that adds
    support for ppc64 ELF relocations will introduce more.
