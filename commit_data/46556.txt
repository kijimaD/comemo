    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: calculate variable sizes in walk
    
    Walk already explicitly calculates the size of all expression types,
    to make sure they're known before SSA generation (which is concurrent,
    and thus not safe to modify shared state like types). Might as well
    compute all local variable sizes too, to be consistent.
    
    Reduces the burden of the frontend to make sure it's calculated the
    size of types that only the backend cares about.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
