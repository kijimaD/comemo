    liblink: fix arm build again
    
    Another attempt to fix the arm build by moving the include of signal.h
    to cmd/lex.c, unless we are building on plan9.
    
    Obviously if we had a plan9/arm builder this would probably not work, but
    this is only a temporary measure until the c2go transition is complete.
