    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: simplify how irgen handles qualified idents
    
    This CL moves qualified identifier handling into expr0 with other
    selector expressions, rather than as a completely separate special
    case handled up front. This has a few benefits:
    
    1. It's marginally simpler/cleaner.
    
    2. It allows extra checking for imported objects that they have the
    same type that types2 thought they had.
    
    3. For imported, untyped constants, we now instead handle them with
    the "tv.Value != nil" case. In particular, this ensures that they've
    always already been coerced to the appropriate concrete type by
    types2.
