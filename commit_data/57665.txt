    cmd/internal/objabi: generalize "is runtime package" check
    
    There are several implementations of "is this package path a runtime
    package". They all have slightly different lists because they all care
    about slightly different properties of building the runtime.
    
    To start converging these, we replace objabi.IsRuntimePackagePath with
    objabi.LookupPkgSpecial, which returns a struct we can extend with
    various special build properties. We'll extend this with several other
    flags in the following CLs.
