    ld: fix Plan 9 symbol table
    
    Static symbols were not being marked as such.
    
    I also made the 'z' symbols use the first byte of
    the name instead of an explicit NUL so that if
    the symbol table format is ever changed, the only
    place that would need updating is addhist().
