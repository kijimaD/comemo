commit 71f061043df89b1c1150b4ed2bf2d70a78b2af0d
Author: Keith Randall <khr@golang.org>
Date:   Fri May 31 20:43:33 2013 -0700

    runtime/gc: Run garbage collector on g0 stack
    instead of regular g stack. We do this so that the g stack
    we're currently running on is no longer changing.  Cuts
    the root set down a bit (g0 stacks are not scanned, and
    we don't need to scan gc's internal state).  Also an
    enabler for copyable stacks.
