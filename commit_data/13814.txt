    cmd/pack: rename __.SYMDEF to __.GOSYMDEF
    
    This fixes a problem with ELF tools thinking they know the
    format of the symbol table, as we do not use any of the
    standard formats for that table.
    
    This change will probably annoy the Plan 9 users, but I
    believe there are other incompatibilities already that mean
    they have to use a Go-specific nm.
    
    Fixes #3473.
