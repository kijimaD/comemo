    text/template: exec should accept interface value as valid.
    
    Currently, if you pass some data to a template as an interface (e.g. interface{})
    and extract that value that value as a parameter for a function, it fails, saying
    wrong type.
    
    This is because it is only looking at the interface type, not the interface content.
    
    This CL uses the underlying content as the parameter to the func.
    
    Fixes #3642.
