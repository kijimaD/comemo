    time: optimize FixedZone by caching unnamed zones by the hour
    
    FixedZone is transitively called by Time.UnmarshalJSON or Time.UnmarshalText
    for any RFC 3339 timestamp that is not in UTC.
    This function is relatively slow since it allocates 3 times.
    
    Given that RFC 3339 never has a zone name and most offsets are by the hour,
    we can cache unnamed zones on hour offsets.
    Caching a Location should be safe since it has no exported fields or methods
    that can mutate the Location. It is functionally immutable.
    
    The only way to observe that the Location was cached is either
    by pointer comparison or by shallow copying the struct value.
    Neither operation seems sensible to do with a *time.Location.
    
    Performance:
    
            name           old time/op  new time/op  delta
            UnmarshalText  268ns ± 2%   182ns ± 1%  -32.01%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
