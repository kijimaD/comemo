    cmd/internal/obj/arm: support more ARM VFP instructions
    
    Add support of more ARM VFP instructions in the assembler.
    They were introduced in ARM VFPv4.
    
    "FMULAF/FMULAD   Fm, Fn, Fd": Fd = Fd + Fn*Fm
    "FNMULAF/FNMULAD Fm, Fn, Fd": Fd = -(Fd + Fn*Fm)
    "FMULSF/FMULSD   Fm, Fn, Fd": Fd = Fd - Fn*Fm
    "FNMULSF/FNMULSD Fm, Fn, Fd": Fd = -(Fd - Fn*Fm)
    
    The multiplication results are not rounded.
