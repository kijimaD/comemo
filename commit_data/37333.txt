    cmd/compile: simplify walk OCONVIFACE
    
    n.Type and n.Left.Type are used heavily. Give them useful names.
    
    We generate the type word frequently. Make it a closure.
    (We don't want to generate it up front, since there are some code
    paths that don't need it, and generating it has side-effects.)
    
    Simplify and document the final call construction.
    
    Follow-up to address feedback on CL 147360.
