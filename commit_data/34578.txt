    cmd/compile: fix failure to reset reused bit of storage
    
    This is the "3rd bug" that caused compilations to sometimes
    produce different results when dwarf location lists were
    enabled.
    
    A loop had not been properly rewritten in an earlier
    optimization CL, and it accessed uninitialized data,
    which was deterministically perhaps wrong when single
    threaded, but variably wrong when multithreaded.
