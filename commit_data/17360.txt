    net: remove redundant argument check from Dial on udp, unix networks
    
    The net package consists of thin three layers like the follwoing;
    
    - Exposed API, that contains net.Dial, net.DialUDP, net.DialUnix
    - Socket and network file descriptor, that contains net.netFD and
      its methods, helper functions such as dialUDP, dialUnix
    - Network pollster, that contains net.pollDesc and its methods
    
    This CL removes redundant argument check which is already done by
    API layer.
