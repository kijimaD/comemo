    cmd/6c, cmd/8c: add fixjmp step to regopt.
    
    The fixjmp step eliminates redundant chains of JMP
    instructions that are produced by the compiler during
    code generation.
    
    It is already implemented in gc, and can be adapted to 6c/8c with
    the exception that JMPs refer to destination by pc instead of by
    pointer. The algorithm is modified to operate on Regs instead of Progs
    for this reason. The pcs are already restored later by regopt.
