    cmd/go/internal/search: consolidate package-pattern predicates into Match methods
    
    This change consolidates predicates currently scattered throughout
    various parts of the package and module loader into methods on the
    search.Match type.
    
    That not only makes them more concise, but also encourages
    consistency, both in the code and in reasoning about the kinds of
    patterns that need to be handled. (For example, the IsLocal predicate
    was previously two different calls, either of which could be easily
    forgotten at a given call site.)
    
    Factored out from CL 185344 and CL 185345.
    
    Updates #32917
