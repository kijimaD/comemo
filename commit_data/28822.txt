    cmd/cover: handle gotos
    
    If a labeled statement is the target of a goto, we must treat it as the
    boundary of a new basic block, but only if it is not already the boundary
    of a basic block such as a labeled for loop.
    
    Fixes #16624
    
    Now reports 100% coverage for the test in the issue.
