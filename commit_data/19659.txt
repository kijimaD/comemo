    archive/tar: reuse temporary buffer in readHeader
    
    A temporary 512 bytes buffer is allocated for every call to
    readHeader. This buffer isn't returned to the caller and it could
    be reused to lower the number of memory allocations.
    
    This CL improves it by using a pool and zeroing out the buffer before
    putting it back into the pool.

    This improvement is very important if your code has to deal with a lot
    of tarballs which contain a lot of files.
