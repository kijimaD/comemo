    internal/buildcfg: make regabi an alias for regabi sub-experiments
    
    Currently, specifying GOEXPERIMENT=regabi will turn on all regabi
    sub-experiments, but GOEXPERIMENT=noregabi won't turn anything off.
    Regabi also isn't a "real" experiment in the sense that nothing in the
    code base should depend on it as an experiment flag (it should depend
    on the appropriate sub-experiments).
    
    Hence, drop Regabi from goexperiment.Flags and make "regabi" in
    GOEXPERIMENT be a real alias for all of the sub-flags, so regabi will
    turn on all of the sub-flags and noregabi will turn off all of the
    sub-flags.
    
    This way, once we enable the sub-experiments in the baseline
    configuration, it will be easy to turn off with "noregabi".
    
    For #40724.
