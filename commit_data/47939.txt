    cmd/compile: unique LinkString for renamed, embedded fields
    
    Using type aliases, it's possible to create structs with embedded
    fields that have no corresponding type literal notation. However, we
    still need to generate a unique name for these types to use for linker
    symbols. This CL introduces a new "struct{ Name = Type }" syntax for
    use in LinkString formatting to represent these types.
    
    Reattempt at CL 372914, which was rolled back due to race-y
    LocalPkg.Lookup call that isn't safe for concurrency.
    
    Fixes #50190.
