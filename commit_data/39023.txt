    runtime: fix sysUsed for Windows
    
    sysUsed on Windows cares about the result from the VirtualAlloc syscall
    returning exactly the address that was passed to it. However,
    VirtualAlloc aligns the address its given to the kernel's allocation
    granularity, so the returned address may not be the same.
    
    Note that this wasn't an issue in the past because we only sysUsed
    regions owned by spans, and spans are always a multiple of 8K, which
    is a multiple of the allocation granularity on most Windows machines.
