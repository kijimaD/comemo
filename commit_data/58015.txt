    runtime: relax TestWindowsStackMemory from 100kB to 128kB
    
    We've been getting intermittent flakes in this test since 2023,
    all reporting values just barely over 100kB on windows-386.
    
    If we were happy with 100kB, we should be happy with 128kB,
    and it should fix the flakes.
    
    Fixes #58570.
