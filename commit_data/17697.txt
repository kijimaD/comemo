    html/template: update the Tree field after parsing new templates
    After text/template.Parse, all the templates may have changed, so
    we need to set them all back to their unescaped state. The code
    did this but (mea culpa) forgot to set the Tree field of the html/template
    struct.
    
    Since the Tree is reset during escaping, this only matters if an error
    arises during escaping and we want to print a message.
    
    Fixes #6459.
