    cmd/link: avoid use of -T when linking with lld
    
    When doing external linking on Windows, auto-detect the linker flavor
    (bfd vs gold vs lld) and when linking with "lld", avoid the use of
    "-T" (linker script), since this option is not supported by lld.
    [Note: the Go linker currently employs -T to ensure proper placement
    of the .debug_gdb_scripts section, to work around issues in older
    versions of binutils; LLD recognizes this section and does place it
    properly].
    
    Updates #39326.
