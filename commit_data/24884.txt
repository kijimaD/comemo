    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: clean up nilcheck logic
    
    Be more clear about the two conditions that we care about:
    1) a block that performs a nil check (OpIsNonNil), which may be removed
    2) a block that is the non-nil sucessor for an OpIsNonNil block
    
    Now we only care about removing nilchecks for two scenarios:
    - a type 1 block is dominated by a type 2 block for the same value
    - a block is both type 1 and type 2 for the same value
    
    Fixes math/big.
