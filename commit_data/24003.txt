    fmt: don't unread eof scanning %x
    
    When scanning a hex byte at EOF, the code was ungetting the eof,
    which backed up the input and caused double-scanning of a byte.
    
    Delete the call to UnreadRune.
    
    This line appeared in 1.5 for some reason; it was not in 1.4 and
    should be removed again for 1.5
    
    Fixes #12090.
