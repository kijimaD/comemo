    runtime: on Plan 9, zero memory returned to the brk by sysFree
    
    Plan 9's sysFree has an optimization where if the object being freed
    is the last object allocated, it will roll back the brk to allow the
    memory to be reused by sysAlloc.  However, it does not zero this
    "returned" memory, so as a result, sysAlloc can return non-zeroed
    memory after a sysFree.  This leads to corruption because the runtime
    assumes sysAlloc returns zeroed memory.
    
    Fix this by zeroing the memory returned by sysFree.
    
    Fixes #9846.
