    cmd/cgo: prevent redeclaration of _Ctype_void when C.void is used
    
    CL 230037 changed cmd/cgo to emit "type _Ctype_foo = bar" aliases for
    all C.foo types mentioned in the original Go source files. However,
    cmd/cgo already emits an appropriate type definition for _Ctype_void.
    So if a source file explicitly mentions C.void, this resulted in
    _Ctype_void being declared multiple times.
    
    This CL fixes the issue by suppressing the "type _Ctype_void =
    _Ctype_void" alias before printing it. This should be safe because
    _Ctype_void is the only type that's specially emitted in out.go at the
    moment.
    
    A somewhat better fix might be to fix how _Ctype_void is declared in
    the cmd/cgo "frontend", but this is a less invasive fix.
    
    Fixes #39877.
