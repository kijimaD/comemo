    cmd/go: add telemetry counters for flag names and subcommand
    
    For #58894,#65586
    
    This is a revert of CL 560655 which was a revert of CL 559519.
    CL 559519 was reverted because it was broken on windows/386. But now
    CL 562715 pulls in x/telemetry CL 560462 which disables telemetry on
    windows/386, fixing that issue.
