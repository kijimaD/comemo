    crypto/rand: simplify Prime to use only rejection sampling
    
    The old code picks a random number n and then tests n, n+2, n+4, up to
    n+(1<<20) for primality before giving up and picking a new n.
    (The chance of finishing the loop and picking a new n is infinitesimally
    small.) This approach, called “incremental search” in the Handbook of
    Applied Cryptography, section 4.51, demands fewer bits from the random
    source and amortizes some of the cost of the small-prime division
    checks across the incremented values.
    
    This commit deletes the n+2, n+4, ... checks, instead picking a series
    of random n and stopping at the first one that is probably prime.
    This approach is called “rejection sampling.”
    
    Reasons to make this change, in decreasing order of importance:
    
    1. Rejection sampling is simpler, and simpler is more clearly correct.
    
    2. The main benefit of incremental search was performance, and that is
       less important than before. Incremental search required fewer random
       bits and was able to amortize the checks for small primes across the
       entire sequence. However, both random bit generation and primality
       checks have gotten faster much quicker than typical primes have
       gotten longer, so the benefits are not as important today.
       Also, random prime generation is not typically on the critical path.
    
       Negating any lingering concerns about performance, rejection sampling
       no slower in practice than the incremental search, perhaps because
       the incremental search was using a somewhat inefficient test to
       eliminate multiples of small primes; ProbablyPrime does it better.
    
       name              old time/op  new time/op  delta
       Prime/MathRand    69.3ms ±23%  68.0ms ±37%   ~     (p=0.531 n=20+19)
       Prime/CryptoRand  69.2ms ±27%  63.8ms ±36%   ~     (p=0.076 n=20+20)
    
       (Here, Prime/MathRand is the current Prime benchmark,
       and Prime/CryptoRand is an adaptation to use crypto/rand.Reader
       instead of math/rand's non-cryptographic randomness source,
       just in case the quality of the bits affects the outcome.
       If anything, rejection sampling is even better with cryptographically
       random bits, but really the two are statistically indistinguishable
       over 20 runs.)
    
    3. Incremental search has a clear bias when generating small primes:
       a prime is more likely to be returned the larger the gap between
       it and the next smaller prime. Although the bias is negligible in
       practice for cryptographically large primes, people can measure the
       bias for smaller prime sizes, and we have received such reports
       extrapolating the bias to larger sizes and claiming a security bug
       (which, to be clear, does not exist).
    
       However, given that rejection sampling is simpler, more clearly
       correct and at least no slower than incremental search, the bias
       is indefensible.
    
    4. Incremental search has a timing leak. If you can tell the incremental
       search ran 10 times, then you know that p is such that there are no
       primes in the range [p-20, p). To be clear, there are other timing
       leaks in our current primality testing, so there's no definitive
       benefit to eliminating this one, but there's also no reason to keep
       it around.
    
       (See https://bugs.chromium.org/p/boringssl/issues/detail?id=238 for
       all the work that would be needed to make RSA key generation
       constant-time, which is definitely not something we have planned for
       Go crypto.)
    
    5. Rejection sampling moves from matching OpenSSL to matching BoringSSL.
       As a general rule BoringSSL is the better role model.
       (Everyone started out using incremental search; BoringSSL switched
       to rejection sampling in 2019, as part of the constant-time work
       linked above.)
