    cmd/link: don't create go.info symbols for non-Go functions
    
    In writelines the linker uses various auxiliary information about a
    function to create its line table entries. (It also does some unrelated
    stuff, but never mind.) There's no reason to do this for non-Go
    functions, so it bails out if the symbol has no FuncInfo.
    
    However, it does so *after* it looks up (and implicitly creates!) the
    go.info symbol for the function, which doesn't make sense and risks
    creating duplicate symbols for static C functions. Move the check up so
    that it doesn't do that.
    
    Since non-Go functions can't reference Go types, there shouldn't be any
    relocations to type info DIEs that need to be built, so there should be
    no harm not doing that.
    
    I wanted to change the Lookup to an ROLookup but that broke the
    shared-mode tests with an inscrutable error.
    
    No test. It seems too specific to worry about, but if someone disagrees
    I can figure something out.
    
    Fixes #21566
