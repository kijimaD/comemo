    runtime: consolidate "out of GC work" checks
    
    We already have gcMarkWorkAvailable, but the check for GC mark work is
    open-coded in several places. Generalize gcMarkWorkAvailable slightly
    and replace these open-coded checks with calls to gcMarkWorkAvailable.
    
    In addition to cleaning up the code, this puts us in a better position
    to make this check slightly more complicated.
