commit 6cd74b03f38de40d84d1d9efe8663714ccfaaee5
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>

    Don't use a named pointer type as a receiver type.  The
    current spec forbids it:
        The type specified by the type name is called ``receiver
        base type''.  The receiver base type must be a type
        declared in the current file, and it must not be a pointer
        type.
