    cmd/compile: add IsStmt breakpoint info to src.lico
    
    Add IsStmt information to src.lico so that suitable lines
    for breakpoints (or not) can be noted, eventually for
    communication to the debugger via the linker and DWARF.
    
    The expectation is that the front end will apply statement
    boundary marks because it has best information about the
    input, and the optimizer will attempt to preserve these.
    The exact method for placing these marks is still TBD;
    ideally stopping "at" line N in unoptimized code will occur
    at a point where none of the side effects of N have occurred
    and all of the inputs for line N can still be observed.
    The optimizer will work with the same markings supplied
    for unoptimized code.
    
    It is a goal that non-optimizing compilation should conserve
    statement marks.
    
    The optimizer will also use the not-a-statement annotation
    to indicate instructions that have a line number (for
    profiling purposes) but should not be the target of
    debugger step, next, or breakpoints.  Because instructions
    marked as statements are sometimes removed, a third value
    indicating that a position (instruction) can serve as a
    statement if the optimizer removes the current instruction
    marked as a statement for the same line.  The optimizer
    should attempt to conserve statement marks, but it is not
    a bug if some are lost.
    
    Includes changes to html output for GOSSAFUNC to indicate
    not-default is-a-statement with bold and not-a-statement
    with strikethrough.
