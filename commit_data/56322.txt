    cmd/link: write buildid to plugin
    
    Currently, in plugin build mode we don't write the build ID. This
    is disabled in CL 29394 since plugin is supported on Darwin. Maybe
    it caused some problem with the Darwin dynamic linker. But it
    seems no problem currently. Enabled it.
    
    Fixes #59845.
