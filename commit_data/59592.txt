    net/http: correct doc for ServeFileFS
    
    The documentation of ServeFileFS was partly copied from ServeFile
    in CL 513956, however it's not exact. This CL fixes some typos, also
    removes obsolete comment for name param.
    
    For consistency, also adds godoc link for ServeFile and ServeContent.
    
    Fixes #66578
