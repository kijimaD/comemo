    runtime: use 64 bit calculation in overLoadFactor
    
    overLoadFactor used a uintptr for its calculations.
    When the number of potential buckets was large,
    perhaps due to a coding error or corrupt/malicious user input
    leading to a very large map size hint,
    this led to overflow on 32 bit systems.
    This overflow resulted in an infinite loop.
    
    Prevent it by always using a 64 bit calculation.
