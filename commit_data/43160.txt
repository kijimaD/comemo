    cmd/go: check for 'svn' binary in PATH in TestAccidentalGitCheckout
    
    This test requires subversion to run, but does not check to see if it's
    available before running as it does for git.
    
    Call testenv.MustHaveExecPath to check beforehand to allow the test to
    be skipped if the svn binary does not exist.
