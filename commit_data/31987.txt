    encoding/base32: make NoPadding Encoding's DecodedLen return exact size
    
    CL 47341 added support for decoding non-padded messages. But DecodedLen
    still returned a multiple of 5 for messages without a padding, even
    though it is possible to calculate the len exactly when using NoPadding.
    
    This change makes DecodedLen return the exact number of bytes that
    will be written. A change to the decoding logic is also made so that it
    can handle this case.
    
    DecodedLen now has the same behaviour as DecodedLen in encoding/base64.
    
    Fixes #20854
