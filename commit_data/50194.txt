    misc/wasm, cmd/link: do not let command line args overwrite global data
    
    On Wasm, wasm_exec.js puts command line arguments at the beginning
    of the linear memory (following the "zero page"). Currently there
    is no limit for this, and a very long command line can overwrite
    the program's data section. Prevent this by limiting the command
    line to 4096 bytes, and in the linker ensuring the data section
    starts at a high enough address (8192).
    
    (Arguably our address assignment on Wasm is a bit confusing. This
    is the minimum fix I can come up with.)
    
    Thanks to Ben Lubar for reporting this issue.
    
    Fixes #48797
    Fixes CVE-2021-38297
