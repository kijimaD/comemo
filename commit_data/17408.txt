    sync: improve once.Do documentation readability
    
    The previous wording, though accurate, was hard to parse.
    In particular, it was tempting to interpret "the method"
    as referring to "the function f" instead of "Do", and
    required effort to find the correct antecedent for
    "this receiver".
