    runtime: use OnesCount64 to count allocated objects in a span
    
    This change modifies the implementation of (*mspan).countAlloc by
    using OnesCount64 (which on many systems is intrinsified). It does so by
    using an unsafe pointer cast, but in this case we don't care about
    endianness because we're just counting bits set.
    
    This change means we no longer need the popcnt table which was redundant
    in the runtime anyway. We can also simplify the logic here significantly
    by observing that mark bits allocations are always 8-byte aligned, so we
    don't need to handle any edge-cases due to the fact that OnesCount64
    operates on 64 bits at a time: all irrelevant bits will be zero.
    
    Overall, this implementation is significantly faster than the old one on
    amd64, and should be similarly faster (or better!) on other systems
    which support the intrinsic. On systems which do not, it should be
    roughly the same performance because OnesCount64 is implemented using a
    table in the general case.
    
    Results on linux/amd64:
    
    name                         old time/op  new time/op  delta
    MSpanCountAlloc/bits=64-4    16.8ns ± 0%  12.7ns ± 0%  -24.40%  (p=0.000 n=5+4)
    MSpanCountAlloc/bits=128-4   23.5ns ± 0%  12.8ns ± 0%  -45.70%  (p=0.000 n=4+5)
