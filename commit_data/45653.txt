    cmd/compile: don't emit inltree for closure within body of inlined func
    
    When inlining functions with closures, ensure that we don't mark the
    body of the closure with a src.Pos marker that reflects the inline,
    since this will result in the generation of an inltree table for the
    closure itself (as opposed to the routine that the func-with-closure
    was inlined into).
    
    Fixes #46234.
