    doc/go1.14: remove TODO about Illumos port
    
    There is an active builder that was added in CL 201597,
    and it is passing on Go tip and release-branch.go1.13
    (with one failure that appears to be flaky due to being
    out of memory). It's also passing on all golang.org/x repos
    on tip and release-branch.go1.13. It's not configured to
    run on Go 1.12 release branches.
