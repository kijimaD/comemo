    Revert "Revert "cmd/compile: inline convI2E""
    
    This reverts commit 7dd9c385f6896c7dcb5d76353e52e36c81af2838.
    
    Reason for revert: Reverting the revert, which will re-enable the convI2E optimization.  We originally reverted the convI2E optimization because it was making the builder fail, but the underlying cause was later determined to be unrelated.
