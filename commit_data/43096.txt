    cmd/compile: use only bit patterns in isNonNegative
    
    CL 212777 added a check to isNonNegative
    to return true for unsigned values.
    However, the SSA backend isn't type safe
    enough for that to be sound.
    The other checks in isNonNegative
    look only at the pattern of bits.
    Remove the type-based check.
    
    Updates #37753
