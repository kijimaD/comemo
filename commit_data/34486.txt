    runtime: allow write barriers in gchelper
    
    We're about to start tracking nowritebarrierrec through systemstack
    calls, which detects that we're calling markroot (which has write
    barriers) from gchelper, which is called from the scheduler during STW
    apparently without a P.
    
    But it turns out that func helpgc, which wakes up blocked Ms to run
    gchelper, installs a P for gchelper to use. This means there *is* a P
    when gchelper runs, so it is allowed to have write barriers. Tell the
    compiler this by marking gchelper go:yeswritebarrierrec. Also,
    document the call to gchelper so I don't have to spend another half a
    day puzzling over how on earth this could possibly work before
    discovering the spooky action-at-a-distance in helpgc.
    
    Updates #22384.
    For #22460.
