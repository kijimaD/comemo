    net/http: accept HEAD requests with a body
    
    RFC 7231 permits HEAD requests to contain a body, although it does
    state there are no defined semantics for payloads of HEAD requests
    and that some servers may reject HEAD requests with a payload.
    
    Accept HEAD requests with a body.
    
    Fix a bug where a HEAD request with a chunked body would interpret
    the body as the headers for the next request on the connection.
    
    For #53960.
