    cmd/go: fix errors for commands run outside of modules
    
    Since CL 148517, several commands (including list and get) work when
    GO111MODULE=on even when no go.mod file is present. This broke an
    assumption made by "fix" and "generate" which caused panics when run
    with a list of .go files (whether or not the command was run inside a
    module).
    
    This change fixes those assumptions and adds test cases for other
    commands run outside modules.
    
    Fixes #29097
