    reflect: fix ArenaNew to match documentation
    
    Currently ArenaNew expects the type passed in to be a *T and it returns
    a *T. This does not match the function's documentation.
    
    Since this is an experiment, change ArenaNew to match the documentation.
    This more closely aligns ArenaNew with arena.New. (Takes a type T,
    returns a *T value.)
    
    Note that this is a breaking change. However, as far as pkg.go.dev can
    tell, there's exactly one package using it in the open source world.
    
    Also, add smoke test for the exported API, which is just a wrapper
    around the internal API. Clearly there's enough room for error here that
    it should be tested, but we don't need thorough tests at this layer
    because that already exists in the runtime. We just need to make sure it
    basically works.
    
    Fixes #60528.
