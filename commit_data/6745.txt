    path: Fix Glob when it finds a file in directory position.
    
    When searching a list of directories, the files which match
    the pattern are accumulated in a slice.  If the glob has a
    wildcard for the directory, and the wildcard matches a file
    rather than a directory, then the files found so far are
    discarded.  E.g., path.Glob("*/x") in a directory which
    contains both files and subdirectories.  This patch avoids
    discarding matches found so far when a file is found.
