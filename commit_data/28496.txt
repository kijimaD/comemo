    doc/go1.7.html: update documentation regarding compress/flate
    
    Document the following:
    * That the algorithmic changes are still compliant with RFC 1951. I remember
    people having questions regarding this issue, and it would be good to re-assure
    them that it is still standards compliant.
    * io.EOF can now be returned early (c27efce66bce7534dbb357ac1779bbc08395b267)
    * Use the term "decompress" when referred to as an action. The term "uncompressed"
    or "decompressed" are both valid as ways to represent the current state of the data.
