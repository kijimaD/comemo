    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: optimize constant pool
    
    "MOVD $0xaaaaaaaa, R2"
    "MOVD $-0x55555555, R3"
    
    For the above instructions, 64-bit constants 0x00000000 aaaaaaaa
    and 0xffffffff aaaaaaab are stored in the constant pool.
    
    This CL optimizes them to
    "MOVWU $0xaaaaaaaa, R2"
    "MOVW $-0x05555555, R3"
    and 32-bit constants 0xaaaaaaaa and 0xaaaaaaab are stored in the
    constant pool.
    
    There is a little size reduction (about total 5KB) in both the go
    executable and the library files.
