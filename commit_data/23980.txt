    spec: better organization of arithmetic operator section
    
    First step towards cleaning up the operator section - no language
    changes. Specifically:
    
    - Grouped arithmetic operations by types (integer, floating-point,
      string), with corresponding h4 headings.
    
    - Changed Operator precedence title from h3 to h4.
    
    - Moved Integer Overflow section after integer operations and changed
      its title from h3 to h4.
    
    This puts things that belong together closer. No heading id's were
    lost (in case of references from outside the spec).
