    net/http: export the "new" error codes from RFC 6585
    
    These were proposed in the RFC over three years ago, then proposed to
    be added to Go in https://codereview.appspot.com/7678043/ 2 years and
    7 months ago, and the spec hasn't been updated or retracted the whole
    time.
    
    Time to export them.
    
    Of note, HTTP/2 uses code 431 (Request Header Fields Too Large).
    
    Updates #12843
