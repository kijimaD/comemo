    debug/dwarf, encoding/asn1, go/ast: fix old comments
    
    The debug/dwarf and encoding/asn1 examples were added in 2009, a few
    months before Go added implicit semicolons, and never updated.
    
    The go/ast node types have always been named just "Expr", "Stmt", and
    "Decl", so the comments about "ExprNode", "StmtNode", and "DeclNode"
    were likely just mistaken because the interface tag methods are
    "exprNode", "stmtNode", and "declNode", respectively.
