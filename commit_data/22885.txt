    runtime: shared library runtime init for arm
    
    Adds the runtime initialization flow for arm akin to amd64.
    In particular,we use the library initialization entry point to:
        - create a new OS thread and run the "regular" runtime init stack on
          that thread
        - return immediately from the main (i.e., loader) thread
        - at the first CGO invocation, we wait for the runtime initialization
          to complete.
    
    Verified to work on a Raspberry Pi and an Android phone.
