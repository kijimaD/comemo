    8a: fixes for Plan 9 build
    
    8a/a.h:
    . Removed <u.h> and <libc.h> includes as they work better in "a.y".
    . Made definition of EOF conditional as it's defined in the Plan 9
      header files, but not elsewhere.
    
    8a/a.y:
    . Added <u.h> and <libc.h> because <stdio.h> in Plan 9 needs them.
      Sequence <u.h>, <stdio.h>, <libc.h> recommended by RSC.
    
    8a/lex.c:
    . Added <u.h> and <libc.h> as now needed by "a.h".
    . Dropped <ctype.h>.
    
    cc/lexbody:
    . exit() -> exits().
    . Dropped unwanted incrementation.
    
    cc/macbody:
    . Adjusted a few format specifications.
