    text/tabwriter: don't mimic previous lines on flush
    
    \f triggers a flush.
    
    This is used (by gofmt, among others) to indicate that
    the current aligned segment has ended.
    
    When flushed, it is unlikely that the previous line is
    in fact a good predictor of the upcoming line,
    so stop treating it as such.
    
    No performance impact on the existing benchmarks,
    which do not perform any flushes.
