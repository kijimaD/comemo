    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: don't export blank functions in unified IR
    
    After the previous two CLs, there's no need for unified IR to
    write/read blank functions anymore: types2 has already checked that
    they're valid, and the compiler backend is going to ignore them.
    
    Allows dropping code for worrying about blank methods and will
    probably simplify some of the object handling code eventually too.
    
    Fixes #47446.
