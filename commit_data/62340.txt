    cmd/internal/objabi: add new R_DWTXTADDR_* relocation types
    
    Add a set of new relocations to be used when the compiler is writing
    debug information using DWARF version 5. No changes in compiler or
    linker functionality, this patch just adds the relocations themselves
    and some helper functions; uses will appear in a later patch. These
    relocations are generated by the compiler when writing a DWARF DIE
    attribute of form DW_FORM_addrx, or when writing a .debug_addr index
    reference in a SDWARFRANGE or SDWARFLOC section. The target symbol of
    the relocation is a function (STEXT symbol); the linker resolves the
    relocation by replacing the target of the reloc with an index of a
    slot in the .debug_addr section (.debug_addr is new with DWARF5).
    
    Updates #26379.
