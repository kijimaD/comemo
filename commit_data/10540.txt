    exp/ssh: Add Start(cmd string) and Signal(sig string) to Session. Rename Exec to Run.
    
    Exec() has been renamed to Run() in keeping with the os/exec API.
    
    Added func (*Session) Start(cmd string) which starts a remote process but unlike Run() doesn't wait for it to finish before returning.
    
    Run() has been refactored to use Start internally. Its really just a refactoring, no new code but some extra functionality was won.
    
    Also added func (*Session) Signal(sig signal) which sends a UNIX signal to a remote process. This is espcially useful in conjunction with Start() as the two allow you to start a remote process, monitor its stdout/stderr, and send it a TERM/HUP/etc signal when you want it to close.
