    cmd/go: remove inadvertent comment for vgo
    
    This change was introduced while adding the dark copy
    of golang.org/x/vgo in CL 118095.
    
    While the comment made sense in a separate vgo repo, when it is
    merged with the main repo, this should not remain.
    
    Found while running mkalldocs.sh in CL 119695.
