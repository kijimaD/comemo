    doc: improve clarity of map index examples
    
    The fourth example for map indexing states you have a map of type [K]V
    and attempts to read in a variable of type T.  Further, the example
    is meant to showcase the boolean return variable saying whether the
    map contained a key, but overrides to type T.  This will not compile.
