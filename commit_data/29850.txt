    Revert: "archive/zip: handle mtime in NTFS/UNIX/ExtendedTS extra fields"
    
    This change reverts the following CLs:
            CL/18274: handle mtime in NTFS/UNIX/ExtendedTS extra fields
            CL/30811: only use Extended Timestamp on non-zero MS-DOS timestamps
    
    We are reverting support for extended timestamps since the support was not
    not complete. CL/18274 added full support for reading extended timestamp fields
    and minimal support for writing them. CL/18274 is incomplete because it made
    no changes to the FileHeader struct, so timezone information was lost when
    reading and/or writing.
    
    While CL/18274 was a step in the right direction, we should provide full
    support for high precision timestamps in both the reader and writer.
    This will probably require that we add a new field of type time.Time.
    The complete fix is too involved to add in the time remaining for Go 1.8
    and will be completed in Go 1.9.
