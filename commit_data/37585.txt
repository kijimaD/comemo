    all: use internal/cpu feature variables directly
    
    Avoid using package specific variables when there is a one to one
    correspondance to cpu feature support exported by internal/cpu.
    
    This makes it clearer which cpu feature is referenced.
    Another advantage is that internal/cpu variables are padded to avoid
    false sharing and memory and cache usage is shared by multiple packages.
