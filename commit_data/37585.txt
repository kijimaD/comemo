    crypto/elliptic: utilize faster z14 multiply/square instructions (when available)
    
    In the s390x assembly implementation of NIST P-256 curve, utilize faster multiply/square
    instructions introduced in the z14. These new instructions are designed for crypto
    and are constant time. The algorithm is unchanged except for faster
    multiplication when run on a z14 or later. On z13, the original mutiplication
    (also constant time) is used.
    
    P-256 performance is critical in many applications, such as Blockchain.
