    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: change ssa compilation trigger
    
    We used to compile everything with SSA and then decide whether
    to use the result or not.  It was useful when we were working
    on coverage without much regard for correctness, but not so much now.
    
    Instead, let's decide what we're going to compile and go through
    the SSA compiler for only those functions.
    
    TODO: next CL: get rid of all the UnimplementedF stuff.
