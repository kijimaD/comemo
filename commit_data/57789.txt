    crypto/internal/fips: add SHA2,SHA3,HMAC ACVP tests
    
    Adds a new crypto/internal/fips test binary that operates as both a unit
    test fetching/driving the BoringSSL acvptool, and an acvptool module
    wraper when invoked by the unit test. Initial support for testing the
    SHA2 and SHA3 family of digests, and the HMAC family of MACs is
    included.
    
    Test vectors and expected answers are maintained in a separate repo,
    `github.com/cpu/go-acvp` and fetched through the module proxy as part of
    the test process.
    
    The BSSL acvptool "lowers" the NIST ACVP server JSON test vectors into
    a simpler stdin/stdout protocol that can be implemented by a module
    wrapper. The tool will fork our acvpwrapper binary, request the
    supported configuration, and then provide test cases over stdin,
    expecting results to be returned on stdout.
    
    See "Testing other FIPS modules" from the BoringSSL ACVP.md
    documentation for a more detailed description of the protocol used
    between the acvptool and module wrappers.
