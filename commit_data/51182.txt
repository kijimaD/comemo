    spec: fix conversion rules (match implementation)
    
    As written, the conversion P(x), where P and the type
    of x are type parameters with identical underlying types
    (i.e., identical constraints), is valid. However, unless
    the type of x and P are identical (which is covered with
    the assignability rule), such a conversion is not valid
    in general (consider the case where both type parameters
    are different type parameters with constraint "any").
    
    This change adjusts the rules to prohibit type parameters
    in this case. The same reasoning applies and the analogue
    change is made for pointer types.
    
    The type checker already implements these updated rules.
