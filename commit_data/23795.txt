    [dev.ssa] initial implementation of PAUTO|PHEAP variables
    
    Call to the runtime to generate escaping variables and use the returned
    address when accessing these variables.
    
    Fix a couple of errors on the way. The rule for CALLstatic was missed
    during the Aux refactor and OCONVNOP wasn't converted.
