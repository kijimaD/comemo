    cmd/compile: delete unused (*Node) SetInt, SetBigInt, Bool
    
    Introduced in CL 9263 (prepare to unexport gc.Mp*) and CL 9267
    (prepare Node.Val to be unexported), their only callers were in
    the old backend and all got deleted in CL 29168 (cmd/compile:
    delete lots of the legacy backend).
    
    Update #16357
