    net/http: fix "http2: no cached connection..." error with x/net/http2
    
    The net/http Transport was testing for a sentinel x/net/http2 error
    value with ==, which meant it was only testing the bundled version. If
    a user enabled http2 via golang.org/x/net/http2, the error value had a
    different name.
    
    This also updates the bundled x/net/http2 to git rev ab555f36 for:
    
        http2: add internal function isNoCachedConnError to test for ErrNoCachedConn
        https://golang.org/cl/87297
    
    Fixes #22091
