    cmd/go: remove code specific to Google Code
    
    Remove all special handling of Google Code, which has shut down.
    
    Commit 4ec2fd3e6ac4f869d39348bf48016687b731d910 suggested that maybe the
    shutdown warning should remain. However, it has been missing from Go 1.6
    already, and by Go 1.7 people will most likely have realised that Google
    Code has shut down.
    
    Updates #10193.
