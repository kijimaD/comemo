    time: add Time.ZoneBounds
    
    The method Location.lookup returns the "start" and "end" times bracketing seconds when that zone is in effect.
    
    This CL does these things:
    
    1. Exported the "start" and "end" times as time.Time form
    2. Keep the "Location" of the returned times be the same as underlying time
    
    Fixes #50062.
