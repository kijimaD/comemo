    runtime: remove GoSched/GoStart trace events around GC
    
    These were appropriate for STW GC, since it interrupted the allocating
    Goroutine, but don't apply to concurrent GC, which runs on its own
    Goroutine. Forced GC is still STW, but it makes sense to attribute the
    GC to the goroutine that called runtime.GC().
