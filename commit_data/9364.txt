    build: support versioning without hg
    
    CL 4873048 introduced the ability to build without hg and
    getting an "unknown" version.  While this approach works
    to avoid the hg dependency, it also means that every
    exported tree that is built without hg or .hg will have not
    only missing information, but will also be compatible to
    one another.  Considering that it is a common practice to
    remove the VCS data in distributions, I suggest we don't
    take this approach to avoid its consequences.
    
    This CL fixes the same problem in a different way: if a
    VERSION file at the top of the tree exists, use it at
    all times.  If it doesn't, fall back to using information
    from hg necessarily, and fail if that's not possible.  The
    error message when VERSION and hg are not available
    instructs users to handle it properly.
    
    The VERSION file can be generated with
    "src/version.bash -save" while hg is still around.
