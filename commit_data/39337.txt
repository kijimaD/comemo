    syscall: refer to Proc.Call documentation for LazyProc.Call on Windows
    
    The documentation comment was duplicated for each of these methods, and
    the LazyProc.Call documentation incorrectly mentioned that Call accepts
    only 15 arguments, but it actually accepts 18 now.
    
    To prevent further documentation drift, refer the reader to the
    documentation for Proc.Call instead of duplicating it for LazyProc.Call.
    
    In addition, note that LazyProc's Addr, Call, and Find methods each
    trigger a procedure lookup.
