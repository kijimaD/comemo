    archive/tar: ensure input fits in octal field
    
    The prior logic would over-write the NUL-terminator if the octal value
    was long enough. In order to prevent this, we add a fitsInOctal function
    that does the proper check.
    
    The relevant USTAR specification about NUL-terminator is:
    <<<
    Each numeric field is terminated by one or more <space> or NUL characters.
    >>>
