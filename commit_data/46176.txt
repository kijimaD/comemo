    cmd/compile: fix reference to generic type needed by crawler
    
    This problem happens when you create a new local type that uses an
    imported generic type (maybe just by instantiating it), and then that
    local type needed to be included as part of an export. In that case, the
    imported generic type is does not have a declaration in the local
    package, so it is not necessarily created in types1, so the
    crawler/export doesn't work.
    
    To fix this issue, we just need to add a call to g.obj() for the base
    generic type, to make sure that it will exist if needed later in the
    compilation or for the crawler during export.
    
    Fixes #47514
