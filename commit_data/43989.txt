    doc/go1.16: address some remaining high-level TODOs
    
    The tools section TODO can be removed since the tools section looks
    complete by now.
    
    All TODOs in the minor changes to the library section have been done,
    so the top-level TODO is resolved. Delete it.
    
    The currently highlighted entries under Core library section look
    good. It's worth reviewing this further based on feedback from Go
    1.16 pre-releases, so keep the TODO but make it non-user-visible
    to unblock Go 1.16 Beta 1.
    
    For #40700.
