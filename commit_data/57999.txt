    net/http: handle MethodNotAllowed
    
    If no pattern matches a request, but a pattern would have
    matched if the request had a different method, then
    serve a 405 (Method Not Allowed), and populate the
    "Allow" header with the methods that would have succeeded.
    
    Updates #61640.
