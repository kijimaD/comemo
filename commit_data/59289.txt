    os,internal/poll: support I/O on overlapped files not added to the poller
    
    This fixes the support for I/O on overlapped files that are not added to
    the poller. Note that CL 661795 already added support for that, but it
    really only worked for pipes, not for plain files.
    
    Additionally, this CL also makes this kind of I/O operations to not
    notify the external poller to avoid confusing it.
    
    Updates #15388.
