    runtime: fix time on windows/arm under WINE
    
    This code has clearly never run successfully,
    since one of the â€œtail calls" calls the wrong function,
    and both of them appear in functions with stack frames
    that are never going to be properly unwound.
    Probably there is no windows/arm under WINE at all.
    But might as well fix the code.
