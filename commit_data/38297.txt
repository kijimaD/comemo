    spec: clarify rules for receiver base types
    
    The spec currently provides a syntactic rule for receiver base types,
    and a strict reading of those rules prohibits the use of type aliases
    referring to pointer types as receiver types.
    
    This strict interpretation breaks an assumed rule for aliases, which
    is that a type literal can always be replaced by an alias denoting
    that literal.
    
    Furthermore, cmd/compile always accepted this new formulation of the
    receiver type rules and so this change will simply validate what has
    been implemented all along.
    
    Fixes #27995.
