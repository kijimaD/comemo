    exp/html: remove "INCOMPLETE" comment
    
    I think that the parser is complete enough to take that warning out.
    It passes the test suite.
    There may be incompatible API changes, but being in the exp directory
    is warning enough for that.

-INCOMPLETE.
 
 Tokenization is done by creating a Tokenizer for an io.Reader r. It is the
 caller's responsibility to ensure that r provides UTF-8 encoded HTML.
