 The 'go test' command takes both flags that apply to 'go test' itself
 and flags that apply to the resulting test binary.
 
-The test binary, called pkg.test, where pkg is the name of the
-directory containing the package sources, has its own flags:
+The following flags are recognized by the 'go test' command and
+control the execution of any test:
 
-	-test.v
-	    Verbose output: log all tests as they are run.
-
-	-test.run pattern
-	    Run only those tests and examples matching the regular
-	    expression.

-	-test.bench pattern
+	-bench regexp
 	    Run benchmarks matching the regular expression.

+
+	-blockprofile block.out
+	    Write a goroutine blocking profile to the specified file
+	    when all tests are complete.
+
+	-blockprofilerate n
+	    Control the detail provided in goroutine blocking profiles by setting
+	    runtime.BlockProfileRate to n.  See 'godoc runtime BlockProfileRate'.
+	    The profiler aims to sample, on average, one blocking event every
+	    n nanoseconds the program spends blocked.  By default,
+	    if -test.blockprofile is set without this flag, all blocking events
+	    are recorded, equivalent to -test.blockprofilerate=1.
+
+	-cpu 1,2,4
+	    Specify a list of GOMAXPROCS values for which the tests or
+	    benchmarks should be executed.  The default is the current value
