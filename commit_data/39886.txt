    cmd/go/internal/modload: add an Unwrap method on ImportMissingError
    
    Jay suggested this in CL 189780, and it seems semantically correct.
    
    As far as I can tell this has no impact one way or the other right
    now, but might prevent confusion (or at least give us more experience
    with error handling!) in future changes.
