    cmd/dist: omit DWARF in build release toolchain binaries
    
    The vast majority of users of Go toolchains have no need for
    binaries like the go command and compiler to include DWARF
    information, and the DWARF information is 34% of the size of
    the overall Go toolchain zip files (14% when the toolchain is
    unzipped on disk, because other parts get bigger).
    
    To save network and disk, disable DWARF in build release binaries.
    DWARF remains enabled when developing in the main branch
    (signaled by no VERSION file existing), for better debuggability
    when actually working on the compiler and go command.
    
    Note that removing DWARF does not break the backtraces shown
    when a binary panics, nor does it break other uses of stack traces
    from within a Go program, such as runtime.Callers.
    
    To build a release toolchain with DWARF included, people can use
    
            GO_LDFLAGS=-w=0 ./make.bash
