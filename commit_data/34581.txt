    go/build: fix ImportDir to report PkgTarget for directories in GOROOT/GOPATH
    
    This makes ImportDir("$GOROOT/src/math", 0)
    and Import("math", "", 0) equivalent. It was an
    oversight that they were not before.
    
    An upcoming change to the go command relies on
    the two returning the same results.
