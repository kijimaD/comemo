    io: clarify Copy docs regarding error handling
    
    "returns ... the first error" was misleading or at least confusing:
    in case a Read results in an error with non-zero bytes read, and the
    subsequent Write also results in an error, the error from Write is
    returned, which is the second one (in the temporal dimension).
    
    Fixes #9744
