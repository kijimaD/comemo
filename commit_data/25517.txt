    cmd/compile: apply -importmap to imports before checking for package unsafe
    
    There are fewer special cases this way: the import map applies
    to all import paths, not just the ones not spelled "unsafe".
    
    This is also consistent with what the code in cmd/go and go/build expects.
    They make no exception for "unsafe".
    
    For #13703.
