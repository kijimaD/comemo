    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: fix build for x86 architectures
    
    Mishandled the complex addressing mode in masks<>(SB)(CX*8)
    as a casualty of the ARM work. Fix by backing all the flows up to
    the state where registerIndirect is always called with the input
    sitting on the opening paren.
    
    With this, build passes for me with linux-arm, linux-386, and linux-amd64.
