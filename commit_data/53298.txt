    spec: re-order built-ins sections alphabetically (more or less)
    
    Put the sections for the various built-ins into alphabetical order
    based on the built-in name, while keeping built-ins that belong
    together together.
    
    The order is now (captialized letter determines order):
    
    - Append
    - Clear
    - Close
    - Complex, real, imag
    - Delete
    - Len, cap
    - Make
    - Min, max (to be inserted here)
    - New
    - Panic, recover
    - Print, println
    
    There are some white space adjustments but no changes to the prose
    of the moved sections.
