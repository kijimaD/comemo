    cmd/compile: add marker for skipping dowidth when tracing typecheck
    
    The root cause of #33658 is that fmt.Printf does have side effects when
    printing Type.
    
    typefmt for TINTER will call Type.Fields to get all embedded fields and
    methods. The thing is that type.Fields itself will call dowidth, which will
    expand the embedded interface, make it non-embedded anymore.
    
    To fix it, we add a marker while we are tracing, so dowidth can know and
    return immediately without doing anything.
    
    Fixes #33658
