    cmd: fix the order that s390x operands are printed in
    
    The assembler reordered the operands of some instructions to put the
    first operand into From3. Unfortunately this meant that when the
    instructions were printed the operands were in a different order than
    the assembler would expect as input. For example, 'MVC $8, (R1), (R2)'
    would be printed as 'MVC (R1), $8, (R2)'.
    
    Originally this was done to ensure that From contained the source
    memory operand. The current compiler no longer requires this and so
    this CL simply makes all instructions use the standard order for
    operands: From, Reg, From3 and finally To.
    
    Fixes #18295
