    testing/quick: align tests with reflect.Kind.
    
    This commit is largely cosmetic in the sense that it is the remnants
    of a change proposal I had prepared for testing/quick, until I
    discovered that 3e9ed27 already implemented the feature I was looking
    for: quick.Value() for reflect.Kind Array.  What you see is a merger
    and manual cleanup; the cosmetic cleanups are as follows:
    
    (1.) Keeping the TestCheckEqual and its associated input functions
    in the same order as type kinds defined in reflect.Kind.  Since
    3e9ed27 was committed, the test case began to diverge from the
    constant's ordering.
    
    (2.) The `Intptr` derivatives existed to exercise quick.Value with
    reflect.Kind's `Ptr` constant.  All `Intptr` (unrelated to `uintptr`)
    in the test have been migrated to ensure the parallelism of the
    listings and to convey that `Intptr` is not special.
    
    (3.) Correct a misspelling (transposition) of "alias", whereby it is
    named as "Alais".
