    runtime: combine gcWorkProducer into gcWork
    
    The distinction between gcWorkProducer and gcWork (producer and
    consumer) is not serving us as originally intended, so merge these
    into just gcWork.
    
    The original intent was to replace the currentwbuf cache with a
    gcWorkProducer. However, with gchelpwork (aka mutator assists),
    mutators can both produce and consume work, so it will make more sense
    to cache a whole gcWork.
