    cmd/go: make 'go list -test' report the correct import path
    
    When a test variant of a package is created, the two versions cannot
    share memory for the fields that contain information about their
    imports, as these will be different between the two packagse.
    
    Both the Internal.Imports and the Imports fields must be able to be
    updated in the test variant without affecting the values of the
    original.
    
    Fixes golang/go#26880
