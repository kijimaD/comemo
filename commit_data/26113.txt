+Packages in a program need not have unique package names,
+but there are two reserved package names with special meaning.
+The name main indicates a command, not a library.
+Commands are built into binaries and cannot be imported.
+The name documentation indicates documentation for
+a non-Go program in the directory. Files in package documentation
+are ignored by the go command.
+
 As a special case, if the package list is a list of .go files from a
 single directory, the command is applied to a single synthesized
 package made up of exactly those files, ignoring any build constraints
