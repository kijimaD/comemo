    cmd/go: fix spacing in help text of -overlay flag
    
    There was a space missing in the first line shown below, and an extra
    space in the second line shown. Thanks Peter Bourgon for noting this.
    
    BEFORE:
    $ go help build | grep -A1 'has some limitations'
    has some limitations:importantly, cgo files included from outside the
    include path must be  in the same directory as the Go package they are
    
    AFTER:
    $ go help build | grep -A1 'has some limitations'
    has some limitations: importantly, cgo files included from outside the
    include path must be in the same directory as the Go package they are
    
    Note that I edited alldocs.go by hand here, as the mkalldocs.sh script
    produces a lot more changes, for example adding the -insecure flag
    documentation in. Not sure what's wrong there.
