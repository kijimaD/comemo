    net/http: add request file upload benchmarks
    
    This adds benchmarks to test file uploads using PUT requests.
    
    It's designed to complement changes https://golang.org/cl/163599 and
    https://golang.org/cl/163737, allowing an easy comparison of
    performance before and after these changes are applied.
    
    Updates #30377.
