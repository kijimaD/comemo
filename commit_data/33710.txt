    doc: minor clarification regarding the sharing of underlying arrays
    
    The last sentence in the section on slice expressions could be read
    as if it might apply to strings. Changed the sentence a bit to
    emphasize its applicability to slices only. See also the issue for
    more background.
    
    Fixes #19220.
