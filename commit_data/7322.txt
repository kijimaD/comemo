+
+<pre>
+This release includes significant changes to channel operations and minor
+changes to the log package. Your code will require modification if it uses
+channels in non-blocking communications or the log package's Exit functions.
+
+Non-blocking channel operations have been removed from the language.
+The equivalent operations have always been possible using a select statement
+with a default clause.  If a default clause is present in a select, that clause
+will execute (only) if no other is ready, which allows one to avoid blocking on
+a communication.
+
+For example, the old non-blocking send operation,
+
+	if ch <- v {
+		// sent
+	} else {
+		// not sent
+	}
+
+should be rewritten as,
+
+	select {
+	case ch <- v:
+		// sent
+	default:
+		// not sent
+	}
+
+Similarly, this receive,
+
+	v, ok := <-ch
+	if ok {
+		// received
+	} else {
+		// not received
+	}
+
+should be rewritten as,
+
+	select {
+	case v := <-ch:
+		// received
+	default:
+		// not received
+	}
+
+This change is a prelude to redefining the 'comma-ok' syntax for a receive.
+In a later release, a receive expression will return the received value and an
+optional boolean indicating whether the channel has been closed. These changes
+are being made in two stages to prevent this semantic change from silently
+breaking code that uses 'comma-ok' with receives.
+There are no plans to have a boolean expression form for sends.
+
+Sends to a closed channel will panic immediately. Previously, an unspecified
+number of sends would fail silently before causing a panic.
+
+The log package's Exit, Exitf, and Exitln functions have been renamed Fatal,
+Fatalf, and Fatalln respectively. This brings them in line with the naming of
+the testing package. 
+
+The port to the "tiny" operating system has been removed. It is unmaintained
+and untested. It was a toy to show that Go can run on raw hardware and it
+served its purpose. The source code will of course remain in the repository
+history, so it could be brought back if needed later.
+
+This release also changes some of the internal structure of the memory
+allocator in preparation for other garbage collector changes. 
+If you run into problems, please let us know.
+There is one known issue that we are aware of but have not debugged yet:
+	http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=1464&.
