    cmd/go: describe dependencies in build list error messages
    
    mvs.BuildList reports errors with a chain of modules to make it
    clear why the module where the error occurred was part of the
    build. This is a little confusing with "go get -u" since there are
    edges in the module graph for requirements and for updates.
    
    With this change, we now print "requires" or "updates to" between
    each module version in the chain.
    
    Updates #30661
