commit 22a6747999cc25291d2cad0481c95b0cf4d71ab8

    Per discussion earlier today with r and gri: when an interface
    object has a value of type "int", it should not automatically
    convert to type "int32".  That is, the type alias "int" should
    be regarded as having been defined as though "type int int32"
    appeared outside of the package, and as therefore being a
    different type from "int32".
