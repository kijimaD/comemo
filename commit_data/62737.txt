    runtime: add thread exit plus vgetrandom stress test
    
    Add a regression test similar to the reproducer from #73141 to try to
    help catch future issues with vgetrandom and thread exit. Though the
    test isn't very precise, it just hammers thread exit.
    
    When the test reproduces #73141, it simply crashes with a SIGSEGV and no
    output or stack trace, which would be very unfortunate on a builder.
    https://go.dev/issue/49165 tracks collecting core dumps from builders,
    which would make this more tractable to debug.
    
    For #73141.
