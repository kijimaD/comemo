    cmd/go: fix tests for new builder environment
    
    Fix two long tests that fail in the builders we're trying out:
    
    - TestQueryImport was failing with:
      open /nonexist-gopath/pkg/sumdb/sum.golang.org/latest: no such file or directory
      which eventually turns out to be because it couldn't create
      /nonexist-gopath because it wasn't running as root. The test already
      uses a temporary GOPATH, but missed overriding a configuration
      variable set at init time.
    - test_flags fails if the working directory has /x/ in it, which it now
      happens to.
