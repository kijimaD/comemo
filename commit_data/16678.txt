    runtime: shorten hash lookup stack frames
    
    On amd64 the frames are very close to the limit for a
    nosplit (textflag 7) function, in part because the C compiler
    does not make any attempt to reclaim space allocated for
    completely registerized variables. Avoid a few short-lived
    variables to reclaim two words.
