    .github: update ISSUE_TEMPLATE to be closer to 'go bug'
    
    Ask whether the issue reproduces with the latest release.
    
    'go bug' places the version and system details last,
    in part because they're automatically filled.
    I'd like to do the same here, but I worry
    that they'll get ignored.
