    cmd/go: make get_dash_t test more specific
    
    Currently it uses "go list ...", which includes all packages in
    the known universe, and may include unresolved dependencies. The
    test for issue #8181 is specifically for that the test dependency
    of package b is downloaded. Test that specifically.
