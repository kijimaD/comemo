+A new experimental garbage collector is now available as an experiment. The
+new design aims to improve the efficiency of garbage collection through better
+locality and CPU scalability in the mark algorithm. Benchmark result vary, but
+we expect somewhere between a 10â€”40% reduction in garbage collection overhead
+in real-world programs that heavily use the garbage collector.
+
+The new garbage collector may be enabled by setting `GOEXPERIMENT=greenteagc`
+at build time. See the [GitHub issue](/issue/73581) for more details on the design
+and instructions on how to report feedback.
