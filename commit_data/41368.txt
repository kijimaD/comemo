    crypto/tls: update ExampleDial with a valid root
    
    When run as a separate program, the code in ExampleDial panicked due to
    an expired certificate. Fixed this problem by replacing the expired
    certificate with a valid one.
    
    Also added a comment in the certificate to give a hint about why it
    might fail in the future.
    
    Fixes #35706
