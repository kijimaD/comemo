    all: change github.com issue links to golang.org
    
    The go repository contains a mix of github.com/golang/go/issues/xxxxx
    and golang.org/issues/xxxxx URLs for references to issues in the issue
    tracker. We should use one for consistency, and golang.org is preferred
    in case the project moves the issue tracker in the future.
    
    This reasoning is taken from a comment Sam Whited left on a CL I
    recently opened: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/73890.
    
    In that CL I referenced an issue using its github.com URL, because other
    tests in the file I was changing contained references to issues using
    their github.com URL. Sam Whited left a comment on the CL stating I
    should change it to the golang.org URL.
    
    If new code is intended to reference issues via golang.org and not
    github.com, existing code should be updated so that precedence exists
    for contributors who are looking at the existing code as a guide for the
    code they should write.
