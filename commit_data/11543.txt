    mat/big: add raw access to Int bits
    
    This is a minimal API extension, it makes it possible
    to implement missing Int functionality externally w/o
    compromising efficiency. It is the hope that this will
    reduce the number of feature requests going directly
    into the big package.
    
    Also: Fixed some naming inconsistencies: The receiver
    is only called z when it is also the result.
