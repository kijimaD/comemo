    cmd/go: fix including of _cgo_export.h
    
    This will add the temporary object directory into the lookup
    path so that cgo-exported function declarations may be
    included from C files.
    
    This was previously applied by CL 5600043, and apparently
    removed by mistake on CL 5598045.
