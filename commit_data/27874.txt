    math/rand: Document origin of cooked pseudo-random numbers
    
    The Source provided by math/rand relies on an array of cooked
    pseudo-random 63bit integers for seeding. The origin of these
    numbers is undocumented.
    
    Add a standalone program in math/rand folder that generates
    the 63bit integer array as well as a 64bit version supporting
    extension of the Source to 64bit pseudo-random number
    generation while maintaining the current sequence in the
    lower 63bit.
    
    The code is largely based on the initial implementation of the
    random number generator in the go repository by Ken Thompson
    (revision 399).
