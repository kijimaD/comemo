    misc/cgo/testplugin: disable DWARF tests on darwin
    
    For some reason on darwin the linker still can't add debug sections to
    plugins. Executables importing "plugin" do have them, however.
    
    Because of issue 25841, plugins on darwin would likely have bad debug
    info anyway so, for now, this isn't a great loss.
    
    This disables the check for debug sections in plugins for darwin only.
    
    Updates #27502
