    cmd/go: remove confusing TrimPrefix(str, "\n")
    
    It's not clear why strings here would have a *prefix* \n. This trim
    was introduced back in March 2012 without explanation in omnibus
    commit b03a5f66e8f8a6b36c9d67e82d2edc9b3d4076ba (as a HasPrefix, since
    we didn't have TrimPrefix at the time).
