    runtime: fix floating point exception on Plan 9
    
    Change 5660047 moved an FLDCW instruction
    that disables invalid operand traps into
    runtime路asminit, which is called from
    runtime路mstart. Thus, runtime路check is being
    called prior to setting the appropriate control bits,
    which on any QNaN comparison will cause Plan 9
    to take an invalid operand trap. This change loads
    the control bits (for Plan 9) prior to runtime路check.
    Ideally, this should be done before the QNaN checks
    on any system, but possibly other kernels simply
    don't ever trap on invalid operands.
