    cmd/api: disallow silent API additions after api/go1.n.txt is created
    
    At this time, the golang.org/s/release process arranges such that the
    api/go1.n.txt file is created when a Go 1.N Beta 1 release is being cut.
    The API check is currently configured so that tests don't fail visibly
    even if api/go1.n.txt becomes a subset of the actual API additions in
    the upcoming Go 1.N release as long as 'go version' has "devel" in it.
    The first time that 'go version' output drops the "devel" substring
    during testing is after the release-branch.go1.N branch is created
    as part of the process to cut a Go 1.N Release Candidate 1 release.
    
    The month or so between Beta 1 and RC 1 is well into the freeze and
    deliberate API changes are rare and very intentional. There seems to
    be agreement that it's healthy to make the API check stricter during
    that time period. Doing so will ensure that api/go1.n.txt cannot get
    stale after creation without anyone noticing, and may catch CLs that
    don't have the intended diff on the API.
    
    This CL changes behavior to be simple and clear: from the moment
    an api/go1.n.txt file corresponding to the current Go version in
    development is added to the tree, silent API additions stop being
    permitted.
    
    This CL also moves the magical "override the value of -allow_new flag
    if runtime.Version() contains 'devel' string" behavior from cmd/api
    command to the run.go script that calls it, making the CLI of cmd/api
    itself less surprising.
    
    Fixes #43956.
