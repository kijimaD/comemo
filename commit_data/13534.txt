    misc/dashboard/codereview: add LastUpdate field to CL
    
    To be filled in by a later CL. I deployed a test version to
    App Engine to work on setting the values, so there are
    a few records that have this field set already.
    
    That field is breaking the live version, so I have pushed
    a new copy with this 1-line change to the live version
    
    I assumed that appengine/datastore was like every other
    marshaling and unmarshaling package we have in Go
    (for example, encoding/gob, encoding/json, encoding/xml,
    and protobuf) and that if it loaded an unknown field it would
    just ignore it. Apparently not. Sorry.
