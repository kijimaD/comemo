commit 3d3b4906f94a40b7dd2e66ad3ad48e86b5ce6f89

    cmd/6g: peephole fixes/additions
    
    * Shift/rotate by constant doesn't have to stop subprop. (also in 8g)
    * Remove redundant MOVLQZX instructions.
    * An attempt at issuing loads early.
      Good for 0.5% on a good day, might not be worth keeping.
      Need to understand more about whether the x86
      looks ahead to what loads might be coming up.
