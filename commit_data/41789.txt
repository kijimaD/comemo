    cmd/internal/obj/x86: correct pcsp for ADJSP
    
    The x86 assembler supports an "ADJSP" pseudo-op that compiles to an
    ADD/SUB from SP. Unfortunately, while this seems perfect for an
    instruction that would allow obj to continue to track the SP/FP delta,
    obj currently doesn't do that. As a result, FP-relative references
    won't work and, perhaps worse, the pcsp table will have the wrong
    frame size.
    
    We don't currently use this instruction in any assembly or generate it
    in the compiler, but this is a perfect instruction for solving a
    problem in #24543.
    
    This CL makes ADJSP useful by incorporating it into the SP delta
    logic.
    
    One subtlety is that we do generate ADJSP in obj itself to open a
    function's stack frame. Currently, when preprocess enters the loop to
    compute the SP delta, it may or may not start at this ADJSP
    instruction depending on various factors. We clean this up by instead
    always starting the SP delta at 0 and always starting this loop at the
    entry to the function.
    
    Why not just recognize ADD/SUB of SP? The danger is that could change
    the meaning of existing code. For example, walltime1 in
    sys_linux_amd64.s saves SP, SUBs from it, and aligns it. Later, it
    restores the saved copy and then does a few FP-relative references.
    Currently obj doesn't know any of this is happening, but that's fine
    once it gets to the FP-relative references. If we taught obj to
    recognize the SUB, it would start to miscompile this code. An
    alternative would be to recognize unknown instructions that write to
    SP and refuse subsequent FP-relative references, but that's kind of
    annoying.
    
    This passes toolstash -cmp for std on both amd64 and 386.
