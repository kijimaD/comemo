    cmd/compile,cmd/asm: fix buglet in -S=2 output
    
    In CL 255718 the -S=2 assembly output was enhanced to dump symbol
    ABIs. This patch fixes a bug in that CL: when dumping the relocations
    on a symbol, we were dumping the symbol's ABI as opposed to the
    relocation target symbol's ABI.
