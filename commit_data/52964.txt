    cmd/trace: add basic documentation to main page
    
    This change adds rudimentary explanation of the various
    visualizations to main page of the trace server.
    There is clearly a vast amount one could write here,
    especially in the form of tutorials, but I've tried to
    restrict it to just basic conceptual overview.
