    test: relax live.go for GOEXPERIMENT=unified
    
    This CL applies the same change to test/live.go that was previously
    applied to test/live_regabi.go in golang.org/cl/415240. This wasn't
    noticed at the time though, because GOEXPERIMENT=unified was only
    being tested on linux-amd64, which is a regabi platform.
