    internal/trace/v2: halve the memory footprint of TestGCStress
    
    This test has been OOMing on 32-bit platforms for a bit. I suspect the
    very high allocation rate is causing the program to outrun the GC in
    some corner-case scenarios, especially on 32-bit Windows.
    
    I don't have a strong grasp of what's going on yet, but lowering the
    memory footprint should help with the flakiness. This shouldn't
    represent a loss in test coverage, since we're still allocating and
    assisting plenty (tracing the latter is a strong reason this test
    exists).
    
    For #66624.
