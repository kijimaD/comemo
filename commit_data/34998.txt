    cmd/go: disable tests when GOOS/GOARCH != GOHOSTARCH/GOHOSTARCH
    
    The whole GOROOT/pkg tree is installed using the GOHOSTOS/GOHOSTARCH
    toolchain (installed in GOROOT/pkg/tool/GOHOSTOS_GOHOSTARCH).
    The testgo.exe we run during the cmd/go test will be built
    for GOOS/GOARCH, which means it will use the GOOS/GOARCH toolchain
    (installed in GOROOT/pkg/tool/GOOS_GOARCH).
    
    If these are not the same toolchain, then the entire standard library
    will look out of date to testgo.exe (the compilers in those two different
    tool directories are built for different architectures and have different
    buid IDs), which will cause many tests to do unnecessary rebuilds
    and some tests to attempt to overwrite the installed standard library,
    which will in turn make it look out of date to whatever runs after the
    cmd/go test exits.
    
    Bail out entirely in this case instead of destroying the world.
    
    The changes outside TestMain are checks that might have caught
    this a bit earlier and made it much less confusing to debug.
    
    Fixes #22709.
    Fixes #22965.
