    websocket: add mutex to make websocket full-duplex
    
    One benefit of websocket is that it is full-duplex so that it could
    send and receive at the same time.
    This CL makes websocket goroutine safe, so user could use websocket
    both on goroutine for read and on goroutine for write.
