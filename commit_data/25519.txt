    cmd/go: skip TestBuildOutputToDevNull on Plan 9
    
    TestBuildOutputToDevNull was added in CL 16585.
    However, copying to /dev/null couldn't work on Plan 9,
    because /dev/null is a regular file. Since it's not
    different from any other file, the logic in copyFile
    couldn't distinguish it from another, already existing,
    file, that we wouldn't want to overwrite.
