    cmd/go: fix at least some instances of double compilation
    
    When the packages the tested package depends on don't build,
    we weren't getting out early. Added a simple check for a successful
    build to an existing early out.
    
    There may be other ways that double compilation arises, but
    this fixes the one listed in the issue.
    Fixes #5679
