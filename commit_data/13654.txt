    exp/locale/collate/build: fixed bug that was exposed by experimenting
    with table changes.
    NOTE: there is no test for this, but 1) the code has now the same
    control flow as scan in exp/locale/collate/contract.go, which is
    tested and 2) Builder verifies the generated table so bugs in this
    code are quickly and easily found (which is how this bug was discovered).
