    cmd/compile: rework handling of udiv on ARM
    
    Instead of populating the aux symbol
    of CALLudiv during rewrite rules,
    populate it during genssa.
    
    This simplifies the rewrite rules.
    It also removes all remaining calls
    to ctxt.Lookup from any rewrite rules.
    This is a first step towards removing
    ctxt from ssa.Cache entirely,
    and also a first step towards converting
    the obj.LSym.Version field into a boolean.
    It should also speed up compilation.
    
    Also, move func udiv into package runtime.
    That's where it is anyway,
    and it lets udiv look and act like the rest of
    the runtime support functions.
