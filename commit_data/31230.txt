    runtime: make _MaxMem an untyped constant
    
    Currently _MaxMem is a uintptr, which is going to complicate some
    further changes. Make it untyped so we'll be able to do untyped math
    on it before truncating it to a uintptr.
    
    The runtime assembly is identical before and after this change on
    {linux,windows}/{amd64,386}.
    
    Updates #18651.
