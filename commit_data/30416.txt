    testing: add T.Context method
    
    From the doc comment:
    
    Context returns the context for the current test or benchmark.
    The context is cancelled when the test or benchmark finishes.
    A goroutine started during a test or benchmark can wait for the
    context's Done channel to become readable as a signal that the
    test or benchmark is over, so that the goroutine can exit.
    
    Fixes #16221.
    Fixes #17552.
