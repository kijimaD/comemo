    runtime: drop _SigUnblock for SIGSYS on Linux
    
    The _SigUnblock flag was appended to SIGSYS slot of runtime signal table
    for Linux in https://go-review.googlesource.com/22202, but there is
    still no concrete opinion on whether SIGSYS must be an unblocked signal
    for runtime.
    
    This change removes _SigUnblock flag from SIGSYS on Linux for
    consistency in runtime signal handling and adds a reference to #15204 to
    runtime signal table for FreeBSD.
    
    Updates #15204.
