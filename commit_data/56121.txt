    go/types: ObjectString: remove only 1 Alias for "type A = RHS"
    
    As we migrate towards materialized Alias types, the ObjectString
    for a type A such as
       type A = B
       type B = int
    should be "type A = B", removing exactly one Alias constructor
    from the type of A. (The previous behavior was "type A = int".)
    
    I suspect the existing Alias.{Unalias,Underlying} API is
    inadequate and that we will need an Alias.RHS accessor that
    removes exactly one Alias. Other clients such as the import/
    export packages will need it, because aliases are not
    isomorphic to defined types, in which, given
       type A B
       type B int
    the Underlying of A is indeed int. See #66559.
