    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: cleanup wrapper code for generics
    
    Simple change - added some comments, but also removed some TODO comments
    which are now done or no longer a question. Cleaned up the initial check
    for generic methods.
    
    The one remaining TODO that really needs to be done is generating
    dictionary wrappers for any methods involving embedded fields. Given we
    are not doing this, I think this would only affect if a struct with an
    embedded field with methods was converted to an interface containing the
    embedded method, and then the method was called via that interface.
