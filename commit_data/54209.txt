    cmd/compile: limit goroutine count to parallelism
    
    When the compiler crashes, it is not uncommon to see many hundreds
    of goroutines all blocked waiting their turn to be one of the nWorkers
    goroutines that is allowed to run. All these goroutine stacks are not a
    terribly efficient use of memory, and they also make the crash dumps
    hard to read.
    
    Introduce a manager goroutine to hand out work to at most nWorker
    goroutines, maintaining pending work in a local slice, rather than
    having all those blocked goroutines hanging around waiting to run.
