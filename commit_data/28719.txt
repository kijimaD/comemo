    cmd/trace: label mark termination spans as such
    
    Currently these are labeled "MARK", which was accurate in the STW
    collector, but these really indicate mark termination now, since
    marking happens for the full duration of the concurrent GC. Re-label
    them as "MARK TERMINATION" to clarify this.
