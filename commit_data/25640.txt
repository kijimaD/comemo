    cmd/internal/obj, cmd/link, runtime: increase stack limit to accommodate larger frames on ppc64x
    
    Larger stack frames mean nosplit functions use more stack and so the limit
    needs to increase.
    
    The change to test/nosplit.go is a bit ugly but I can't really think of a
    way to make it nicer.
