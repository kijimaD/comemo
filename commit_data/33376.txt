    runtime: initialize itab.hash always
    
    We weren't initializing this field for dynamically-generated itabs.
    Turns out it doesn't matter, as any time we use this field we also
    generate a static itab for the interface type / concrete type pair.
    But we should initialize it anyway, just to be safe.
    
    Performance on the benchmarks in CL 44339:
    benchmark               old ns/op     new ns/op     delta
    BenchmarkItabFew-12     1040585       26466         -97.46%
    BenchmarkItabAll-12     228873499     4287696       -98.13%
