    internal/concurrent: make HashTrieMap iteration more idiomatic
    
    Currently a HashTrieMap has a method called Enumerate whose method
    closure is an iter.Seq2, but the current convention is to name the
    method All and return an iter.Seq2. This is an easy transformation, so
    do it now.
