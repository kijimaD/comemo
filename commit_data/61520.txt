    cmd/go: track root failing Action
    
    Currently, each Action tracks whether it failed, which is propagated
    up from dependencies. Shortly, we'll need to know the root cause if a
    test fails because of a build failure. To support this, replace the
    Failed boolean with a Failed *Action that tracks the root Action that
    failed and caused other Actions to fail.
    
    For #62067.
