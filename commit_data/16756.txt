    undo CL 11161044 / ba455262a9db
    
    I want to think more carefully about this.
    
    We put this in because Marshal encoded named []byte but Unmarshal rejected them.
    And we noticed that Marshal's behavior was undocumented so we documented it.
    But I am starting to think the docs and Unmarshal were correct and Marshal's
    behavior was the problem.
    
    Rolling back to give us more time to think.
    
    ««« original CL description
    json: unmarshal types that are byte slices.
    
    The json package cheerfully would marshal
    
            type S struct {
                    IP net.IP
            }
    
    but would give an error when unmarshalling.  This change allows any
    type whose concrete type is a byte slice to be unmarshalled from a
    string.
    
    Fixes #5086.
