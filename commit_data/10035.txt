commit 389d55fadf8ed166cc06c016d9eae3dda5e249b8
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    build: pass $GCFLAGS to compiler
    
    For example, if you are debugging an optimization
    problem you can now run
    
            GCFLAGS=-N gotest
    
    This is a convention for make, not for the general build,
    so it may go away or be done differently in the eventual
    'go' command.
    
    The plan is that people will be able to test their code for
    rune safety by doing GCFLAGS=-r.
