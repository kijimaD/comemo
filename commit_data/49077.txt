    debug/pe: rework reading of aux symbols to fix endianity problems
    
    This patch reworks CL 394534 to fix things so that reading auxiliary
    symbol info works properly in a cross-endian mode (running
    debug/pe-based tool on a big-endian system). The previous
    implementation read in all symbol records using the primary symbol
    format, then just used a pointer cast to convert to the auxiliary
    format, which doesn't play well if host and target have different
    endianness.
    
    Fixes #52079.
