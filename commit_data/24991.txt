    cmd/go: skip external tests on linux/arm
    
    CL 13166 skipped external tests on freebsd/arm with the rationale
    that the cmd/go tests are not architecture dependent.
    
    This CL does the same for linux/arm to help linux/arm users who are
    building Go on platforms like the Raspberry Pi where ./all.bash
    frequently times out due to a lack of resources.
