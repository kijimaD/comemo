    [dev.link] cmd/link: handle multiple levels of overwrite
    
    Revamp the way that symbol overwrites are handled to deal with symbols
    that are overwritten more than once (such as "_cgo_mmap"). The
    scenario here is that a symbol can be overwritten twice, once during
    preload, and then again when host objects are read during internal
    linking. This can result in a situation where we have two entries in
    the overwrite map, from X -> Y and then from Y -> Z. Rather than
    search the overwrite map when adding new entries, add a helper routine
    for querying the map that catches this situation and fixes it up.
    
    Also with this patch is a couple of tweaks to the loader.Dump method
    to insure that it can dump the entire global index space without
    crashing due to odd overwrites (as in the scenario above).
