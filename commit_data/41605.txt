    runtime: skip TestSignalIgnoreSIGTRAP on known-flaky OpenBSD builders
    
    This test is flaky, and the cause is suspected to be an OpenBSD kernel bug.
    Since there is no obvious workaround on the Go side, skip the test on
    builders whose versions are known to be affected.
    
    Fixes #17496
