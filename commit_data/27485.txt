commit 30fc940c70ee5ee27f0a455248735b8b57f34fb7

    go/types: don't drop type in n:1 var decl if one is given
    
    In n:1 variable declarations (multiple lhs variables with single
    multi-valued initialization expression) where also a variable
    type is provided, make sure that that type is assigned to all
    variables on the lhs before the init expression assignment is
    checked. Otherwise, (some) variables are assumed to take the type
    of the corresponding value of the multi-valued init expression.
    
    Fixes #15755.
