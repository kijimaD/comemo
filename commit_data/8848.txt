    fmt: Added SkipSpace() function to fmt's ScanState interface.
    
    Users of the Scan() infrastructure that employ ReadRune() rather than
    Token() need a way to skip leading spaces and newlines as set by the
    the parent, Fscan(), Fscanln, or Fscanf(). As the internal methods and
    boolean flags are not exported, this new function was added here and
    in the Int and Nat Scan() functions of the big package. (fmt.Rat did
    not need change since it uses Token()) Also added Printf style format
    code support to int types and tests for same to int_test.go
