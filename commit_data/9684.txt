    crypto/tls: support SSLv3
    
    It would be nice not to have to support this since all the clients
    that we care about support TLSv1 by now. However, due to buggy
    implementations of SSLv3 on the Internet which can't do version
    negotiation correctly, browsers will sometimes switch to SSLv3. Since
    there's no good way for a browser tell a network problem from a buggy
    server, this downgrade can occur even if the server in question is
    actually working correctly.
    
    So we need to support SSLv3 for robustness :(
    
    Fixes #1703.
