    crypto/x509: omit empty extensions SEQUENCE
    
    In CreateCertificate, if there are no extensions, don't include the
    extensions SEQUENCE in the encoded certificate.
    
    Why, you might ask, does the encoding/asn1 tag 'optional' not do
    the same thing as 'omitempty'? Good question, no clue, fixing that
    would probably break things in horrific ways.
    
    Fixes #52319
