    ld: fix alignment of rodata section on Plan 9
    
    This was causing a panic in the reflect package
    since type.* pointers with their low bits set are
    assumed to have certain flags set that disallow
    the use of reflection.
    
    Thanks to Pavel and Taru for help tracking down
    this bug.
