    Revert "runtime: fix lldb test after DWARF compression"
    
    This reverts commit c99300229de4e69220790c71da14785dc52c3d68.
    
    The original CL skipped the lldb test if it couldn't read compressed
    DWARF, but lldb can never read compressed DWARF, so this effectively
    disabled this test unconditionally.
    
    The previous commit disabled DWARF compression for this test, so the
    test now works on its own merits again. This CL reverts the change to
    skip the test so we don't simply mask lldb failures.
    
    Updates #25925.
