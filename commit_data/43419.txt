    cmd/compile: mark 'store multiple' as clobbering flags on s390x
    
    Store multiple instructions can clobber flags on s390x when the
    offset passed into the assembler is outside the range representable
    with a signed 20 bit integer. This is because the assembler uses
    the agfi instruction to implement the large offset. The assembler
    could use a different sequence of instructions, but for now just
    mark the instruction as 'clobberFlags' since this is risk free.
    
    Noticed while investigating #38195.
    
    No test yet since I'm not sure how to get this bug to trigger and
    I haven't seen it affect real code.
