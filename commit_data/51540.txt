    cmd/go: mention go.work when local path outside modules in go.work
    
    In workspace mode, if a user lists a package or patternthat's inside a
    module that's not listed in go.work, mention that the package or pattern
    is outside the modules listed in go.work so the user has a better idea
    of how to fix the issue.
    
    (Question: it's valid in those flows to add a pattern that points into
    the module cache. Should we expand the error to say "package outside
    modules listed in go.work file or contained in module cache"? That seems
    clunky (and is the uncommon case) which is why I didn't do so in this
    case, but it's possible)
    
    Fixes #49632
