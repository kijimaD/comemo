-<p> The Go project was conceived to make it easier to write the kind
-of servers and other software Google uses internally, but the
-implementation isn't quite mature enough yet for large-scale
-production use.  While we continue development we are also doing
-experiments with the language as a candidate server environment.  It's

+<p>Yes. There are now several Go programs deployed in 
+production inside Google.  For instance, the server behind

 <code>Gc</code> uses a different calling convention and linker and can
 therefore only be linked with C programs using the same convention.
-There is such a C compiler but no C++ compiler. <code>Gccgo</code> is a

-C or C++ programs. However, because Go is garbage-collected it will be
-unwise to do so, at least naively.
