    container/list: make Remove return Value of removed element.
    When it is known that there is already at least one element in the
    list, it is awkwardly verbose to use three lines and an extra
    variable declaration to remove the first or last item (a common
    case), rather than use a simple expression.
    
    a stack:
            stk.PushFront(x)
            x = stk.Front().Remove().(T)
    
    vs.
            stk.PushFront(x)
            e := stk.Front()
            e.Remove()
            x = e.Value.(T)
    [An alternative CL might be to add PopFront and PopBack methods].
