    go spec: define make() restrictions as for index expressions
    
    This is a language change: Until now, the spec required run-
    time panics for some of these errors. Note that gc and gccgo
    implemented this inconsistently, and that both compilers already
    reported compile-time errors in some cases. This change makes
    make() behave along the same vein as index expressions.
    
    This addresses the spec aspect of issue 4085.
