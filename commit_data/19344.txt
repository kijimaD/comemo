    runtime: handle decommit failure gracefully on Windows
    
    I have no test case for this at tip.
    The original report included a program crashing at revision 88ac7297d2fa.
    I tested this code at that revision and it does fix the crash.
    However, at tip the reported code no longer crashes, presumably
    because some allocation patterns have changed. I believe the
    bug is still present at tip and that this code still fixes it.
    
    Fixes #7143.
