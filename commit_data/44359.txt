    [dev.link] cmd/link: refactor dwarf gen methods to be comp-unit centric
    
    Refactor some of the linker's DWARF generation methods so as to have
    helper routines that do all the work for a given comp unit for a given
    section (range, loc, etc). No change in functionality, this is just a
    reorg in preparation for a later patch in this sequence.
