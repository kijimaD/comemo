    html: refactor parse test infrastructure
    
    My excuse for doing this is that test cases with newlines in them didn't
    work. But instead of just fixing that, I rearranged everything in
    parse_test.go to use fewer channels and pipes, and just call a
    straightforward function to read test cases from a file.
