    testing: document that benchmark logs are dumped to stdout
    
    The doc for testing.T and testing.B said that both test and benchmark
    logs are printed to stderr, but in reality that wasn't the case.
    
    CL 24311 fixed the doc for T, this change fixes it for B.
    
    Fixes #36257
