    cmd/compile: rename poset method dominates to reaches
    
    The partially ordered set uses a method named 'dominates' to determine whether
    two nodes are partially ordered. Dominates does a depth-first search of the
    DAG, beginning at the source node, and returns true as soon as it finds a path
    to the target node. In the context of the forest-of-DAGs that makes up the
    poset, dominates is not necessarily checking dominance, but is checking
    reachability. See the issue tracker for a more detailed discussion of the
    difference.
    
    Fortunately, reachability is logically correct everywhere dominates is currently
    used in poset.go. Reachability within a DAG is sufficient to establish the
    partial ordering (source < target).
    
    This CL changes the name of the method (dominates -> reaches) and updates
    all the comments in the file accordingly.
    
    Fixes #33971.
