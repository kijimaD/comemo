    cmd/compile: simplify error sorting
    
    Errors have unique seq values (their index within the errors slice),
    so errcmp never needs to fallback to sorting by message text.
    Moreover, comparing by original index is exactly the purpose of using
    a stable sort algorithm (and sort.Stable was added in Go 1.2), so we
    really only need to compare by lineno.
