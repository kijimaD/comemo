    runtime: don't clear procid on netbsd
    
    This is a partial revert of CL 526118.
    
    NetBSD uses mp.procid in locking (semawake). unminit is called
    surprisingly early in mexit, and there is definitely locking after that
    point, so it isn't safe to clear procid so early.
    
    Fixes #62524.
    Fixes #62531.
