    cmd/compile: remove check that Zero's arg has the correct base type
    
    It doesn't have to. The type in the aux field is authoritative.
    There are cases involving casting from interface{} where pointers
    have a placeholder pointer type (because the type is not known when
    the IData op is generated).
    
    The check was introduced in CL 13447.
    
    Fixes #39459
