    go/doc: ignore example functions with arguments
    
    An Example function with arguments is not a valid example to be
    run with go test. Don't return those functions from Examples. This
    means that some functions that were previously showing up in
    Examples will no longer show up. But those functions were not being
    tested properly so the fact that they were showing up is misleading.
    
    This fixes an issue where a confusing compiler error was showing
    up when running go test on a file with an invalid example. While
    that issue could have been fixed by returning an error, this is
    more consistent with the behavior of go/doc.Examples, and the tests
    checker in vet will catch this issue.
    
    Fixes #35284
