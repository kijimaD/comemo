    os: remove incorrect detection of O_CLOEXEC flag on darwin
    
    The below range loop will not stop when encountering
    the first '.' character in a Darwin version string like "15.6.0".
    
    for i = range osver {
       if osver[i] != '.' {
             continue
          }
       }
    }
    
    Therefore, the condition i > 2 was always satisfied and
    supportsCloseOnExec was always set to true.
    
    Since the minimum supported version of OSX for go is currently 10.8
    and O_CLOEXEC is implemented from OSX 10.7 on the detection code
    can be removed and support for O_CLOEXEC is always assumed to exist.
