    cmd/objdump: rewrite in Go
    
    Update cmd/dist not to build the C version.
    Update cmd/go to install the Go version to the tool directory.
    
    Update #7452
    
    This is the basic logic needed for objdump, and it works well enough
    to support the pprof list and weblist commands. A real disassembler
    needs to be added in order to support the pprof disasm command
    and the per-line assembly displays in weblist. That's still to come.
    
    Probably objdump will move to go.tools when the disassembler
    is added, but it can stay here for now.
