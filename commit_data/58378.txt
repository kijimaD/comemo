    syscall: copy rlimit.go's build constraint to rlimit_test.go
    
    Tests in rlimit_test.go exist to test the behavior of automatically
    bumping RLIMIT_NOFILE on Unix implemented in rlimit.go (issue #46279),
    with darwin-specific behavior split out into rlimit_darwin.go and
    the rest left empty in rlimit_stub.go.
    
    Since the behavior happens only on Unix, it doesn't make sense to test
    it on other platforms. Copy rlimit.go's 'unix' build constraint to
    rlimit_test.go to accomplish that.
    
    Also simplify the build constraint in rlimit_stub.go while here,
    so that its maintenance is easier and it starts to match all
    non-darwin Unix GOOS values (previously, 'hurd' happened to be missed).
    
    In particular, this fixes a problem where TestOpenFileLimit was
    failing in some environments when testing the wasip1/wasm port.
    The RLIMIT_NOFILE bumping behavior isn't implemented there, so
    the test was testing the environment and not the Go project.
    
    Updates #46279.
    For #61116.
