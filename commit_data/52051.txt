    cmd/link: default to external linking with cgo std packages
    
    Previously, when a program depends on cgo packages in the standard
    library (e.g. net, os/user) but not otherwise use cgo, we default
    to internal linking mode. As we shipped pre-built cgo-using packages
    in Go distributions, we don't require a C compiler to build those
    packages. Then, by using internal linking we can link programs
    using those packages without requiring a C toolchain.
    
    As of Go 1.20, we stopped shipping those pre-built packages. If a
    user doesn't have a C toolchain, they will use the non-cgo version
    of the package. If they have a C toolchain, they can get cgo-using
    packages but they can link with the external linker as well. So
    there is no strong need to be able to link the cgo version of the
    packages without a C toolchain. This CL makes it default to
    external linking mode.
    
    Fixes #58619.
    Fixes #58620.
