    encoding/json: obey SetEscapeHTML in all MarshalJSON cases
    
    It wasn't obeyed in the case where the MarshalJSON method uses a pointer
    receiver, and the encoder grabs the address of a value to find that
    method. addrMarshalerEncoder is the function that does this work, but it
    ignored opts.escapeHTML.
    
    Here's the before and after of the added test case, which was failing
    before the fix. Now the two cases are correct and consistent.
    
            {"NonPtr":"<str>","Ptr":"\u003cstr\u003e"}
            {"NonPtr":"<str>","Ptr":"<str>"}
    
    Fixes #32896.
