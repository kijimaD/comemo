    net/http/httptest: protect against port reuse
    
    Should make BSDs more reliable. (they seem to reuse ports
    quicker than Linux)
    
    Tested by hand with local modifications to force reuse on
    Linux. (net/http tests failed before, pass now) Details in the
    issue.
    
    Fixes #4436
