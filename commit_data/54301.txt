    Revert "os/exec: make StdoutPipe and StderrPipe safe to Close concurrently"
    
    This reverts CL 437176.
    
    Reason for revert: broke programs that plumb StdoutPipe from one command to Stdin on another and then call Wait on the former.
    
    os/exec itself uses a type-assertion to *os.File to determine whether to copy stdin using a goroutine or just pass a file descriptor. An early Wait using a *os.File is benign (because closing the pipe doesn't close the child's inherited file descriptor), but an early Wait using a non-*os.File is not.
    
    Updates #50436.
