    internal/fuzz: improve minimizing message
    
    In order to know the actual number of bytes
    of the entire corpus entry, the coordinator
    would likely need to unmarshal the bytes and
    tally up the length. That's more work than it
    is worth, so this change just clarifies that
    the printed # of bytes is the length of the
    entire file, not just the entry itself.
    
    Fixes #48989
