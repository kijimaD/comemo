commit 1192c175fe2e82adba91c7485b458e65c6a61e70
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>

    Correct _cgo_free when C ABI does not pass first arg on stack.
    
    It turns out that _cgo_malloc is used, via cmalloc in
    runtime/cgocall.c, which is called by code generated by out.go
    for the Â·_C_CString function.  I can't find a call to
    _cgo_free, but given _cgo_malloc we might as well keep
    _cgo_free.  This patch fixes it so that it should work on
    amd64.
