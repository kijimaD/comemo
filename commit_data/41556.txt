    net/http: fix handling of HTTP/2 upgrade failures
    
    If an error occurs during the HTTP/2 upgrade phase, originally this
    resulted in a pconn with pconn.alt set to an http2erringRoundTripper,
    which always fails. This is not wanted - we want to retry in this case.
    
    CL 202078 added a check for the http2erringRoundTripper to treat it
    as a failed pconn, but the handling of the failure was wrong in the case
    where the pconn is not in the idle list at all (common in HTTP/2).
    This made the added test TestDontCacheBrokenHTTP2Conn flaky.
    
    CL 218097 (unsubmitted) proposed to expand the handling of the
    http2erringRoundTripper after the new check, to dispose of the pconn
    more thoroughly. Bryan Mills pointed out in that review that we probably
    shouldn't make the never-going-to-work pconn in the first place.
    
    This CL changes the upgrade phase look for the http2erringRoundTripper
    and return the underlying error instead of claiming to have a working
    connection. Having done that, the CL undoes the change in CL 202078
    and with it the need for CL 218097, but it keeps the new test added
    by CL 202078.
    
    On my laptop, before this commit, TestDontCacheBrokenHTTP2Conn
    failed 66 times out of 20,000. With this commit, I see 0 out of 20,000.
    
    Fixes #34978.
    Fixes #35113.
