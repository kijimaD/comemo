    runtime: increase number of stack orders to 4
    
    Cache 2KB, 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB stacks.  Larger stacks
    will be allocated directly.  There is no point in cacheing
    32KB+ stacks as we ask for and return 32KB at a time
    from the allocator.
    
    Note that the minimum stack is 8K on windows/64bit and 4K on
    windows/32bit and plan9.  For these os/arch combinations,
    the number of stack orders is less so that we have the same
    maximum cached size.
    
    Fixes #9045
