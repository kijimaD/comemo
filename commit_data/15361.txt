commit f466617a620ce98a7a6a84f51621458641a0c38f

    cmd/5g, cmd/5l, cmd/6l, cmd/8l, cmd/gc, cmd/ld, runtime: accurate args and locals information
    
    Previously, the func structure contained an inaccurate value for
    the args member and a 0 value for the locals member.
    
    This change populates the func structure with args and locals
    values computed by the compiler.  The number of args was
    already available in the ATEXT instruction.  The number of
    locals is now passed through in the new ALOCALS instruction.
    
    This change also switches the unit of args and locals to be
    bytes, just like the frame member, instead of 32-bit words.
