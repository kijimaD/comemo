    cmd/5a, cmd/6a, cmd/8a: fix .y files to match y.tab.[ch]
    
    When I renamed LAddr back to Addr (before sending the
    original linker CLs), I missed the .y files in my global substitute.
    Since the .y files are only processed when running make in
    one of those directories (not during all.bash), they were
    behind the generated files.
