    cmd/compile: don't modify nodfp in AllocFrame
    
    nodfp is a global, so modifying it is unsafe in a concurrent backend.
    It is also not necessary, since the Used marks
    are only relevant for nodes in fn.Dcl.
    For good measure, mark nodfp as always used.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
    
    Updates #15756
