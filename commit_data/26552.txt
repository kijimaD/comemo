    runtime: don't expose stack buffer in stringto{byte,rune}slice
    
    When using a stack-allocated buffer for the result, don't
    expose the uninitialized portion of it by restricting its
    capacity to its length.
    
    The other option is to zero the portion between len and cap.
    That seems like more work, but might be worth it if the caller
    then appends some stuff to the result.  But this close to 1.6,
    I'm inclined to do the simplest fix possible.
    
    Fixes #14232
