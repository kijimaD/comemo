    go_spec: use PrimaryExpr as type switch expression
    
    Without this change, the spec parses <-c.(type) as (<-c).(type)
    but parses <-c.(int) as <-(c.(int)).
    
    With this change, the former parses as <-(c.(type)).
    
    All three parsers already implement this rule, because
    they look for the "type" word during parsing of a standard
    type assertion.  This change merely brings the
    spec in line with the implementations.
