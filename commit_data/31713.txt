    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: start line offset (column) numbers at 1
    
    We could leave it alone and fix line offset (column) numbers when
    reporting errors, but that is likely to cause confusion (internal
    numbers don't match reported numbers). Instead, switch to default
    numbering starting at 1.
    
    For package syntax-internal use only, introduced constants defining
    the line and column bases, and use them throughout the code and its
    tests. It is possible to change these constants and package syntax
    will continue to work. But changing them is going to break any client
    that makes explicit assumptions about line and column numbers (which
    is "all of them").
