    net/http/httputil: add docs about X-Forwarded-For in ReverseProxy
    
    ReverseProxy automatically sets the X-Forwarded-For header, if the request
    already contains a X-Forwarded-For header, the value of the client IP is
    appended to the existing header value.
    This behavior isn't documented anywhere, and can lead to IP spoofing
    security issues is the client is untrusted (the most common situation).
    This PR documents this behavior.
    
    For future versions, I proposed #36678 that implements a more secure
    default behavior and adds support for other forwarded headers.
