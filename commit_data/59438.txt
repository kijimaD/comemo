    runtime: fix lost sleep causing TestZeroTimer flakes
    
    Classic operating system kernel mistake: if you start using
    per-CPU data without disabling interrupts on the CPU,
    and then an interrupt reschedules the process onto a different
    CPU, now you're using the wrong CPU's per-CPU data.
    The same thing happens in Go if you use per-M or per-P
    data structures while not holding a lock nor using acquirem.
    
    In the original timer.modify before CL 564977, I had been
    very careful about this during the "unlock t; lock ts" dance,
    only calling releasem after ts was locked. That made sure
    we used the right ts. The refactoring of that code into its
    own helper function in CL 564977 missed that nuance.
    
    The code
    
        ts := &getg().m.p.p.ptr().timers
        ts.lock()
    
    was now executing without holding any locks nor acquirem.
    If the goroutine changed its M or P between deciding which
    ts to use and actually locking that ts, the code would proceed
    to add the timer t to some other P's timers. If the P was idle
    by then, the scheduler could have already checked it for timers
    and not notice the newly added timer when deciding when the
    next timer should trigger.
    
    The solution is to do what the old code correctly did, namely
    acquirem before deciding which ts to use, rather than assume
    getg().m.p won't change before ts.lock can complete.
    This CL does that.
    
    Before CL 564977,
    
            stress ./time.test -test.run='ZeroTimer/impl=(func|cache)' -test.timeout=3m -test.count=20
    
    ran without failure for over an hour on my laptop.
    Starting in CL 564977, it consistently failed within a few minutes.
    After this CL, it now runs without failure for over an hour again.
    
    Fixes #66006.
