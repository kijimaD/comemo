    pkgbits: consolidate doc.go to only relevant details
    
    The stated goal for pkgbits is to implement encoding / decoding of
    primitives. However, pkgbits has knowledge of high-level details like
    elements, sections, and file layout.
    
    This change starts to clarify pkgbits by paring back documentation to
    only those concepts which pkgbits owns. Further CLs are needed to shift
    away logic that pkgbits should not own.
