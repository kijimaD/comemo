    doc: update FAQ on binary sizes
    
    In the binary sizes FAQ, the approximate size of a Go hello world
    binary was said to be 1.5MB (it was about 1.6MB on go1.7 on
    linux/amd64). Sadly, this is no longer true. A Go1.10 hello world is
    2.0MB, and in 1.11 it'll be about 2.5MB.
    
    Just say "a couple megabytes" to stop this dance.
