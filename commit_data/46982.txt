    syscall: clean up windows a bit
    
    The files being deleted contain no code.
    They exist because back when we used Makefiles
    that listed all the Go sources to be compiled, we wrote
    patterns like syscall_$GOOS_$GOARCH.go,
    and it was easier to create dummy empty files
    than introduce conditionals to not look for that
    file on Windows.
    
    Now that we have the go command instead,
    we don't need those dummy files.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
