    cmd/compile: don't walk field-name syntax in esc.go
    
    Walking the field name as if it were an expression
    caused a called to haspointers with a TFIELD, which panics.
    Trigger was a field at a large offset within a large struct,
    combined with a struct literal expression mentioning that
    field.
    
    Fixes #14405
