    cmd/compile/internal/test: update abi tests for recent spec changes
    
    The internal ABI spec was recently updated to include specific
    language covering "past-the-end" pointers and structs containing
    trailing zero-sized fields. Add a unit test that makes sure we do the
    right thing in this case. Fix a couple comments in other unit tests.
