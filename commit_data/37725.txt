    runtime: make traceback indicate whether _defer was just allocated
    
    Many of the crashes observed in #27993 involve committing the new
    _defer object at the end of newdefer. It would be helpful to know if
    the _defer was just allocated or was retrieved from the defer pool. In
    order to indicate this in the traceback, this CL duplicates the tail
    of newdefer so that the PC/line number will tell us whether d is new
    or not.
    
    For #27993.
