    io: simplify documentation for ByteReader
    
    Let C be whether c valid
    Let E be whether err is non-nil
    
    The old comment explicitly says that (~C → E). However, that does call
    into question whether (E → ~C), which causes doubts for users.
    Without a comment at all, it is obvious that only (E ↔ ~C) makes sense.
    
    Fixes #11308
