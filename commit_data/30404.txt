    cmd/go: fix TestIssue11457
    
    The goal of the test is to provoke a custom import path check error,
    which will contain the current repo path, to see that it says ssh:// in it.
    
    But the fix to #16471 made the test no longer provoke that error.
    Provoke the error by checking out from rsc.io instead of github.com/rsc.
    
    Fixes #17701.
