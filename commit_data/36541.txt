    fmt: add an example for Errorf
    
    The errors package has an example for Errorf, but the fmt
    package does not. Copy the Errorf example from errors to
    fmt. Move existing Stringer example into separate file, so as
    not to break the assumption that the entire file will be
    presented as the example.
