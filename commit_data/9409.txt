    test/chan/select5.go: change "with" to "if" in templatea
    
    I converted this program yesterday and the output is the
    same as it used to be, ignoring space, but the result is
    not the best expression of the algorithm.  The old {.section
    Maybe} pieces are now {{with .Maybe}}, as a direct translation,
    but I they should be {{if .Maybe}} as the output is just a
    bool and there is no cascading.
    
    I have verified that the output of the program is unaffected.
