commit 43618e62ca387faf2272308a46fed9378fa36a87
Author: Shenghou Ma <minux@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 22 16:27:59 2015 -0400

    log/syslog: make the BUG notes visible on golang.org
    
    It was only visible when you run godoc with explicit GOOS=windows,
    which is less useful for people developing portable application on
    non-windows platforms.
    
    Also added a note that log/syslog is not supported on NaCl.
