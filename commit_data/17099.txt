    cmd/gc: make bitmaps shorter
    
    Sort non-pointer-containing data to the low end of the
    stack frame, and make the bitmaps only cover the
    pointer-containing top end.
    
    Generates significantly less garbage collection bitmap
    for programs with large byte buffers on the stack.
    
    Only 2% shorter for godoc, but 99.99998% shorter
    in some test cases.
    
    Fixes arm build.
