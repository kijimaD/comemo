    cmd/go: support non-amd64 on script/toolexec.txt
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/263357, I wasn't thinking that the assembly
    file without a GOARCH suffix would be built for all architectures. Only
    build assembly for amd64, and update the stderr matching line.
    
    I manually verified that this works on 386; since the only Go file in
    that package is a stub, and no assembly files match GOARCH=386, no
    assembly is built at all.
