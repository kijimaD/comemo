    runtime: bias the pacer's cons/mark smoothing against noise
    
    Currently the pacer is designed to pace against the edge. Specifically,
    it tries to find the sweet spot at which there are zero assists, but
    simultaneously finishes each GC perfectly on time.
    
    This pretty much works, despite the noisiness of the measurement of the
    cons/mark ratio, which is central to the pacer's function. (And this
    noise is basically a given; the cons/mark ratio is used as a prediction
    under a steady-state assumption.) Typically, this means that the GC
    might assist a little bit more because it started the GC late, or it
    might execute more GC cycles because it started early. In many cases the
    magnitude of this variation is small.
    
    However, we can't possibly control for all sources of noise, especially
    since some noise can come from the underlying system. Furthermore, there
    are inputs to the measurement that have effectively no restrictions on
    how they vary, and the pacer needs to assume that they're essentially
    static when they might not be in some applications (i.e. goroutine
    stacks).
    
    The result of high noise is that the variation in when a GC starts is
    much higher, leading to a significant amount of assists in some GC
    cycles. While the GC cycle frequency basically averages out in the
    steady-state in the face of this variation, starting a GC late has the
    significant drawback of reducing application latencies.
    
    This CL thus biases the pacer toward avoiding assists by picking a
    cons/mark smoothing function that takes the maximum measured cons/mark
    over 5 cycles total. I picked 5 cycles because empirically this was the
    best trade-off between window size and smoothness for a uniformly
    distributed jitter in the cons/mark signal. The cost here is that if
    there's a significant phase change in the application that makes it less
    active with the GC, then we'll be using a stale cons/mark measurement
    for 5 cycles. I suspect this is fine precisely because this only happens
    when the application becomes less active, i.e. when latency matters
    less.
    
    Another good reason for this particular bias is that even though the GC
    might start earlier and end earlier on average, resulting in more
    frequent GC cycles and potentially worse throughput, it also means that
    it uses less memory used on average. As a result, there's a reasonable
    workaround in just turning GOGC up slightly to reduce GC cycle
    frequency and bringing memory (and hopefully throughput) levels back to
    the same baseline. Meanwhile, there should still be fewer assists than
    before which is just a clear improvement to latency.
    
    Lastly, this CL updates the GC pacer tests to capture this bias against
    assists and toward GC cycles starting earlier in the face of noise.
    
    Sweet benchmarks didn't show any meaningful difference, but real
    production applications showed a reduction in tail latencies of up
    to 45%.
    
    Updates #56966.
