    cmd/go/internal/modload: do not resolve an arbitrary version for 'go list --versions'
    
    If we don't actually require the listed module, we previously
    implicitly resolved "latest", but also (erroneously) forgot to apply
    exclusions and retractions for it. But there is really no need to
    resolve "latest" in this case at all â€” now we omit the version from
    the reported module info entirely.
    
    Fixes #44296
