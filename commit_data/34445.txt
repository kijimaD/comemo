    [release-branch.go1.9] runtime: in cpuProfile.addExtra, set p.lostExtra to 0 after flush
    
    After the number of lost extra events are written to the the cpuprof log,
    the number of lost extra events should be set to zero, or else, the next
    time time addExtra is logged, lostExtra will be overcounted. This change
    resets lostExtra after its value is written to the log.
    
    Fixes #21836
