    internal/trace: pass GOTRACEBACK=crash to testprogs
    
    The failures in #70310 are hard to decipher. The cases where the lock is
    being held either don't really make sense (the STW failures) or the
    goroutine that fails is 'running on another thread' and we don't get a
    stack trace. In fact, such a goroutine exists even in the STW cases.
    Since reproducing this is going to be hard (very few failures over a 2
    year span) let's set GOTRACEBACK=crash for these testprogs so next time
    it happens we can see why.
    
    For #70310.
