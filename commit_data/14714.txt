    encoding/xml: Marshal ",any" fields
    
    Fixes #3559.
    
    This makes Marshal handle fields marked ",any" instead of ignoring
    them. That makes Marshal more symmetrical with Unmarshal, which seems
    to have been a design goal.
    
    Note some test cases were changed, because this patch changes
    marshalling behavior. I think the previous behavior was buggy, but
    there's still a backward-compatibility question to consider.
