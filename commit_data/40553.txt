    crypto/x509: make '-gcflags=all=-d=checkptr' flag work
    
    Replace
    
    buf := [HUGE_CONST]*T)(unsafe.Pointer(p))[:]
    
    with
    
    buf := [HUGE_CONST]*T)(unsafe.Pointer(p))[:n:n]
    
    Pointer p points to n of T elements. New unsafe pointer conversion
    logic verifies that both first and last elements point into the
    same Go variable. And this change adjusts all code to comply with
    this rule.
    
    Verified by running
    
    go test -a -short -gcflags=all=-d=checkptr crypto/x509
    
    The test does not fail even with original version of this code. I
    suspect it is because all variables I changed live outside of Go
    memory. But I am just guessing, I don't really know how pointer
    checker works.
