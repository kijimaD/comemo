    cmd/go: make asm the first assembler
    
    verifyAsm is still on, but this CL changes the order to asm then 6a.
    Before, it was 6a then asm, but that meant that any bugs in asm
    for bad input would be prevented from happening because 6a would
    catch them. Now asm gets first crack, as it must.
    
    Also implement the -trimpath flag in asm. It's necessary and trivial.
