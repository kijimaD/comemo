    runtime/pprof: fix allFrames cache
    
    The compiler may choose to inline multiple layers of function call, such
    that A calling B calling C may end up with all of the instructions for B
    and C written as part of A's function body.
    
    Within that function body, some PCs will represent code from function A.
    Some will represent code from function B, and for each of those the
    runtime will have an instruction attributable to A that it can report as
    its caller. Others will represent code from function C, and for each of
    those the runtime will have an instruction attributable to B and an
    instruction attributable to A that it can report as callers.
    
    When a profiling signal arrives at an instruction in B (as inlined in A)
    that the runtime also uses to describe calls to C, the profileBuilder
    ends up with an incorrect cache of allFrames results. That PC should
    lead to a location record in the profile that represents the frames
    B<-A, but the allFrames cache's view should expand the PC only to the B
    frame.
    
    Otherwise, when a profiling signal arrives at an instruction in C (as
    inlined in B in A), the PC stack C,B,A can get expanded to the frames
    C,B<-A,A as follows: The inlining deck starts empty. The first tryAdd
    call proposes PC C and frames C, which the deck accepts. The second
    tryAdd call proposes PC B and, due to the incorrect caching, frames B,A.
    (A fresh call to allFrames with PC B would return the frame list B.) The
    deck accepts that PC and frames. The third tryAdd call proposes PC A and
    frames A. The deck rejects those because a call from A to A cannot
    possibly have been inlined. This results in a new location record in the
    profile representing the frames C<-B<-A (good), as called by A (bad).
    
    The bug is the cached expansion of PC B to frames B<-A. That mapping is
    only appropriate for the resulting protobuf-format profile. The cache
    needs to reflect the results of a call to allFrames, which expands the
    PC B to the single frame B.
    
    For #50996
    For #52693
    Fixes #52764
