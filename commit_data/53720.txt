    internal/fuzz: pass handle to temporary file instead of the path
    
    This CL partially reverts CL 297034. Inheritable handles are not
    inherited by all workers thanks to using AdditionalInheritedHandles,
    which explicitly specifies which handles to inherit by each worker.
    
    This CL doesn't fix any bug, it's more of a cleanup, but also makes
    the code more robust and more similar to its Unix counterpart.
