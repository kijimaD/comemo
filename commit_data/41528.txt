    [dev.link] cmd/link, cmd/internal/goobj2: adopt new DWARF compilation unit logic with new object file
    
    The dev.link branch was not sync'd with the new DWARF compilation
    unit logic change on the master branch, and the new object file
    format didn't support this.
    
    This CL adds the new DWARF CU and file table support to the new
    object file format. In the old object file, the DWARF file table
    is a separate section. For now, we do the same with the new
    object file, keeping it as a separate block.
    
    While here, also refactor the loader code so it is easier for the
    loader to carry per-object informations.
