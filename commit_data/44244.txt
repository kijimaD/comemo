    crypto/x509: document support for leading periods in DNS constraints
    
    This change adds a comment to the Verify documentation that indicates
    that you can use URI and email style name constraints with a leading
    period for DNS names (and explains what they do). This behavior is
    not standards compliant, but matches the community application of
    RFC 5280, so it makes sense to document it.
    
    Fixes #37535
