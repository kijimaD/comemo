    runtime: clean up mheap.allocLarge
    
    mheap.allocLarge just calls bestFitTreap and is the only caller of
    bestFitTreap. Flatten these into a single function. Also fix their
    comments: allocLarge claims to return exactly npages but can in fact
    return a larger span, and h.freelarge is not in fact indexed by span
    start address.
