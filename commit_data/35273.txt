    compress/gzip: skip builder-only test on iOS
    
    The new iOS test harness forwards environment variables to the
    test program, which means that it runs builder-only tests that were
    previously skipped because GO_BUILDER_NAME was missing.
    
    Skip one such unblocked test, TestGZIPFilesHaveZeroMTimes, which
    assumes a valid GOROOT.
