    cmd/vet: disable complaint about 0 flag in print
    
    The problem is that vet complains about 0 as a Printf flag in some
    situations where fmt allows it but probably shouldn't. The two
    need to be brought in line, but it's too late in the release cycle.
    
    The situation is messy and should be resolved properly in 1.11. This
    CL is a simple fix to disable a spurious complaint for 1.10 that will be
    resolved in a more thorough way in 1.11.
    
    The workaround is just to be silent about flag 0, as suggested in
    issue 23605.
    
    Fixes #23605
    Update #23498
