    sysycall: remove creds_linux_test.go
    It is unprecedented to add tests to package syscall, especially
    system-specific ones. Not a policy worth changing right before Go 1
    is cut.
    
    The sole existing test, passfd_test.go, contains the line
            // +build linux darwin probablyfreebsd probablyopenbsd
    which argues that this is not a subject to be undertaking likely.
    Note that passfd_test.go also went in just now. It's the only test
    in syscall.
    
    Deleting for now, will reconsider after Go 1.
