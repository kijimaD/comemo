    runtime: use correct heap goal in GC traces
    
    Currently gctrace and gcpacertrace recompute the heap goal for
    end-of-cycle information but this is incorrect.
    
    Because both of these traces are printing stats from the previous cycle
    in this case, they should print the heap goal at the end of the previous
    cycle.
