    cmd/compile: use 32-bit comparisons where possible on s390x
    
    We use 32-bit operations for 8- and 16-bit arithmetic, so use them
    for comparisons too. This won't change performance but it is more
    consistent and makes testing 8- and 16-bit comparison codegen
    slightly more straightforward (for follow up CL).
    
    Also fix a typo and add some additional double sign and zero
    extension rules to remove the operations inserted by the comparison
    rules.
