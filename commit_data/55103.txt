    internal/trace/v2: forward Event.Stack to StateTransition.Stack
    
    Currently StateTransition.Stack is only set for the GoCreate case,
    because there are two stacks and we need to distinguish them. But the
    docs for StateTransition.Stack say that that stack always references the
    resource that is transitioning. There are quite a few cases where
    Event.Stack is actually the appropriate stack to for
    StateTransition.Stack, but in these cases it's left empty, and the
    caller just needs to understand which one to look at. This isn't great.
    Forward Event.Stack to StateTransition.Stack whenever Event.Stack also
    refers to the resource experiencing the state transition.
