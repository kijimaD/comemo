    cmd/go/internal/modload: remove likely vestigial ability to infer module path from Godeps.json and vendor.json
    
    CL 518776 deleted the cmd/go/internal/modconv package and dropped the
    ability to import dependency requirements from ~nine or so legacy
    pre-module dependency configuration files. Part of the rationale from
    Russ in 2023 for dropping that support was that "by now no one is
    running into those configs anymore during 'go mod init'".
    
    For two of those legacy file formats, Godeps.json and vendor.json, the
    ability to import their listed dependencies was dropped in CL 518776,
    but what remained for those two formats was the ability to guess the
    resulting module name in the absence of a name being supplied to 'go mod
    init'.
    
    This could be explained by the fact that this smaller functionality for
    guessing a module name was separate, did not rely on the deleted modconv
    package, and instead only relied on simple JSON parsing.
    
    The name guessing was helpful as part of the transition when module
    support was initially released, but it was never perfect, including the
    various third-party dependency managers did not all have the same naming
    rules that were enforced by modules.
    
    In short, it is very unlikely anyone is relying on this now, so we
    delete it.
    
    This CL was spawned from discussion in two related documentation CLs
    (CL 662675 and CL 662695).
