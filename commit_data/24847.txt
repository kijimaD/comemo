    runtime: make SIGPROF skip stacks that are being copied
    
    sigprof tracebacks the stack across systemstack switches to make
    profile tracebacks more complete. However, it does this even if the
    user stack is currently being copied, which means it may be in an
    inconsistent state that will cause the traceback to panic.
    
    One specific way this can happen is during stack shrinking. Some
    goroutine blocks for STW, then enters gchelper, which then assists
    with root marking. If that root marking happens to pick the original
    goroutine and its stack needs to be shrunk, it will begin to copy that
    stack. During this copy, the stack is generally inconsistent and, in
    particular, the actual locations of the stack barriers and their
    recorded locations are temporarily out of sync. If a SIGPROF happens
    during this inconsistency, it will walk the stack all the way back to
    the blocked goroutine and panic when it fails to unwind the stack
    barriers.
    
    Fix this by disallowing jumping to the user stack during SIGPROF if
    that user stack is in the process of being copied.
    
    Fixes #12932.
