    cmd/distpack: remove more tools from packaged distribution
    
    The "doc", "fix", and "covdata" tools invoked by the go command are not
    needed for builds. Instead of invoking them directly using the installed
    binary in the tool directory, use "go tool" to run them, building them
    if needed. We can then stop distributing those tools in the
    distribution.
    
    covdata is used in tests and can form part of a cached test result, but
    test results don't have the same requirements as build outputs to be
    completely determined by the action id. We already don't include a
    toolid for the covdata tool in the action id for a test run. The more
    principled way to do things would be to load the covdata package,
    create the actions to build it, and then depend on the output of
    that action from the the test action and use that as the covdata tool.
    For now, it's probably not worth the effort, but, in the future, if we
    wanted to build a tool like cgo as needed, it would be best to build it
    in the same action graph. That would introduce a whole bunch of complexity
    because we'd need to build the tool in the host configuration, and all
    the configuration parameters are global.
    
    For #71867
