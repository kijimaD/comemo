    doc/install.html: streamline the “Test your installation” step and make it module-agnostic
    
    In CL 199417, we updated “How to Write Go Code” to give a basic
    introduction to modules and to include module-mode commands.
    However, most new users will end up reading “Getting Started”
    (doc/install.html) before “How to Write Go Code”, and we forgot to
    update the handful of commands there for module mode.
    
    Before this change, the “Test your installation” section also covered
    quite a few operations beoyond merely testing the installation: it
    included setting up a GOPATH, building a binary, and installing and
    cleaning binaries. Those are valuable operations to learn, but they
    arguably belong in “How to Write Go Code”, not “Test your
    installation” — and having all that extra detail in the install
    instructions may well discourage folks from further essential reading.
    
    Rather than updating all of those operations here, I've removed them.
    A companion CL will update “How to Write Go Code” to ensure that it
    mentions GOPATH (as the location of the module cache and the default
    install location for binaries) and 'go clean -i'.
