    codereview: fix clpatch with empty diffs
    
    Avoid passing the placeholder diff to hgpatch, so that
    clpatch-ing an empty diff grabs the metadata and warns
    about it being empty, rather than failing with a
    hard-to-debug problem ("mkdir: no such file or dir",
    no metadata, etc).
