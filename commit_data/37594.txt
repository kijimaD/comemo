    cmd/compile: mark memclrHasPointers calls as write barriers
    
    There are two places where the compiler generates memclrHasPointers
    calls. These are effectively write barriers, but the compiler doesn't
    currently record them as such in the function. As a result code like
    
      for i := range a {
        a[i] = nil
      }
    
    inserts a write barrier for the assignment to a[i], but the compiler
    doesn't report this. Hence, it's not reported in the -d=wb output, and
    it's not checked against //go:nowritebarrier annotations.
