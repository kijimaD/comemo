    doc: direct people to the mailing list
    
    Since the move to Github, we've started to receive lots of
    introductory questions to the bug tracker. I posit this is because
    most projects on Github don't have mailing lists, so the culture on
    Github is to use the Issue Tracker as a discussion forum.
    
    The Go project doesn't use the Issue Tracker as our first point of
    communication. This CL updates CONTRIBUTING.md (which is linked when
    you file a bug or send a pull request), to mention that we have a
    mailing list.
    
    It certainly won't stop all the errant bug reports, but it should
    help.
