    misc/android: adb push --sync testdata
    
    (A stripped down version of) $GOROOT is uploaded to the device
    before running standar library tests, including many (all?)
    testdata directories.
    
    Use the --sync flag when pushing testdata directories to the device
    in case it is already present.
