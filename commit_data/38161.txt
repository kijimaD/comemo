    runtime: revert "skip TestLldbPython when lldb is too old"
    
    This reverts commit d2170040617231a26ab0722d093ecb19e2ba8302.
    
    Reason for revert: It broke all the darwin builders; it's also not
    obvious how the weird darwin versions (900, 1000) relate to the > 3.9
    requisite, so I'm not sure how to decide about skipping in a robust
    way. It's better to revert the check for now.
    
    Fixes #28028
