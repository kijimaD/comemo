    runtime: refactor walking of bucket overflows
    
    This eliminates a nil check of b while evaluating b.tophash,
    which is in the inner loop of many hot map functions.
    It also makes the code a bit clearer.
    
    Also remove some gotos in favor of labeled breaks.
    
    On non-x86 architectures, this change introduces a pointless reg-reg move,
    although the cause is well-understood (#21572).
