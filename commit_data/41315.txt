    cmd/go: suppress errors in package-to-module queries if the package is already found
    
    In CL 173017, I changed the package-to-module query logic to query all
    possible module paths in parallel in order to reduce latency. (For
    long package paths, most such paths will not exist and will fail with
    little overhead.)
    
    The module resolution algorithm treats various kinds of non-existence
    as “soft errors”, to be reported only if package resolution fails, but
    treats any remaining errors as hard errors that should fail the query.
    
    Unfortunately, that interacted badly with the +incompatible version
    validation added in CL 181881, causing a regression in the 'direct'
    fetch path for modules using the “major branch” layout¹ with a post-v1
    version on the repository's default branch. Because we did not
    interpret a mismatched module path as “no such module”, a go.mod file
    specifying the path 'example.com/foo/v2' would cause the search for
    module 'example.com/foo' to error out. (That regression was not caught
    ahead of time due to a lack of test coverage for 'go get' on a package
    within a /vN module.)
    
    The promotion of hard errors during parallel search also made the 'go'
    command less tolerant of servers that advertise 'go-import' tags for
    nonexistent repositories. CL 194561 mitigated that problem for HTTP
    servers that return code 404 or 410 for a nonexistent repository, but
    unfortunately a few servers in common use (notably GitLab and
    pre-1.9.3 releases of Gitea) do not.
    
    This change mitigates both of those failure modes by ignoring
    “miscellaneous” errors from shorter module paths if the requested
    package pattern was successfully matched against a module with a
    longer path.
