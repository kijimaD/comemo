commit 3580ef9d64bdc0176cde032d170737a6e67ef8f2

    os/exec: on Windows, suppress ErrDot if the implicit path matches the explicit one
    
    If the current directory is also listed explicitly in %PATH%,
    this changes the behavior of LookPath to prefer the explicit name for it
    (and thereby avoid ErrDot).
    
    However, in order to avoid running a different executable from what
    would have been run by previous Go versions, we still return the
    implicit path (and ErrDot) if it refers to a different file entirely.
    
    Fixes #53536.
    Updates #43724.
