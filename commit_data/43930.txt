    runtime: make newproc1 not start the goroutine
    
    Currently, newproc1 allocates, initializes, and schedules a new
    goroutine. We're about to change debug call injection in a way that
    will need to create a new goroutine without immediately scheduling it.
    To prepare for that, make scheduling the responsibility of newproc1's
    caller. Currently, there's exactly one caller (newproc), so this
    simply shifts that responsibility.
    
    For #36365.
