    runtime: mark heapBits.bits nosplit
    
    heapBits.bits is used during bulkBarrierPreWrite via
    heapBits.isPointer, which means it must not be preempted. If it is
    preempted, several bad things can happen:
    
    1. This could allow a GC phase change, and the resulting shear between
    the barriers and the memory writes could result in a lost pointer.
    
    2. Since bulkBarrierPreWrite uses the P's local write barrier buffer,
    if it also migrates to a different P, it could try to append to the
    write barrier buffer concurrently with another write barrier. This can
    result in the buffer's next pointer skipping over its end pointer,
    which results in a buffer overflow that can corrupt arbitrary other
    fields in the Ps (or anything in the heap, really, but it'll probably
    crash from the corrupted P quickly).
    
    Fix this by marking heapBits.bits go:nosplit. This would be the
    perfect use for a recursive no-preempt annotation (#21314).
    
    This doesn't actually affect any binaries because this function was
    always inlined anyway. (I discovered it when I was modifying heapBits
    and make h.bits() no longer inline, which led to rampant crashes from
    problem 2 above.)
    
    Updates #22987 and #22988 (but doesn't fix because it doesn't actually
    change the generated code).
