    godoc: first cut at textual search
    
    To enable use -fulltext flag; e.g.: godoc -v -fulltext -http=:7777
    
    Enabling the fulltext index will use significantly more memory as
    the text of all source code, the respective suffixarray, and the
    file set data structure is kept in memory. At the moment there is
    about 6Mb of source code (~1400 files) indexed under GOROOT.
    Source code + suffix array together consume 5*(size of source) or
    about 30Mb. The file set data structure consumes about 4b/src line.
    By default only up to 5000 results are shown for now.
    
    The presentation of the results needs tuning. In particular,
    if a string is found, clicking on the respective file does not
    highlight them, yet.
    
    At the moment, only Go source files are indexed. Eventually,
    the full text index should encompass other files as well.
