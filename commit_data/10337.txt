    godefs: delete, replaced by cgo -godefs
    
    Godefs was a C program that ran gcc and then parsed the
    stabs debugging information in the resulting object file to
    generate C or Go code for bootstrapping as part of
    package runtime or package syscall.
    
    Cgo does the same work, but using the dwarf debugging
    information.  Add -godefs and -cdefs options to cgo that
    mimic godefs's output, albeit with different input
    (a Go program, not a C program).
    
    This has been a "nice to have" for a while but was forced
    by Apple removing stabs debugging output from their
    latest compilers.
    
    Fixes #835.
    Fixes #2338.
