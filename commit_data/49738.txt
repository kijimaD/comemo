    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: fix panic when marshaling data
    
    The coordinator needs to marshal data that was provided
    via f.Add. However, it was also attempting to marshal data
    that was in testdata, which was not needed,
    and was causing a panic. This change fixes this.
    
    Fixes golang/go#48228
