    misc/emacs: do not highlight built-in function if not followed by '('
    
    Name of built-in function is not reserved word in Go, and you can
    use it as variable name. "new" is often used as local variable, for
    instance.
    
    This patch is to apply font-lock-builtin-face only when built-in
    function name is followed by '(', so that it doesn't highlight
    non-function variable that happen to have the same name as built-in
    function.
