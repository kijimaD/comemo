    net: make proto and port lookups fall back to baked-in maps on Windows
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/28951 I cleaned up the lookupProtocol and
    lookupPort paths to be consistently case-insensitive across operating
    systems and to share the same baked-in maps of port & proto values
    that can be relied on to exist on any platform.
    
    I missed the fallback to the baked-in maps on Windows, though, which
    broke Windows XP. This should fix it.
    
    Fixes #17175
