commit a174987a7c137f3c76f30a32a5429a4060dcd4b2
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    two gopack nits.
    
    1. allocate an extra byte for use by write.
    2. throw away the code trying to translate
       uid and gid to names.  i suspect it of causing
       seg faults in some situations, and it is
       not needed by the compilers.
    
    Fixes #48.  (I hope.)
