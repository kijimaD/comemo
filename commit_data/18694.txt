    cmd/ld: fix misgenerated pcln file numbers
    
    The pcln file number was being encoded incorrectly. The recorded delta was always against -1, not against the previous value.
    
    Update #7369
    
    This CL fixes the bad DWARF file numbers. It does not, however, fix the gdb continue-to-end bug.
