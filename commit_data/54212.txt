    cmd/compile: remove ErrorfVers and base.Flag.Lang hack
    
    ErrorfVers used to be used by typecheck to report when new language
    functionality was used, but the -lang flag (from go.mod) was set to an
    older version. However, all of the callers have been since removed,
    now that this is handled by types2.
    
    And for the same reason, we can stop changing base.Flag.Lang. This was
    previously a workaround so that the unified frontend could generate
    arbitrary IR without upsetting typecheck, at a time when typecheck was
    itself a real frontend. Now it's just a glorified desugaring pass.
