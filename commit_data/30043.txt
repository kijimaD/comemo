    runtime: make mspan.isFree do what's on the tin
    
    Currently mspan.isFree technically returns whether the object was not
    allocated *during this cycle*. Fix it so it actually returns whether
    or not the object is allocated so the method is more generally useful
    (especially for debugging).
    
    It has one caller, which is carefully written to be insensitive to
    this distinction, but this lets us simplify this caller.
