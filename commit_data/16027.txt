    net/http: Transport: be paranoid about any non-100 1xx response
    
    Since we can't properly handle anything except 100, treat all
    1xx informational responses as sketchy and don't reuse the
    connection for future requests.
    
    The only other 1xx response code currently in use in the wild
    is WebSockets' use of "101 Switching Protocols", but our
    code.google.com/p/go.net/websockets doesn't use Client or
    Transport: it uses ReadResponse directly, so is unaffected by
    this CL.  (and its tests still pass)
    
    So this CL is entirely just future-proofing paranoia.
    Also: the Internet is weird.
