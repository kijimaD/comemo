    misc/cgo/testcarchive: use -no-pie where needed
    
    Starting in gcc 6, -pie is passed to the linker by default
    on some platforms, including ppc64le. If the objects
    being linked are not built for -pie then in some cases the
    executable could be in error. To avoid that problem, -no-pie
    should be used with gcc to override the default -pie option
    and generate a correct executable that can be run without error.
    
    Fixes #22126
