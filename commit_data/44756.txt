    cmd/go/internal/modload: remove go116EnableNarrowAll constant
    
    This constant existed in case there was a serious problem with the
    change to the "all" pattern in Go 1.16 (CL 240623), so that we could
    roll back the change in behavior by just flipping the constant without
    introducing merge conflicts elsewhere.
    
    Go 1.16 has been out for a while and the new "all" behavior seems fine,
    so we can jettison this feature flag.
    
    For #36460
