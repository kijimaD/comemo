    This simplifies the code and speeds it up.
    It also allows us to eliminate some other TODOs;
    those will come in a follow-up CL.
    
    Running for the host platform, before:
    
    real    0m9.907s
    user    0m14.566s
    sys     0m1.058s
    
    After:
    
    real    0m7.841s
    user    0m12.339s
    sys     0m0.572s
    
    Running for a single non-host platform, before:
    
    real    0m8.784s
    user    0m15.451s
    sys     0m3.445s
    
    After:
    
    real    0m7.681s
    user    0m12.122s
    sys     0m0.577s
    
    Running for all platforms, before:
    
    real    7m4.480s
    user    8m43.398s
    sys     1m15.683s
    
    After:
    
    real    4m37.596s
    user    7m30.729s
    sys     0m18.533s
    
    It also makes my laptop considerably more
    responsive while running for all platforms.
