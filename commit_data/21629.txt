    lib9: build tokenize on Plan 9
    
    The build was broken on Plan 9 after the
    CL 2994, because of the use of getfields
    in src/liblink/go.c.
    
    This happened when building 8l, because
    getfield was part of lib9 and tokenize
    was part of the Plan 9 libc. However,
    both getfields and tokenize depend on
    utfrune, causing an incompatibility.
    
    This change enables the build of tokenize
    as part of lib9, so it doesn't use
    tokenize from the Plan 9 libc anymore.
