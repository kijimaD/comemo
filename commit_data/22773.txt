    runtime: print stack of G during a signal
    
    Sequence of operations:
    - Go code does a systemstack call
    - during the systemstack call, receive a signal
    - signal requests a traceback of all goroutines
    
    The orignal G is still marked as _Grunning, so the traceback code
    refuses to print its stack.
    
    Fix by allowing traceback of Gs whose caller is on the same M as G is.
    G can't be modifying its stack if that is the case.
    
    Fixes #10546
