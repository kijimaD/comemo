    doc: update unsafe.Pointer rule in spec
    
    The valid conversions consider the core types of operands, not just
    their underlying type.
    
    This also explains the valid arguments for unsafe.Slice which are
    explained in terms of unsafe.Pointer conversions.
    
    unsafe.SliceData simply refers to "slice argument" and we use
    similar terminology elsewhere in the spec to denote values that
    have a core type of slice (or any other type for that matter).
    Leaving alone for now.
    
    Fixes #64452.
