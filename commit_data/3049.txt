commit 1f1551f17900ce992f1630f0603ceef1546dc655

    Test composite literals with undeclared types.  This crashed
    gccgo in a few different places, and crashes 6g as of this
    writing.  Note that the index in a composite literal must be
    looked up in a different namespace if the composite literal
    type turns out to be a struct.
