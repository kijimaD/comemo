    runtime: relax the threshold for TestPingPongHog
    
    The test checks that the scheduling of the goroutines are within
    a small factor, to ensure the scheduler handing off the P
    correctly. There have been flaky failures on the builder (probably
    due to OS scheduling delays). Increase the threshold to make it
    less flaky. The gap would be much bigger if the scheduler doesn't
    work correctly.
    
    For the long term maybe it is better to test it more directly
    with the scheduler, e.g. with scheduler instrumentation.
    
    May fix #52207.
