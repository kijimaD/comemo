    runtime: make the test addresses for pageAlloc smaller on 32-bit
    
    This change makes the test addresses start at 1 GiB instead of 2 GiB to
    support mips and mipsle, which only have 31-bit address spaces.
    
    It also changes some tests to use smaller offsets for the chunk index to
    avoid jumping too far ahead in the address space to support 31-bit
    address spaces. The tests don't require such large jumps for what
    they're testing anyway.
    
    Updates #35112.
    Fixes #35440.
