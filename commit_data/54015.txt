    cmd/internal/archive: skip sentinel archive entries created by Go cmd
    
    When reading an archive, check for the presence of sentinel entries
    created by the Go command. These zero-sized marker entries don't contain
    any useful symbols, but rather are there to communicate info to the
    linker; ignore them during symbol dumping.
    
    Fixes #62036.
