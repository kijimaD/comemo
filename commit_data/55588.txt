    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: factor out code generation for addition of 12 bit immediates
    
    Factor out and simplify code that generates the addition of a 12 bit immediate
    (the addition of a negative value is still handled via subtraction). This also
    fixes the mishandling of the case where v is 0.
