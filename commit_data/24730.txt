    runtime: move concurrent mark setup off system stack
    
    For historical reasons we currently do a lot of the concurrent mark
    setup on the system stack. In fact, at this point the one and only
    thing that needs to happen on the system stack is the start-the-world.
    
    Clean up this code by lifting everything other than the
    start-the-world off the system stack.
    
    The diff for this change looks large, but the only code change is to
    narrow the systemstack call. Everything else is re-indentation.
