    net: eliminate a deadlock on the failure path in TestNotTemporaryRead
    
    This fixes a deadlock-on-failure that I probably introduced in
    CL 385314.
    
    This doesn't explain why the failure observed in #52492 occurred, but
    it will at least give us more information to diagnose the failure if
    it happens again. (The deadlock currently prevents the t.Fatal log
    message from being written to the test's output.)
    
    Fixes #52492.
