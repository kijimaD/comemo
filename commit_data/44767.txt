    go/types: better error when converting untyped values in assignments
    
    The error returned by convertUntyped is 'cannot convert _ to _', which
    can be misleading in contexts where an explicit conversion would be
    allowed.
    
    Arguably the error message from convertUntyped should just be 'cannot
    use _ as _', as 'convert' has an explicit meaning within the spec.
    Making that change caused a large number of test failures, so for now we
    just fix this for assignments by interpreting the error.
    
    For #22070
