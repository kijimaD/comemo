    Revert "runtime: use semaphore structure for futex locks"
    
    This reverts commit dfb7073bb8e66630156fc14ae50042acef89a929 (CL 585636).
    
    Reason for revert: This is part of a patch series that changed the
    handling of contended lock2/unlock2 calls, reducing the maximum
    throughput of contended runtime.mutex values, and causing a performance
    regression on applications where that is (or became) the bottleneck.
