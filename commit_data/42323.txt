    encoding/json: properly encode strings with ",string" again
    
    golang.org/cl/193604 fixed one bug when one encodes a string with the
    ",string" option: if SetEscapeHTML(false) is used, we should not be
    using HTML escaping for the inner string encoding. The CL correctly
    fixed that.
    
    The CL also tried to speed up this edge case. By avoiding an entire new
    call to Marshal, the new Issue34127 benchmark reduced its time/op by
    45%, and lowered the allocs/op from 3 to 2.
    
    However, that last optimization wasn't correct:
    
            Since Go 1.2 every string can be marshaled to JSON without error
            even if it contains invalid UTF-8 byte sequences. Therefore
            there is no need to use Marshal again for the only reason of
            enclosing the string in double quotes.
    
    JSON string encoding isn't just about adding quotes and taking care of
    invalid UTF-8. We also need to escape some characters, like tabs and
    newlines.
    
    The new code failed to do that. The bug resulted in the added test case
    failing to roundtrip properly; before our fix here, we'd see an error:
    
            invalid use of ,string struct tag, trying to unmarshal "\"\b\f\n\r\t\"\\\"" into string
    
    If you pay close attention, you'll notice that the special characters
    like tab and newline are only encoded once, not twice. When decoding
    with the ",string" option, the outer string decode works, but the inner
    string decode fails, as we are now decoding a JSON string with unescaped
    special characters.
    
    The fix we apply here isn't to go back to Marshal, as that would
    re-introduce the bug with SetEscapeHTML(false). Instead, we can use a
    new encode state from the pool - it results in minimal performance
    impact, and even reduces allocs/op further. The performance impact seems
    fair, given that we need to check the entire string for characters that
    need to be escaped.

    Instead of adding another standalone test, we convert an existing
    "string tag" test to be table-based, and add another test case there.
    
    One test case from the original CL also had to be amended, due to the
    same problem - when escaping '<' due to SetEscapeHTML(true), we need to
    end up with double escaping, since we're using ",string".
    
    Fixes #38173.
