    runtime: reset scavenge address in scavengeAll
    
    Currently scavengeAll (which is called by debug.FreeOSMemory) doesn't
    reset the scavenge address before scavenging, meaning it could miss
    large portions of the heap. Fix this by reseting the address before
    scavenging, which will ensure it is able to walk over the entire heap.
    
    Fixes #35858.
