    cmd/compile: remove FS debug hash form
    
    The FS form was only necessary for reliable hashes in tests,
    and for that we can use -trimpath.
    
    Another potential concern would be temporary work directory
    names leaking into the names of files generated by cgo and the
    like, but we already make sure to avoid those to ensure
    reproducible builds: the compiler never sees those paths.
    So the FS form is not necessary for that either.
