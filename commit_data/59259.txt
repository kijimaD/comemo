    runtime: delete clearDeletedTimers
    
    adjusttimers already contains the same logic. Use it instead.
    This avoids having two copies of the code and is faster.
    
    adjusttimers was formerly O(n log n) but is now O(n).
    clearDeletedTimers was formerly O(nÂ² log n) and is now gone!
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
