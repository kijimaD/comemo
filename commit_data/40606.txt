    doc: mention the anti-spam bypass in security.html
    
    We had some issues with reports being marked as spam, so I added a
    filter to never mark as spam something that mentions the word
    "vulnerability". We get too much spam at that address to disable the
    filter entirely, so instead meantion the bypass in the docs.
