    cmd/compile: add explicit 'where' to EscStep data for explanations
    
    Sometimes neither the src nor the dst of an escape edge
    contains the line number appropriate to the edge, so add
    a field so that can be set correctly.
    
    Also updated some of the explanations to be less jargon-y
    and perhaps more informative, and folded bug example into
    test.
    
    Cleaned up some of the function/method names in esc.go
    and did a quick sanity check that each "bundling" function
    was actually called often enough to justify its existence.
    
    Fixes #17459.
