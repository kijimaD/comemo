    cmd/dist,cmd/compile: remove -allabis mode
    
    dist passes the -allabis flag to the compiler to avoid having to
    recreate the cross-package ABI logic from cmd/go. However, we removed
    that logic from cmd/go in CL 179863 and replaced it with a different
    mechanism that doesn't depend on the build system. Hence, passing
    -allabis in dist is no longer necessary.
    
    This CL removes -allabis from dist and, since that was the only use of
    it, removes support for it from the compiler as well.
    
    Updates #31230.
