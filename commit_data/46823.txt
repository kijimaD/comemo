    cmd/link: put gcprog symbols along with gcbits
    
    A stack object record may refer to the object's type's GC mask or
    GC program (for very large types). For the latter, currently the GC
    program symbol is named "type..gcprog.XXX" which is then laid out
    along with type symbols at link time. When relro is used, the type
    symbols end up in a different section.
    
    As we now use relative addressing for stack object records to refer
    to GC masks or GC programs, it is important that it is laid out in
    the rodata section (not rodata.rel.ro). Move GC program symbols to
    be along with GC masks, as they are similar and accessed the same
    way. They don't have relocations so they don't need to be laid to a
    relro section.
    
    This fixes flaky failures like
