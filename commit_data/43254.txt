    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: provide BadExpr where needed, call correct error handler
    
    - For "if" statements without a condition, provide a BadExpr rather than nil
      (clients expect IfStmt.Cond != nil since the parser is taking care of
      reporting a missing condition).
    
    - For 3-index slice expressions, also provide BadExpr where an index is
      required but missing.
    
    - Declare a parser-local error method to hide the embedded error method
      so we don't use it by mistake.
    
    Accidentally found while adjusting prototype parser to work for generics.
