commit cfb94254608e8aa83ca589d5cc30dd3d3c64ff26
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    emit dynamically linked 6.out on darwin instead of static,
    unless given -d flag.
    
    the resulting binary doesn't *use* any dynamic libraries,
    it just has a reference to the dynamic linker and an
    empty list of needed symbols and libraries.
    
    this is enough to make 6.out binaries that can be run
    under dtrace / dtruss.
