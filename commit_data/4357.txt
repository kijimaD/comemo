commit 3ca1b1d27f6bd72dac74ba9e696c002998e54ec5

    Continuation of issue 221 fix. When 8g or 6g or 5g are called with a
    UTF-8 string, Yconv() converts it into an octal sequence. If the
    string converted to more than 30 bytes, the str buffer would
    overflow. For example, 4 Greek runes became 32 bytes, 3 Hiragana
    runes became 36 bytes, and 2 Gothic runes became 32 bytes. In
    8l, 6l and 5l the function is Sconv(). For some reason, only 5l uses
    the constant STRINGSZ (defined as 200) for the buffer size.
