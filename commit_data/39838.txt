    cmd/dist: set GOPATH to internal directory during build
    
    Since GO111MODULE=on by default, the Go command needs a location for
    the module cache, even though it doesn't need to be written when
    building std and cmd. If GOROOT is checked out to $HOME/go, which is
    also the default location for GOPATH, this causes unnecessary problems
    late in the build.
    
    With this change, dist sets GOPATH to $GOROOT/pkg/obj/go-path. This is
    next to the temporary GOCACHE, $GOROOT/pkg/obj/go-build.
    
    Fixes #30960
