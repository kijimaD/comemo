    runtime: avoid arm64 8.1 atomics on Android
    
    The kernel on some Samsung S9+ models reports support for arm64 8.1
    atomics, but in reality only some of the cores support them. Go
    programs scheduled to cores without support will crash with SIGILL.
    
    This change unconditionally disables the optimization on Android.
    A better fix is to precisely detect the offending chipset.
    
    Fixes #28431
