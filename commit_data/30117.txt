    image: fix the overlap check in Rectangle.Intersect.
    
    The doc comment for Rectangle.Intersect clearly states, "If the two
    rectangles do not overlap then the zero rectangle will be returned."
    Prior to this fix, calling Intersect on adjacent but non-overlapping
    rectangles would return an empty but non-zero rectangle.
    
    The fix essentially changes
    if r.Min.X > r.Max.X || r.Min.Y > r.Max.Y { etc }
    to
    if r.Min.X >= r.Max.X || r.Min.Y >= r.Max.Y { etc }
    (note that the > signs have become >= signs), but changing that line to:
    if r.Empty() { etc }
    seems clearer (and equivalent).
