    cmd/go: make sure linker -o for plugin doesn't include tempdir path
    
    There is already a case that when buildmode=shared passes only the
    basename of the -o argument to the link command to the linker (and
    runs in the directory of that argument) to avoid having that
    (temporary) directory of the file be included in the LC_ID_DYLIB load
    command. Extend the case to buildmode=plugin, because the same thing
    can happen there.
    
    This can only happen on darwin: the -o command can be embedded into
    Mach-O and PE binaries, but plugin isn't supported on Windows.
    
    For #58557
