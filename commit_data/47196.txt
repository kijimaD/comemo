    cmd/asm: disable scaled register format for arm64
    
    Arm64 doesn't have scaled register format, such as (R1*2), (R1)(R2*3),
    but currently the assembler doesn't report an error for such kind of
    instruction operand format. This CL disables the scaled register
    operand format for arm64 and reports an error if this kind of instruction
    format is seen.
    With this CL, the assembler won't print (R1)(R2) as (R1)(R2*1), so that
    we can make the assembly test simpler.
