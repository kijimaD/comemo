    [dev.power64] runtime: fix gcinfo_test on power64x
    
    The GC info masks for slices and strings were changed in
    commit caab29a25f68, but the reference masks used by
    gcinfo_test for power64x hadn't caught up.  Now they're
    identical to amd64, so this CL fixes this test by combining
    the reference masks for these platforms.
