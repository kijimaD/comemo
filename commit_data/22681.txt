    runtime: benchmark for ping-pong in the presence of a CPU hog
    
    This benchmark demonstrates a current problem with the scheduler where
    a set of frequently communicating goroutines get very little CPU time
    in the presence of another goroutine that hogs that CPU, even if one
    of those communicating goroutines is always runnable.
    
    Currently it takes about 0.5 milliseconds to switch between
    ping-ponging goroutines in the presence of a CPU hog:
