    runtime: remove checkgc code from hashmap
    
    Currently hashmap is riddled with code that attempts to force a GC on
    the next allocation if checkgc is set. This no longer works as
    originally intended with the concurrent collector, and is apparently
    no longer used anyway.
    
    Remove checkgc.
