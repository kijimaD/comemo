    cmd/compile: refactor out an almost-superfluous arg
    
    Moved all "target" information into "storeRC"; it was a register
    cursor, now it is a register cursor that also carries the store
    target with it if there are no registers.  Also allows booby-trapping
    to ensure that the target is unambiguously one or the other.
    
    For #40724.
