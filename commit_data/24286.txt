    runtime: preserve R11 in darwin/arm entrypoint
    
    The _rt0_arm_darwin_lib entrypoint has to conform to the darwin ARMv7
    calling convention, which requires functions to preserve the value of
    R11. Go uses R11 as the liblink REGTMP register, so save it manually.
    
    Also avoid using R4, which is also callee-save.
    
    Fixes #12590
