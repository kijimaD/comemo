    net/http: avoid a bunch of unnecessary CanonicalHeaderKey calls
    
    CanonicalHeaderKey didn't allocate, but it did use unnecessary
    CPU in the hot path, deciding it didn't need to allocate.
    
    I considered using constants for all these common header keys
    but I didn't think it would be prettier. "Content-Length" looks
    better than contentLength or hdrContentLength, etc.
