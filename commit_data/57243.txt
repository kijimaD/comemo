    runtime: check global runq during "delicate dance"
    
    When a thread transitions to spinning to non-spinning it must recheck
    all sources of work because other threads may submit new work but skip
    wakep because they see a spinning thread.
    
    However, since the beginning of time (CL 7314062) we do not check the
    global run queue, only the local per-P run queues.
    
    The global run queue is checked just above the spinning checks while
    dropping the P. I am unsure what the purpose of this check is. It
    appears to simply be opportunistic since sched.lock is already held
    there in order to drop the P. It is not sufficient to synchronize with
    threads adding work because it occurs before decrementing
    sched.nmspinning, which is what threads us to decide to wake a thread.
    
    Resolve this by adding an explicit global run queue check alongside the
    local per-P run queue checks.
    
    Almost nothing happens between dropped sched.lock after dropping the P
    and relocking sched.lock: just clearing mp.spinning and decrementing
    sched.nmspinning. Thus it may be better to just hold sched.lock for this
    entire period, but this is a larger change that I would prefer to avoid
    in the freeze and backports.
    
    For #55160.
