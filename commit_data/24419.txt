    test: don't run issue10607.go on ppc64
    
    This is a reprise of https://golang.org/cl/12623.  In that a CL I made
    a suggestion which forgot that the +build constraints in the test
    directory are not the same as those supported by the go tool: in the
    test directory, if a single +build line fails, the test is skipped.
    (In my defense, the code I was commenting on was also wrong.)
