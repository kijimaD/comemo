    test: fix ABI mismatch in fixedbugs/issue19507
    
    Because run.go doesn't pass the package being compiled to the compiler
    via the -p flag, it can't match up the main·f symbol from the
    assembler with the "func f" stub in Go, so it doesn't produce the
    correct assembly stub.
    
    Fix this by removing the package prefix from the assembly definition.
    
    Alternatively, we could make run.go pass -p to the compiler, but it's
    nicer to remove these package prefixes anyway.
    
    Should fix the linux-arm builder, which was broken by the introduction
    of function ABIs in CL 147160.
    
    Updates #27539.
