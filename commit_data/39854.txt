    crypto/x509: look for CAs at /etc/ssl/cert.pem for Alpine Linux
    
    Alpine Linux uses /etc/ssl/cert.pem as default ca-bundle which
    is preinstalled since 3.7 and was installed as part of the libressl
    package in 3.5 and 3.6.
    
    The path /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt is only valid if the full
    ca-certificates package is installed by hand, which contains all
    single CA certs and uses update-ca-certificates to bundle them.
    
    The priority for /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt should be kept
    higher than /etc/ssl/cert.pem in case the user installed custom
    CA certs.
