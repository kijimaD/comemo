    cmd/compile: disable flaky test
    
    The test is inherently racy and vulnerable to starvation,
    and within all.bash on some platforms that means it flakes.
    Test is kept because it can be useful standalone to verify
    behavior of GOEXPERIMENT=preeemptibleloops, and there is
    likely to be further development of this feature in the
    future.
    
    There's also some question as to why it is flaking, because
    though technically this is permitted, it's very odd in this
    simple case.
    
    Fixes #18589.
