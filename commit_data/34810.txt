    cmd/go: implement go clean -testcache
    
    Ian suggested that since test caching is not expected to be perfect
    in all cases, we should allow users to clear the test cache separately
    from clearing the entire build cache.
    
    This CL adds 'go clean -testcache' to do that. The implementation
    does not actually delete files (for that, use 'go clean -cache').
    Instead, it writes down the current time, and future go tests will
    ignore any cached test results written before that time.
