    cmd/compile: in prove, simplify logic of branch pushing
    
    prove used a complex logic when trying to prove branch conditions:
    tryPushBranch() was sometimes leaving a checkpoint on the factsTable,
    sometimes not, and the caller was supposed to check the return value
    to know what to do.
    
    Since we're going to make the prove descend logic a little bit more
    complex by adding also induction variables, simplify the tryPushBranch
    logic, by removing any factsTable checkpoint handling from it.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
