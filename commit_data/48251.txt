    cmd/link: don't generate typedef DWARF entry for noalg.struct{...}
    
    cmd/compile uses "noalg.struct {...}" as type name when hash and eq algorithm generation of this struct type is suppressed. This should be treated as normal struct type, that is, link shouldn't generate DW_TAG_typedef DIE for it.
