    cmd/compile: remove bug workarounds in prove's loop inversion
    
    I wrote theses checks because I got bad panics on some innocent functions,
    turns out I was working around #63955 but I was not aware of that at the time.
    
    The proper fix was included in CL 539977 this is now doing nothing.
