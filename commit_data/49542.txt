    cmd/link: link against libsynchronization.a for -race on windows
    
    As of LLVM rev 41cb504b7c4b18ac15830107431a0c1eec73a6b2, the
    race detector runtime now refers to things in the windows
    synchronization library, hence when doing windows internal
    linking, at that library to the list of host archives that
    we visit. The tsan code that makes the reference is here:
    
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/41cb504b7c4b18ac15830107431a0c1eec73a6b2/compiler-rt/lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_win.cpp#L48
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/41cb504b7c4b18ac15830107431a0c1eec73a6b2/compiler-rt/lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_win.cpp#L834
    
    Note that libsynchronization.a is not guaranteed to be available on
    all windows systems, so in the external linking case, check for its
    existence before adding "-lsynchronization" to the external linker
    args.
    
    Updates #53539.
