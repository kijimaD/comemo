    [dev.regabi] go/types: consistently report nil type as "untyped nil"
    
    This is a port of CL 284052 to go/types. The port is not entirely
    faithful, as untyped conversion has been refactored in go/types.
    Additionally, a comment was added to reference issue #13061 in the
    implicitType method.
    
    For #13061
