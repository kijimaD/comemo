    cmd/compile: remove -installsuffix flag
    
    Obsoleted by -importcfg.
    
    cmd/link has a similar flag, but it seems to still be needed at least
    for misc/cgo/testshared.TestGopathShlib. I can't immediately tell why
    (has something to do with finding .so files), but it doesn't appear to
    possibly affect cmd/compile.
    
    Updates #51225.
