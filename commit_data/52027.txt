    cmd/go: update TestCgoHandlesWlORIGIN to avoid -rpath on windows
    
    Tweak the cgo recipe for the TestCgoHandlesWlORIGIN testpoint to avoid
    using "-rpath" on Windows, where it doesn't make sense to use it. This
    change needed to avoid an "unknown flag -rpath" from clang/ldd on
    windows.
    
    Updates #35006.
