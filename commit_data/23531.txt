    cmd/internal/obj: remove F3t field from Prog
    
    F3t was effectively a local variable.
    Remove it.
    
    This shrinks obj.Prog from 456 to 448 bytes,
    which places it in a smaller malloc class.
    
    This reduces the memory usage of the compiler
    while compiling the rotate tests by ~2.75%.
