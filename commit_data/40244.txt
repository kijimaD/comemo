    runtime: initialise cpu.HWCap on openbsd/arm64
    
    OpenBSD does not provide auxv, however we still need to initialise cpu.HWCap.
    For now initialise it to the bare minimum, until some form of CPU capability
    detection is implemented or becomes available - see issue #31746.
    
    Updates #31656
