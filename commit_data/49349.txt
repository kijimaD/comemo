    test/heapsampling.go: slow down allocation rate and reduce iterations
    
    As far as I can tell, this test suffers from #52433. For some reason,
    this seems to become more of a problem on the windows/386 than anywhere
    else. This CL is an attempt at a mitigation by slowing down the
    allocation rate by inserting runtime.Gosched call in the inner loop. It
    also cuts the iteration count which should help too (as less memory is
    allocated in total), but the main motivation is to make sure the test
    doesn't take too long to run.
    
    Fixes #49564.
