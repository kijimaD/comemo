    [dev.link] cmd/link: rework line table generation to reduce heap mem
    
    Rework the way symbols are handled in DWARF line table generation to
    eliminate copying the data payload for all SWDWARFLINES syms (emitted
    by the compiler) into the payload of the ".debug_line" section symbol
    (generated by the linker). Instead, chain together the SWDWARFLINES
    symbols into a list, then append that list to the section sym list in
    dwarfp (this moves us from a single monolithic .debug_line to a
    .debug_line section sym followed by a list symbols (one per function
    and an epilog symbol per compilation unit). To enable this work, move
    the emission of the DW_LNE_set_address op (at the start of each
    function) from the linker to the compiler.
