    cmd/link: set SizeOfRawData rather than VirtualSize in COFF files for .bss section
    
    GCC and Clang both set the SizeOfRawData field rather than the
    VirtualSize field for communicating the size of the .bss section. As a
    consequence, LLD does not look at VirtualSize and collapses the .bss
    section into whatever is around it, resulting in runtime crashes. This
    commit changes the logic so that if the requested "file size" is 0, then
    the SizeOfRawData field is set rather than the VirtualSize field as the
    sole length marker.
