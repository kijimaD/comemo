    fmt: treat \r\n as \n in Scan
    When scanning input and "white space" is permitted, a carriage return
    followed immediately by a newline (\r\n) is treated exactly the same
    as a plain newline (\n). I hope this makes it work better on Windows.
    
    We do it everywhere, not just on Windows, since why not?
    
    Fixes #5391.
