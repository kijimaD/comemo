    go/build: omit PkgObj for packages "unsafe" and "builtin"
    
    Package "builtin" is not a real, importable package; it exists only
    for documentation. Package "unsafe" is not compiled into an object
    file from its source code; instead, imports of "unsafe" are handled
    specially by the compiler.
    
    (In Go 1.19.3, package "unsafe" did not have an install target, while
    package "builtin" did but that target was never written.)
    
    Fixes #56687.
    Updates #47257.
