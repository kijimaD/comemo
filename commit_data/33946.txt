    runtime: make nextFreeFast inlinable
    
    https://golang.org/cl/22598 made nextFreeFast inlinable.
    But during https://golang.org/cl/63611 it was discovered, that it is no longer inlinable.
    Reduce number of statements below inlining threshold to make it inlinable again.
    Also update tests, to prevent regressions.
    Doesn't reduce readability.
