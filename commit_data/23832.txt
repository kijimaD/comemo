    cmd/link: when reading symbols from a shared library, allow duplicates when they are both in bss
    
    This makes the behaviour match what happens when duplicate symbols are read
    from regular object files and fixes errors about cgoAlwaysFalse when linking
    an executable that uses cgo against a shared library.
