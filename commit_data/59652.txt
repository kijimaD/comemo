    crypto/tls: enable BoGo DisabledCurve-HelloRetryRequest-TLS13
    
    The crypto/tls package produces the expected error for this test case,
    and so it can be enabled.
    
    Looking at the history of the relevant code it appears the TLS 1.3
    implementation has always had the correct behaviour for HRR changing to
    an unsupported group after the initial hello.
    
    I think this test was skipped initially because at the time of
    initial BoGo config commit we hadn't implemented the -curves argument
    for the test shim yet, and this test relies on it. We later added
    support for that flag alongside X25519Kyber768Draft00 KX and I think we
    missed the chance to enable the test then.
    
    Updates #72006
