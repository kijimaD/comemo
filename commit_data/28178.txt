    crypto/cipher: enforce message size limits for GCM.
    
    The maximum input plaintext for GCM is 64GiB - 64. Since the GCM
    interface is one-shot, it's very hard to hit this in Go (one would need
    a 64GiB buffer in memory), but we should still enforce this limit.
    
    Thanks to Quan Nguyen for pointing it out.
