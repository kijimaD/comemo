    cmd/dist: force non-devel version for cross-build buildlets
    
    If the compiler has a non-devel version it will report that version
    to the go command for use as the "compiler ID" instead of using
    the content ID of the binary. This in turn allows the go command
    to see the compiled-for-amd64 arm compiler and the compiled-for-arm
    arm compiler as having the same ID, so that packages cross-compiled
    from amd64 look up-to-date when copied to the arm system
    during the linux-arm buildlets and trybots.
