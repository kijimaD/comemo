    cmd/go: fix processing of HTTPS 404 without -insecure
    
    The change here is to move the closeBody call into the if block.
    The logging adjustments are just arranging to tell the truth:
    in particular if we're not in insecure mode and we get a non-200
    error then we do not actually ignore the response
    (except as caused by closing the body incorrectly).
    
    As the comment below the change indicates, it is intentional that
    we process non-200 pages. The code does process them, because
    the if err != nil || status != 200 block does not return.
    But that block does close the body, which depending on timing
    can apparently poison the later read from the body.
    
    See #13037's initial report:
    
            $ go get -v bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache
            Fetching https://bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache?go-get=1
            ignoring https fetch with status code 404
            Parsing meta tags from https://bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache?go-get=1 (status code 404)
            import "bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache": parsing bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache: http: read on closed response body
            package bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache: unrecognized import path "bosun.org/cmd/bosun/cache"
    
    The log print about ignoring the https fetch is not strictly true,
    since the next thing that happened was parsing the body of that fetch.
    But the read on the closed response body failed during parsing.
    
    Moving the closeBody to happen only when we're about to discard the
    result and start over (that is, only in -insecure mode) fixes the parse.
    
    At least it should fix the parse. I can't seem to break the parse anymore,
    because of #13648 (close not barring future reads anymore),
    but this way is clearly better than the old way. If nothing else the old code
    closed the body twice when err != nil and -insecure was not given.
    
    Fixes #13037.
