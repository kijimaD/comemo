commit e6600ea17d33fecd4e6cc26a97cdcc187ccbdb51
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    fmt.Scan:
    - reimplement integer scanning to handle renamed basic integer types
    - start implementation of Fscanf and Scanf; not yet ready for general use.
    
    This intermediate CL is a useful checkpoint. A similar change needs to be
    done for float and complex, but it seemed worth getting the approach
    reviewed before making those changes.
