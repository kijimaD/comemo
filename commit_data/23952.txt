    net/http: bound the number of bytes read seeking EOF in Handler's Body.Close
    
    If a client sent a POST with a huge request body, calling
    req.Body.Close in the handler (which is implicit at the end of a
    request) would end up consuming it all.
    
    Put a cap on that, using the same threshold used elsewhere for similar
    cases.
    
    Fixes #9662
