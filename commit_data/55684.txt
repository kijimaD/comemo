    net/http: make FileServer look good on mobile
    
    Currently when viewing directories on a phone, the text is small and
    often hard to tap correctly.  This commit adds the viewport property to
    the page to make it look correct on phones.  This commit also makes the
    page behave in Standards Mode instead of Quirks Mode which does not
    effect the behavior of this page but makes me feel good inside ‚ò∫Ô∏è
