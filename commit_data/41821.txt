    internal/syscall/windows: change WSAMsg.Name type
    
    The problem was discovered while running
    
    go test -a -short -gcflags=all=-d=checkptr -run=TestUDPConnSpecificMethods net
    
    WSAMsg is type defined by Windows. And WSAMsg.Name could point to two
    different structures for IPv4 and IPV6 sockets.
    
    Currently WSAMsg.Name is declared as *syscall.RawSockaddrAny. But that
    violates
    
    (1) Conversion of a *T1 to Pointer to *T2.
    
    rule of
    
    https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer
    
    When we convert *syscall.RawSockaddrInet4 into *syscall.RawSockaddrAny,
    syscall.RawSockaddrInet4 and syscall.RawSockaddrAny do not share an
    equivalent memory layout.
    
    Same for *syscall.SockaddrInet6 into *syscall.RawSockaddrAny.
    
    This CL changes WSAMsg.Name type to *syscall.Pointer. syscall.Pointer
    length is 0, and that at least makes type checker happy.
    
    After this change I was able to run
    
    go test -a -short -gcflags=all=-d=checkptr std cmd
    
    without type checker complaining.
    
    Updates #34972
