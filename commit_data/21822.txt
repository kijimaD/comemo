    test: check for build constraints only upto the first blank line
    
    The main issue is that the misc/cgo/{stdio,life} tests are silently
    getting skipped when invoked from run.bash.
    
    run.go should ignore any build tags after the first blank line in
    source file. It already checks for test actions only upto the first
    blank line. Build tags must be specified in the same block.
    
    See http://golang.org/cl/3675 for background.
