    cmd, runtime: mark assembly routines in FuncFlags
    
    There's no good way to ascertain at runtime whether
    a function was implemented in assembly.
    The existing workaround doesn't play nicely
    with some upcoming linker changes.
    
    This change introduces an explicit marker for routines
    implemented in assembly.
    
    This change doesn't use the new bit anywhere,
    it only introduces it.
