    runtime: use BX instead of R15 in race detector
    
    If the race detector were runnable in dynamic linking mode,
    then R15 would get clobbered. I don't think it is, so maybe
    not a problem, but can't hurt to clean it up.
    
    It also lets CL 283474 pass cleanly when checking the whole stdlib
    (together with CL 288452).
