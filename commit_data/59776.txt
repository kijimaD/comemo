    runtime: clarify stack traces for bubbled goroutines
    
    Use the synctest bubble ID to identify bubbles in traces,
    rather than the goroutine ID of the bubble's root goroutine.
    
    Some waitReasons include a "(synctest)" suffix to distinguish
    a durably blocking state from a non-durable one. For example,
    "chan send" vs. "chan send (synctest)". Change this suffix
    to "(durable)".
    
    Always print a "(durable)" sufix for the state of durably
    blocked bubbled goroutines. For example, print "sleep (durable)".
    
    Drop the "[not] durably blocked" text from goroutine states,
    since this is now entirely redundant with the waitReason.
    
    Old:
      goroutine 8 [chan receive (synctest), synctest bubble 7, durably blocked]:
      goroutine 9 [select (no cases), synctest bubble 7, durably blocked]:
    
    New:
      goroutine 8 [chan receive (durable), synctest bubble 1]:
      goroutine 9 [select (no cases) (durable), synctest bubble 1]:
