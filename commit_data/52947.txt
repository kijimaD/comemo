    sync: add more notes about Cond behavior
    
    Cond is difficult to use correctly (I was just bitten by it in
    a production app that I inherited). While several proposals have come
    up to improve or remove sync.Cond, no action has so far been taken.
    
    Update the documentation to discourage use of sync.Cond, and point
    people in the direction of preferred alternatives. I believe this will
    help encourage behavior we want (less use of sync.Cond and more use of
    channels), while also paving the way for, potentially, removing Cond
    in a future version of the language.
    
    Thanks very much to Bryan Mills and Sean Liao for discussion and
    recommendations.
    
    Updates #20491.
    Updates #21165.
