    misc/cgo: fix test on iOS
    
    The test in CL 123715 doesn't work on iOS, it needs to use a different
    version scheme to determine whether SecKeyAlgorithm and friends exist.
    Restrict the old version test to OSX only.
    
    The same problem occurs on iOS: the functions tested don't exist before
    iOS 10.  But we don't have builders below iOS 10, so it isn't a big issue.
    If we ever get older builders, or someone wants to run all.bash on an
    old iOS, they'll need to figure out the right incantation.
    
    Update #24161
    Update #26355
