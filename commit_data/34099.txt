    cmd/internal/obj/mips: fix use of R28 on 32-bit MIPS
    
    R28 is used as the SB register on MIPS64, and it was printed as
    "RSB" on both 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS. This is confusing on MIPS32
    as there R28 is just a general purpose register. Further, this
    string representation is used in the assembler's frontend to parse
    register symbols, and this leads to failure in parsing R28 in
    MIPS32 assembly code. Change rconv to always print the register
    as R28. This fixes the parsing problem on MIPS32, and this is
    a reasonable representation on both MIPS32 and MIPS64.
