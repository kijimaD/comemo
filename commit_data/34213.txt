    compiler: honor //line directives in DWARF variable file/line attrs
    
    During DWARF debug generation, the DW_AT_decl_line / DW_AT_decl_file
    attributes for variable DIEs were being computed without taking into
    account the possibility of "//line" directives. Fix things up to use
    the correct src.Pos methods to pick up this info.
    
    Fixes #23704.
