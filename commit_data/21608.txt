    [dev.cc] build: do not 'clean -i std' between dist and go_bootstrap
    
    Executing 'clean -i std' removes installed Go programs,
    including the toolchain binaries we need for building.
    It's not clear why the 'clean -i std' is here in the first place.
    cmd/dist just removed the entire pkg tree, so everything is new.
    The only reason for 'clean -i std' would be if you don't trust
    that dist compiled the packages properly. If that's true for
    some reason, we can fix cmd/dist, or add -a to the install
    commands that follow. Perhaps clean -i std should not
    remove tools, or perhaps std should not expand to any tools.
    Not sure.
    
    Also remove banner from make.bat and make.rc that was
    already removed from make.bash. cmd/dist prints it now.
    
    Also fix array size error in liblink/objfile.c.
    
    Fixes dev.cc build.
