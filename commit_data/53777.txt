    misc/wasm: switch default WASI runtime
    
    The default WASI runtime was originally set to Wazero, because it was
    the first runtime used to test the Go implementation and because we
    could easily find and fix issues in our implementation and theirs.
    
    In CL 498675 we switched the default wasip1 runner to Wasmtime as it
    runs faster and is a more established and mature runtime. We should
    switch the default runtime to Wasmtime to consistently promote
    Wasmtime as the primary tested and approved runtime.
