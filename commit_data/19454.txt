    cmd/gc: fix race compilation failure 'non-orig name'
    
    CL 51010045 fixed the first one of these:
    
            cmd/gc: return canonical Node* from temp
    
            For historical reasons, temp was returning a copy
            of the created Node*, not the original Node*.
            This meant that if analysis recorded information in the
            returned node (for example, n->addrtaken = 1), the
            analysis would not show up on the original Node*, the
            one kept in fn->dcl and consulted during liveness
            bitmap creation.
    
            Correct this, and watch for it when setting addrtaken.
    
            Fixes #7083.

    CL 53200043 fixed the second:
    
            cmd/gc: fix race build
    
            Missed this case in CL 51010045.

    This CL fixes the third. There are only three nod(OXXX, ...)
    calls in sinit.c, so maybe we're done. Embarassing that it
    took three CLs to find all three.
    
    Fixes #8028.
