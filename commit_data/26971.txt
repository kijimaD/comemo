    runtime: check kernel physical page size during init
    
    The runtime hard-codes an assumed physical page size. If this is
    smaller than the kernel's page size or not a multiple of it, sysUnused
    may incorrectly release more memory to the system than intended.
    
    Add a runtime startup check that the runtime's assumed physical page
    is compatible with the kernel's physical page size.
    
    For #9993.
