    gofmt: avoid endless loops
    
    With the (partial) resolution of identifiers done
    by the go/parser, ast.Objects point may introduce
    cycles in the AST. Don't follow *ast.Objects, and
    replace them with nil instead (they are likely
    incorrect after a rewrite anyway).
    
    - minor manual cleanups after reflect change automatic rewrite
    - includes fix by rsc related to reflect change
    
    Fixes #1667.
