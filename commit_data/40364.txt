    math/big: fix the bug in assembly implementation of shlVU on arm64
    
    For the case where the addresses of parameter z and x of the function
    shlVU overlap and the address of z is greater than x, x (input value)
    can be polluted during the calculation when the high words of x are
    overlapped with the low words of z (output value).
    
    Fixes #31084
