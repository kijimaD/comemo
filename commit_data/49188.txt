    runtime: add go:yeswritebarrierrec to panic functions
    
    Panic avoids any write barriers in the runtime by checking first
    and throwing if called inappropriately, so it is "okay".  Adding
    this annotation repairs recursive write barrier checking, which
    becomes more thorough when the local package naming convention
    is changed from "" to the actual package name.
    
    This CL is a prerequisite for a pending code cleanup,
