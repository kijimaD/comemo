    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: notify coordinator for minimization
    
    When a worker process finds a crasher, it now sends that result
    directly to the coordinator without attempting to minimize it
    first. The coordinator stops sending new inputs and sends the
    unminimized crasher back to a worker (any worker) for minimization.
    
    This prevents wasted work during minimization and will help us
    implement -keepfuzzing later on. We may also be able to minimize
    interesting inputs with this approach later.
    
    Since panics are recoverable errors (they don't terminate worker
    processes), we no longer attempt to minimize non-recoverable errors.
    This didn't work too well before: we lost too much state.
