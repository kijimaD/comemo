    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: Eval append args after growslice
    
    For appending large types, we want to evaluate the
    values being appended after the growslice call, not before.
    Evaluating them before leads to phi operations on large types
    which confuses the lowering pass.
    
    The order pass has already removed any side-effects from the
    values being appended, so it doesn't matter if we do this
    last eval before or after the growslice call.
    
    This change fixes a bunch (but not all) of our failed lowerings.
