    net/mail: better error in ParseAddress when missing "@domain"
    
    If the input was "John Doe", we're definitely missing "<email>", as
    "John Doe@domain" isn't a valid email address.
    
    However, if the input was "john.doe", it's possible that the user meant
    "john.doe@domain", and not just "john.doe <email>". Make it clear in the
    error that either could be the source of the problem.
    
    Fixes #27064.
