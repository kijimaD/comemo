    cmd/go/internal/load: make check for path in import error more robust
    
    When producing an ImportPathError from ImportErrorf, we check to see
    whether the error string contains the path for the error. The issue is
    that we were checking for the exact path string when sometimes the
    string is quoted when the error is constructed, and the escaping in the
    quote may not match the path string. Check for both the path string, and
    the quoted path string.
    
    Fixes #68737
