    doc/editors: remove feature matrix for various editors/IDEs
    
    The speed of feature development for these products outpaces the
    standard Go 6-month release cycle tied to this page. The cost of
    maintaining this list is becoming a burden as we make every
    attempt at being impartial. As of this writing, we believe feature
    lists belong on the pages of the editors/IDEs themselves.
