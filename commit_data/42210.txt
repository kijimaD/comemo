    runtime: crash if a signal is received with bad G and no extra M
    
    When we receive a signal, if G is nil we call badsignal, which
    calls needm. When cgo is not used, there is no extra M, so needm
    will just hang. In this situation, even GOTRACEBACK=crash cannot
    get a stack trace, as we're in the signal handler and cannot
    receive another signal (SIGQUIT).
    
    Instead, just crash.
    
    For #35554.
    Updates #34391.
