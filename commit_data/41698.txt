    crypto/tls: retry net.Dial flakes on Dragonfly
    
    localPipe currently flakes in various crypto/tls tests. Since that
    function doesn't seem to flake anywhere else, I suspect a kernel bug.
    
    To make the test less flaky, retry the Dial if we suspect that it is
    affected. (Worst case, we delay the test by a few seconds before
    erroring out as usual.)
    
    Fixes #29583
