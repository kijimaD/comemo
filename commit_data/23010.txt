    encoding/json: make BenchmarkSkipValue more stable
    
    BenchmarkSkipValue was sensitive to the value of
    b.N due to its significant startup cost.
    
    Two adjacent runs before this CL:
    
    BenchmarkSkipValue            50          21047499 ns/op          93.37 MB/s
    BenchmarkSkipValue           100          17260554 ns/op         118.05 MB/s
    
    After this CL, using benchtime to recreate the
    difference in b.N:
    
    BenchmarkSkipValue            50          15204797 ns/op         131.67 MB/s
    BenchmarkSkipValue           100          15332319 ns/op         130.58 MB/s
