    cmd/go: 'go get' should not delete binaries when run from $GOBIN
    
    When 'go install' is run without arguments in a directory containing a
    main package, it deletes an executable file with the same name as the
    package (presumably created by 'go build' previously).
    
    'go get' in module mode executes the same code after updating and
    downloading modules. However, the special case was misfiring because
    we passed an empty list of patterns to InstallPackages.
    
    Fixes #32766
