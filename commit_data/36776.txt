    cmd/go/internal/load: use lowercase package directory comparisons on Windows
    
    go build
    
    command is short for
    
    go build .
    
    and it builds . package. When command above is executed from
    directory inside of GOPATH, it uses GOPATH to calculate package
    source directory. So . package uses GOPATH as part of package
    source directory.
    
    On the other hand
    
    go build -ldflags=abc
    
    only passes flag to the linker for packages that are listed
    on the command line. The command above assumes . package again,
    and that package source path is compared with current directory.
    
    Current code compares result of os.Getwd with what GOPATH
    environment variable contains. But these values might differ
    in letter case on Windows. For example, one might return
    c:\gopath\..., while the other might contain C:\GOPATH.
    
    Fixes #24750
    Fixes #24232
    Fixes #25046
