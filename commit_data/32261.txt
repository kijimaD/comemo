    archive/tar: support PAX subsecond resolution times
    
    Add support for PAX subsecond resolution times. Since the parser
    supports negative timestamps, the formatter also handles negative
    timestamps.
    
    The relevant PAX specification is:
    <<<
    Portable file timestamps cannot be negative. If pax encounters a
    file with a negative timestamp in copy or write mode, it can reject
    the file, substitute a non-negative timestamp, or generate a
    non-portable timestamp with a leading '-'.
    >>>
    
    <<<
    All of these time records shall be formatted as a decimal
    representation of the time in seconds since the Epoch.
    If a <period> ( '.' ) decimal point character is present,
    the digits to the right of the point shall represent the units of
    a subsecond timing granularity, where the first digit is tenths of
    a second and each subsequent digit is a tenth of the previous digit.
    >>>
    
    Fixes #11171
