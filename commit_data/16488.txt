    build: add intptr typedef for Plan 9
    
    Revision 01810e5c68e9 added the following to src/pkg/runtime/stack.h:
    
            StackPreempt = (uintptr)(intptr)0xffffade,
    
    The typedef for intptr is defined in two places:
    
            1. src/pkg/runtime/runtime.h for use by the runtime
    
            2. include/u.h for use by the compilers and linkers
    
    On Plan 9, we don't use include/u.h but instead augment the host's
    u.h with extra typedefs. These are in include/plan9/GOARCH/u.h.
    
    We forgot to add intptr. It didn't cause a problem until now since
    that typedef was never used outside the runtime.
