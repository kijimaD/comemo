    unique,internal/concurrent: add some more tests
    
    One is a test of unsafe.String usage, which was broken before CL 610738
    was merged.
    
    The other is trying to improve coverage of "near collision" scenarios in
    the HashTrieMap where only the last few bits differ. This is intended to
    catch off-by-one errors in iterating down the tree.
    
    For #69534.
