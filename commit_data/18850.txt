    runtime: call symtabinit earlier
    
    Otherwise, we won't get a stack trace in some of the early init.
    
    Here's one example:
    
            http://build.golang.org/log/a96d10f6aee1fa3e3ae51f41da46d414a7ab02de
    
    After walking the stack by hand in acid, I was able to determine
    that the stackalloc inside mpreinit was causing the throw.
