    go/types: add Checker.walkDecl to simplify checking declarations
    
    Handling ast.GenDecls while typechecking is repetitive, and a source of
    diffs compared to typechecking using the cmd/compile/internal/syntax
    package, which unpacks declaration groups into individual declarations.
    
    Refactor to extract the logic for walking declarations.  This introduces
    a new AST abstraction: types.decl, which comes at some minor performance
    cost. However, if we are to fully abstract the AST we will be paying
    this cost anyway, and benchmarking suggests that the cost is negligible.
