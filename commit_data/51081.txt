    runtime/race: rebuild darwin syso to work around macOS 12 malloc reserved address
    
    On macOS 12 a new malloc implementation (nano) is used by default,
    and apparently it reserves address range
    0x600000000000-0x600020000000, which conflicts with the address
    range that TSAN uses for Go. Work around the issue by changing the
    address range slightly.
    
    The actual change is made on LLVM at https://reviews.llvm.org/D114825 .
    This CL includes syso's built with the patch applied.
    
    Fixes #49138.
