    io/fs: fix reference to WalkFunc
    
    The comment explains differences between WalkDirFunc and WalkFunc,
    but when this code moved out of path/filepath, we forgot to change
    the reference to be filepath.WalkFunc. Fix that.
    
    (The text should not be deleted, because path/filepath does not
    contain this type - WalkDirFunc - nor this text anymore.)
    
    Pointed out by Carl Johnson on CL 243916 post-submit.
    
    For #41190.
