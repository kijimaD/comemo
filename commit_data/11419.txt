    godoc: move overview before API TOC

    Especially for packages with large APIs, this makes the
    overview more promiment, so that it can give the appropriate
    context for reading the API list.  This should help significantly
    in packages with large APIs, like net, so that the first thing users
    see is not a jumble of functions but an introduction to the package.
