    cmd/cc: Fix -I switch to handle a path with blankspaces correctly
    
    Currently, -I switch can't deal with a path containing spaces.
    This commit simplify setinclude(), by removing the special case
    of a string that had spaces. After this change, setinclude() will
    merely add the given directories to the include path, if it does
    not yet exist, and this approach works.
    
    Will be needed for solving issue 115.
