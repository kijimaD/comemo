    runtime/race: deflake test
    
    The test sometimes fails on builders.
    The test uses sleeps to establish the necessary goroutine
    execution order. If sleeps undersleep/oversleep
    the race is still reported, but it can be reported when the
    main test goroutine returns. In such case test driver
    can't match the race with the test and reports failure.
    
    Wait for both test goroutines to ensure that the race
    is reported in the test scope.
    
    Fixes #15579
