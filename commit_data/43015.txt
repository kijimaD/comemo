    time: use values larger than 24 for day for time.Format examples
    
    Currently, the time.Format docs use 7 Mar 2015 as the day/month/year. In numeric
    form, that is either 7/3/2015 or 3/7/2015 depending on which part of the world
    you're from. This is extremely confusing.
    
    In fact, the reference time being defined in a very US-centric way is quite
    confusing for the rest of the world, too [1].
    
    We can't change that, but we can make the time.Format docs more comprehendable
    to the rest of the world without sacrificing by simply choosing a day that is
    not ambiguous (a value greater than 24 for day). This CL does makes the
    necessary change.
    
    Note: this CL moves some of the padding examples into their own example, since
    those examples do need a <10 day to demonstrate padding.
    
    1: Additional context: a very old golang-nuts thread in which Rob expresses some
    regret about the format being the USA standard, rather than the alternative:
