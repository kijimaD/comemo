    cmd/link: ensure cgo cflags do not leak into dwarf tests
    
    Running the dwarf tests with CGO_CFLAGS set
    with certain values would cause the test to fail. all.bash
    would fail when CGO_CFLAGS was set to '-mmacosx-version-min=10.10'
    because the --macosx-version-min flag is incompatible with some dwarf
    tests. The change guards against using an unintended flag in the unit test.
    
    Updates #35459
