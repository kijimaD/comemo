    [dev.link] cmd/link: set attributes atomically
    
    Now concurrent relocsym may access symbols attributes
    concurrently, causing data race when using the race detector. I
    think it is still safe as we read/write on different bits, and
    not write the same symbol's attributes from multiple goroutines,
    so it will always reads the right value regardless whether the
    write happens before or after, as long as the memory model is not
    so insane.
    
    Use atomic accesses to appease the race detector. It doesn't seem
    to cost much, at least on x86.
