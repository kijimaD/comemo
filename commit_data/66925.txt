    runtime: don't restore from g0.sched in systemstack on arm64
    
    On arm64, systemstack restores the frame pointer from g0.sched to R29
    prior to calling the callback. That doesn't really make any sense. The
    frame pointer value in g0.sched is some arbitrary BP from a prior
    context save, but that is not the caller of systemstack.
    
    amd64 does not do this. In fact, it leaves BP completely unmodified so
    frame pointer unwinders like gdb can walk through the systemstack frame
    and continue traceback on the caller's stack. Unlike mcall, systemstack
    always returns to the original goroutine, so that is safe.
    
    We should do the same on arm64.
    
    For #63630.
