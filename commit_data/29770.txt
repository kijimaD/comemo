    cmd/trace: move process-wide GC events to their own row
    
    Currently, the process-wide GC state is attributed to the P that
    happened to perform the allocation that exceeded the GC trigger. This
    is pretty arbitrary and makes it hard to see when GC is running since
    the GC spans are intermingled with a lot of other trace noise.
    
    The current display is particularly confusing because it creates three
    sub-rows in the P row that can overlap each other. Usually a P has
    just two sub-rows: one showing the current G and another showing that
    G's activity. However, because GC is attributed to a proc, it winds up
    as a third row that neither subsumes nor is subsumed by any other row.
    This in turn screws up the trace's layout and results in overlapping
    events.
    
    Fix these problems by creating a new dedicated row like the existing
    "Network" and "Timer" rows and displaying process-wide GC events in
    this row. Mark termination and sweep events still appear in their
    respective P rows because these are meaningfully attributed.
