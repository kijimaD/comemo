    runtime: fix endianness assumption when decoding ftab
    
    The ftab ends with a half functab record consisting only of
    the 'entry' field followed by a uint32 giving the offset of
    the next table.  Previously, symtabinit assumed it could read
    this uint32 as a uintptr.  Since this is unsafe on big endian,
    explicitly read the offset as a uint32.
