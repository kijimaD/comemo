    cmd/compile/internal/pgo: remove node weights from IRNode
    
    Actual PGO operation doesn't use these weights at all. They are
    theoretically used when printing a dot graph for debugging, but that
    doesn't actually work because these weights are always zero.
    
    These fields are initialized by looking for a NodeMap entry with key
    {CallerName: sym, CalleeName: "", CallSiteOffset: 0}. These entries will
    never exist, as we never put entries in NodeMap without CalleeName.
    
    Since they aren't really used and don't work, just remove them entirely,
    which offers nice simplification.
    
    This leaves IRNode with just a single field. I keep the type around as a
    future CL will make the *ir.Func optional, allowing nodes with a name
    but no IR.
