    runtime: delete addtimer
    
    modtimer can always be used in place of addtimer.
    Do that and delete addtimer, avoiding duplicated logic.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
