    go/internal/gccgoimporter: skip new test with aliases with old gccgo
    
    Add the issue31540 test to the list of tests that needs to be skipped
    with old copies of gccgo. Along the way, add an explicit field to the
    importer test struct that can be used to tag the test (as opposed to
    having special cases by name in the test routine), so as to make it
    easier to remember to tag testcases correctly.
    
    Fixes #31764.
