    cmd/link: fix for package name attr testpoint in dwarf_test.go
    
    Tighten up a testpoint that looks for the compile unit
    DW_AT_go_package_name attribute. The linker code that injects this
    attribute was accidentally broken on the dev.link branch, but in a way
    that wasn't detected by the test (attr was generated, but always with
    an empty string). The new test will fail if the attr is an empty
    string, or if we can't find the attribute for the runtime package.
