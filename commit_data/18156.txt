    syscall: handle varied path lengths for unix sockets
    
    Most BSDs include the trailing NUL character of the socket path in the
    length, however some do not (such as NetBSD 6.99). Handle this by only
    subtracting the family and length bytes from the returned length, then
    scanning the path and removing any terminating NUL bytes.
    
    Fixes #6627.
