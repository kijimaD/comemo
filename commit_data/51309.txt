    cmd/dist: add curiously missing GOOS/GOARCH combinations
    
    The cmd/dist cgo_test enumerates a large number of platforms in
    various special cases. Some combinations are suspiciously absent. This
    CL completes the combinations.
    
    I've confirmed using trybots that the newly-enabled tests pass on
    android/* (this is not surprising because the gohostos is never
    "android" anyway), windows/arm64, linux/ppc64 (no cgo), linux/loong64
    (except for one test, filed #56623), linux/mips*, netbsd/arm (except
    for one test, filed #56629), and netbsd/arm64. The windows/arm builder
    is out to lunch, so I'm assuming that works. Since netbsd/arm and
    arm64 mostly passed these tests, I've also enabled them on netbsd/386
    and netbsd/amd64, where they seem to work fine as well.
    
    Preparation for #37486.
