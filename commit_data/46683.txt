    cmd/link: add runtime.text.N symbols to Mach-O symbol table
    
    On Darwin/ARM64 when external linking, for very large text we
    split it into multiple sections. For each section (other than the
    first) we create runtime.text.N marker symbols. In CL 316050 I
    forgot to add those symbols to the symbol table. This CL does it.
    
    It doesn't actually matter for program execution. But we add them
    on ELF when splitting text sections, so we do it here as well.
    Also, this makes it easier to tell if we split text sections.
