    [dev.typeparams] go/parser: accept "~" and "|" interface elements
    
    This is a port of CL 307371 to go/parser, adding support for the new
    embedded type expressions. As in that CL, type lists continue to be
    accepted.
    
    This CL also revealed a pre-existing bug related to embedded instances:
    the parser was failing to parse embedded instances with multiple type
    arguments, due to not consuming the initial ','. This is fixed, and
    along the way TestErrors is modified to use subtests.
    
    Several missing tests cases were added to exprstring_test.go. These must
    have been missed in an earlier CL.
