    cmd/go,cmd/compile: re-enable concurrent compilation on darwin/arm64
    
    I've manually reviewed all uses of ctxt.Flag_shared for concurrency safety.
    And I manually tested with the race detector and found no issues.
    Allow -shared to be used with compiler concurrency,
    thereby re-enabling concurrent compilation on darwin/arm64.
    
    Fixes #48496
