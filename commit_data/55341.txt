    cmd/dist: skip building std for the host when cross-compiling
    
    The purpose of building the host toolchain is so that we can use it to
    build and test the target configuration.
    
    The host configuration should already be tested separately (with its
    own builder), so we do not need to build the parts of that
    configuration that are not relevant to the task of building and
    testing the target configuration.
    
    Updates #47257.
