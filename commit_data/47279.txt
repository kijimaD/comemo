    [dev.fuzz] testing: use exit status 70 for worker errors (not crashes)
    
    If a worker process encounters an error communicating with the
    coordinator, or if the setup code reports an error with F.Fail
    before calling F.Fuzz, exit with status 70. The coordinator will report
    these errors and 'go test' will exit non-zero, but the coordinator
    won't record a crasher since the problem is not in the code being
    fuzzed.
    
    The coordinator also detects unexpected terminations before the worker
    calls F.Fuzz by sending a ping RPC. If the worker terminates before
    responding to the ping RPC, the coordinator won't record a crasher.
    
    Exit codes are chosen somewhat arbitrary, but in the Advanced Bash
    Scripting Guide, 70 is "internal software error" which is applicable
    here. 70 is also ASCII 'F'.
