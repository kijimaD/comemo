    cmd/internal/obj/s390x: remove support for stores of global addresses
    
    This CL removes support for MOVD instructions that store the address
    of a global variable. For example:
    
      MOVD $main·a(SB), (R1)
      MOVD $main·b(SB), main·c(SB)
    
    These instructions are emulated and the new backend doesn't need them
    (the stores now always go through an intermediate register).
