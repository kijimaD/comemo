    go/ast: remove FuncDecl.IsMethod for Go 1.17
    
    The IsMethod method was added to FuncDecl in the process of working on
    support for type parameters, but is now only used in one place. It also
    didn't go through the proposal process. Remove it for 1.17.
    
    Also clean up a doc comment that mentioned type parameters.
    
    Fixes #46297
