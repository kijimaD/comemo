    net/http/cgi: workaround for closure inlining issue
    
    This is a temporary workaround for issue #62277, to get the longtest
    builders passing again. As mentioned on the issue, the underlying
    issue was present even before CL 522318; it just now affects inlined
    closures in initialization expressions too, not just explicit init
    functions.
    
    This CL can and should be reverted once that issue is fixed properly.
