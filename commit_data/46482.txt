    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: fix ICE due to large uint64 constants
    
    It's an error to call Int64Val on constants that don't fit into
    int64. CL 272654 made the compiler stricter about detecting misuse,
    and revealed that we were using it improperly in detecting consecutive
    integer-switch cases. That particular usage actually did work in
    practice, but it's easy and best to just fix it.
    
    Fixes #43480.
