    Implement if, for (modulo ranges), break, continue, increment,
    and decrement.  blockCompilers now form a tree the mimics the
    nesting of scopes and provide convenient ways to enter and
    exit scopes.  blockCompilers also track the break and continue
    PC for the current block.  The statement testing interface now
    works in lists of statements, which simplifies a bunch of
    things.
