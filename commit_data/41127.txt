    misc/cgo/test: use __atomic intrinsics instead of __sync
    
    GCC has supported the __atomic intrinsics since 4.7, and clang
    supports them as well. They are better than the __sync intrinsics in
    that they specify a memory model and, more importantly for our purposes,
    they are reliably implemented either in the compiler or in libatomic.
