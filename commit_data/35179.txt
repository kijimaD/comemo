    cmd/compile: in prove, infer unsigned relations while branching
    
    When a branch is followed, we apply the relation as described
    in the domain relation table. In case the relation is in the
    positive domain, we can also infer an unsigned relation if,
    by that point, we know that both operands are non-negative.
    
    Fixes #20393
