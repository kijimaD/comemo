+Does Go have a runtime?</h3>
+
+<p>
+Go does have an extensive library, called the <em>runtime</em>,
+that is part of every Go program.
+The runtime library implements garbage collection, concurrency,
+stack management, and other critical features of the Go language.
+Although it is more central to the language, Go's runtime is analogous
+to <code>libc</code>, the C library.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+It is important to understand, however, that Go's runtime does not
+include a virtual machine, such as is provided by the Java runtime.
+Go programs are compiled ahead of time to native machine code.
+Thus, although the term is often used to describe the virtual
+environment in which a program runs, in Go the word &ldquo;runtime&rdquo;
+is just the name given to the library providing critical language services.
