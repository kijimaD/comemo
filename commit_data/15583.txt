    spec: terminating statements for functions
    
    The only functional change is the new section
    on terminating statements.
    
    There is a minor syntax rewrite (not change)
    of function declarations to make it easier to
    refer to the notion of a function from all places
    where it is used (function decls, method decls,
    and function literals).
    
    Includes some minor fixes/additions of missing links.
    
    Based closely on Russ' proposal.
    
    Fixes #65.
