    CONTRIBUTORS: first round of automated updates for Go 1.12
    
    These updates have been automatically generated using a modified
    version of the updateac command with the following changes:
    
    -       code to automatically update the AUTHORS file has been removed,
            since we're not updating that file automatically after Go 1.11
            (see CL 128877)
    -       CLA checking code has been removed, since it was primarily needed
            for updating the AUTHORS file
    -       instead of executing the misc/sortac binary, its code was embedded
            into the updateac command itself
    
    The modified updateac command will be added to x/build repository soon,
    and the misc/sortac command can be removed afterwards.
    
    Updates #12042
