    runtime: normalize sigprof traceback flags
    
    Each gentraceback call uses a different set of flags. Combine these into
    a common variable, only adjusted as necessary.
    
    The effective changes here are:
    
    * cgo traceback now has _TraceJumpStack. This is a no-op since it
      already passes curg.
    * libcall traceback now has _TraceJumpStack. This is a behavior change
      and will allow following stack transitions if a libcall is performed on
      g0.
    * VDSO traceback drops _TraceTrap. vdsoPC is a return address, so
      _TraceTrap was not necessary.
