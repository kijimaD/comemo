    internal/trace: reduce event size by packing goroutine statuses
    
    The trace parser was using an otherwise-unused event argument to hold an
    extra goroutine state argument for the GoStatus & GoStatusStack events.
    This is needed because the execution tracer just records the "after" for
    state transitions, but we want to have both the "before" and "after"
    states available in the StateTransition info for the parsed event. When
    GoStatusStack was added, the size of the argument array was increased to
    still have room for the extra status. However, statuses are currently
    only 1 byte, and the status argument is 8 bytes, so there is plenty of
    room to pack the "before" and "after" statuses in a single argument. Do
    that instead to avoid the need for an extra argument.
