    go/types: in TestCheck/issues.src, import regexp/syntax instead of cmd/compile/internal/syntax
    
    TestCheck/issues.src was failing after running
            rm -r $(go env GOROOT)/pkg/*/cmd
    as the builders do when building binary releases.
    
    For users who write programs that depend on go/types, it should be
    reasonable for end users to run the tests for go/types as part of 'go
    test all', and those tests should pass even if they installed Go from
    a binary release.
    
    The test case in issues.src was importing cmd/compile/internal/syntax
    in order to check the reported package name.
    
    I tried to fix the problem by having the test import from source
    instead of from export data. Unfortunately, that changed the behavior
    under test: the go/types.Package.Imports reports (and is documented to
    report) a different set of imported packages when loading from source
    as compared to when loading from export data.
    
    For this particular test, after CL 313035 that difference resulted in
    go/types treating the "syntax" name as ambiguous when importing from
    source, because a transitive dependency on "regexp/syntax" is found
    when loading from source but omitted when loading from export data.
    
    The simple fix to make the package unambiguous again is to adapt the
    test to import regexp/syntax directly. That not only makes the package
    unambiguous with all importers, but also avoids depending on a
    cmd-internal package that cannot be loaded from export data in binary
    distributions of the Go toolchain.
    
    For #43232
