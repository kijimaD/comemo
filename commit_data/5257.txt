commit 12e7ce95c697b85bd78a652dd6f4a7a0e81cf72a
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>

    Add //export to cgo.
    
    The new //export comment marks a Go function as callable from
    C.  The syntax is "//export NAME" where NAME is the name of
    the function as seen from C.  If such a comment is seen, cgo
    will generate two new files: _cgo_export.h and _cgo_export.c.
    The _cgo_export.h file provides declarations which C code may
    use to call Go functions.  The _cgo_export.c file contains
    wrappers, and is to be compiled with gcc.
    
    The changes to Make.pkg support using this from a Go Makefile,
    though it could probably be more convenient.
