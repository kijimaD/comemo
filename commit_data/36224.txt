    misc/ios: speed up the iOS exec wrapper
    
    First, take the exclusive lock that ensures only one running binary
    later: after assembling the gotest.app directory and signing it.
    
    Second, don't pass -r to ios-deploy. The -r flag uninstalls the
    app before installing it. It seems unnecessary, takes extra time
    and if there was only the one developer app on the phone, it
    will drop the developer permission on uninstall.
