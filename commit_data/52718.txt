    cmd/go: reference BuildID field from list's -export docs
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/263542 we added BuildID to the Package struct
    in the docs for "go list", correctly pointing out that it's only set
    when -export is used.
    
    Further down, the doc details the -export flag on its own.
    It already mentioned the Export field, and we forgot to add a mention to
    BuildID as well. Do that.
