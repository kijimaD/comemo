    cmd/go/internal/modfetch: correct TestCodeRepo expectation
    
    The proxy protocol was simplified to only send
    (and only receive) the Path and Version fields
    in the JSON blob, not Name and Short.
    (Those make sense when querying a VCS repo directly,
    but not when talking about extracted modules.)
    So don't expect them in the test.
    
    Fixes #27042.
