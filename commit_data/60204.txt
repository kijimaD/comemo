+<!-- go.dev/issue/65316 -->
+The `trace` tool now better tolerates partially broken traces by attempting to
+recover what trace data it can. This functionality is particularly helpful when
+viewing a trace that was collected during a program crash, since the trace data
+leading up to the crash will now [be recoverable](/issue/65319) under most
+circumstances.

+The runtime now explicitly flushes trace data when a program crashes due to an
+uncaught panic. This means that more complete trace data will be available in a
+trace if the program crashes while tracing is active.
