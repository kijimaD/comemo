-<p>
-The Go Playground is a web service that runs on 
-<a href="http://golang.org/">golang.org</a>'s servers.
-The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside 
-a sandbox, then returns the output.
-</p>

-There are limitations to the programs that can be run in the Playground.
-They must be single-threaded (but they may use many goroutines).
-There are also limits on execution time, and CPU and memory usage.
-The Playground can access only a subset of the standard library
-(notably absent are network and file system access).
-Therefore, the only communication a Playground program has to the outside world
-is via standard output.
