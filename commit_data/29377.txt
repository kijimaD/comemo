    doc: document minimum OS X version as 10.8
    
    The download page says "OS X 10.8 or later", but other pages said 10.7.
    Say 10.8 everywhere.
    
    Turns out Go doesn't even compile on OS X 10.7 (details in bug) and we
    only run builders for OS X 10.8+, which is likely why 10.7
    regressed. Until recently we only had OS X 10.10 builders, even.
    
    We could run 10.7 builders, but there's basically no reason to do so,
    especially with 10.12 coming out imminently.
    
    Fixes #16625
