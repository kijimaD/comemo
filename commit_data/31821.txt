    cmd/gofmt: unindent the second line of a BUG note
    
    Currently, this second line is treated a pre-formatted text as it's
    indented relatively to the BUG() line.
    
    The current state can be seen at:
    
      https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/#pkg-note-BUG
    
    Unindenting makes the rest of the sentence part of the same paragraph.
