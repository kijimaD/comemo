    cmd/compile: fix extraneous diff in generated files
    
    Looks like CL 475735 contained a not-quite-up-to-date version
    of the generated file. Maybe ABSFL was in an earlier version of the CL
    and was removed before checkin without regenerating the generated file?
    
    In any case, update the generated file. Shouldn't cause a problem, as
    that field isn't used in x86/ssa.go.
