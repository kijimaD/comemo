commit 81eb930f7e021e334ec2b54dc4ba6b1ab825887f
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 9 17:36:31 2013 -0500

    spec: clarify that any unsafe.Pointer type is okay in conversion
    
    The spec is not clear about whether this is allowed or not,
    but both compilers allow it, because the reflect implementation
    takes advantage of it. Document current behavior.
    
    Fixes #4679.
