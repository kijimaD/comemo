    cmd/asm: rename R18 to R18_PLATFORM on ARM64
    
    In ARM64 ABI, R18 is the "platform register", the use of which is
    OS specific. The OS could choose to reserve this register. In
    practice, it seems fine to use R18 on Linux but not on darwin (iOS).
    
    Rename R18 to R18_PLATFORM to prevent accidental use. There is no
    R18 usage within the standard library (besides tests, which are
    updated).
    
    Fixes #26110
