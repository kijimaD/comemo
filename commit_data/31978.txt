    cmd/compile: strengthen SetFields/Width safety guarantee
    
    It is currently possible in the compiler to create a struct type,
    calculate the widths of types that depend on it,
    and then alter the struct type.
    
    transformclosure has local protection against this.
    Protect against it at a deeper level.
    
    This is preparation to call dowidth automatically,
    rather than explicitly.
    
    This is a re-roll of CL 38469.
