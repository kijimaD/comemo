    net/http: revert overly-strict part of earlier smuggling defense
    
    The recent https://golang.org/cl/11810 is reportedly a bit too
    aggressive.
    
    Apparently some HTTP requests in the wild do contain both a
    Transfer-Encoding along with a bogus Content-Length. Instead of
    returning a 400 Bad Request error, we should just ignore the
    Content-Length like we did before.
