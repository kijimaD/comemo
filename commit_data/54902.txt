    cmd/compile: fix findIndVar so it does not match disjointed loop headers
    
    Fix #63955
    
    parseIndVar, prove and maybe more are on the assumption that the loop header
    is a single block. This can be wrong, ensure we don't match theses cases we
    don't know how to handle.
    
    In the future we could update them so that they know how to handle such cases
    but theses cases seems rare so I don't think the value would be really high.
    We could also run a loop canonicalization pass first which could handle this.
    
    The repro case looks weird because I massaged it so it would crash with the
    previous compiler.
