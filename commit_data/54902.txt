    cmd/link: improved host archive debug trace output
    
    When ctxt.Debugvlog > 1, produce additional trace output to describe
    which object files are being pulled out of host archive libraries and
    why they were pulled (e.g. which symbol had a reference to something
    in a library). Intended to make it easier to debug problems with cgo
    internal linking.
