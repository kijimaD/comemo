    cmd/dist: Make windows.c's fatal() print to stderr
    
    Generating env.bat using dist env -wp > env.bat failed silently
    if case of an error, because the message was redirected to env.bat.
    Verbose messages still go to stdout, causing problems, but that's
    a seperate change.
    Made errprintf() identical to xprintf(), except for the output handle.
    Yes, it's duplicate code, but most of the function is unpacking
    the argument list and preparing it for WriteFile(), which has to be
    done anyway.
