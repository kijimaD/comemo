    misc/cgo/test: disable issue 8428 regress test on darwin
    
    Clang 3.2 and older (as shipped with OS X Mountain Lion and older)
    outputs ambiguous DWARF debug info that makes it impossible for us to
    reconstruct accurate type information as required for this test.
    
    Fixes #8611.
