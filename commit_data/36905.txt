    cmd/compile: mark BS{F,R}L as clobbering flags
    
    Turns out it doesn't currently matter, as these ops are always issued
    together with a BTSL which does clobber flags. So I can't write a test
    that currently fails. But better to be future-proof.
    
    BS{F,R}Q generates flags, so it doesn't need to be marked as clobbering.
