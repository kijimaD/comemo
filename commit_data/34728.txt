    cmd/trace: assign a unique span id for slice representation
    
    Spans are represented using Async Event types of chrome trace viewer.
    According to the doc, the 'id' should be unique within category, scope.

    Use the index in the task's span slice as the slice id, so it
    can be unique within the task. The scope is the task id which
    is unique.
    
    This fixes a visualization bug that caused incorrect or missing
    presentation of nested spans.
