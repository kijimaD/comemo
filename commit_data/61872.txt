    runtime: add note that Callers never returns an entry PC
    
    The presence of a pc > entry check in CallersFrame implies we might
    actually see pc == entry, when in reality Callers will never return such
    a PC. This check is actually just a safety check for avoid reporting
    completely nonsensical from bad input.
    
    all.bash reports two violations to this invariant:
    
    TestCallersFromWrapper, which explicitly constructs a CallersFrame input
    with an entry PC.
    
    runtime/pprof.printStackRecord, which passes pprof stacks to
    CallersFrame (technically not a valid use of CallersFrames!).
    runtime/pprof.(*Profile).Add can add the entry PC of
    runtime/pprof.lostProfileEvent to samples.
    
    (CPU profiles do lostProfileEvent + 1. I will send a second CL to fix
    Add.)
