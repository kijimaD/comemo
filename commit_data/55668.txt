    cmd/compile: relax overly strict assertion
    
    The assertion here was to make sure the newly constructed and
    typechecked expression selected the same receiver-qualified method,
    but in the case of anonymous receiver types we can actually end up
    with separate types.Field instances corresponding to each types.Type
    instance. In that case, the assertion spuriously failed.
    
    The fix here is to relax and assertion and just compare the method's
    name and type (including receiver type).
    
    Fixes #58563.
