    runtime: fix sudog leak in syncsemrelease
    
    Manifested as increased memory usage in a Google production system.
    
    Not an unbounded leak, but can significantly increase the number
    of sudogs allocated between garbage collections.
    
    I checked all the other calls to acquireSudog.
    This is the only one that was missing a releaseSudog.
