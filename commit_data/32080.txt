    cmd/internal/obj: use string instead of LSym in Pcln
    
    In a concurrent backend, Ctxt.Lookup will need some
    form of concurrency protection, which will make it
    more expensive.
    
    This CL changes the pcln table builder to track
    filenames as strings rather than LSyms.
    Those strings are then converted into LSyms
    at the last moment, for writing the object file.
    
    This CL removes over 85% of the calls to Ctxt.Lookup
    in a run of make.bash.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
    
    Updates #15756
