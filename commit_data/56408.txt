    cmd/compile: stop using internal/godebug
    
    The main reason not to use internal/godebug is that
    people often set GODEBUGs to change the behavior
    of the programs they are running with 'go run' or 'go test'.
    We don't want the compiler to behave differently as well
    in that case: that's too many changes.
    
    Using internal/godebug also breaks bootstrapping
    with toolchains that don't have it, or future toolchains
    that have a different API in that package.
