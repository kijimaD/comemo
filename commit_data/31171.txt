    cmd/link: only include the version info and export data in ABI hash
    
    Previously the "ABI hash" for a package (used to determine if a loaded shared
    library has the ABI expected by its loader) was the hash of the entire
    __.PKGDEF file. But that means it depends on the build ID generated by the go
    tool for the package, which means that if a file is added (even a .c or .h
    file!) to the package, the ABI changes, perhaps uncessarily.
    
    Fixes #19920
