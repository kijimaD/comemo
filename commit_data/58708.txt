    cmd/go: add errors obtaining c compiler version to cache key
    
    If there's an error getting the version of the c compiler, add the error
    to the input used to produce the cache key. In the case where we can't
    parse the version, the text of the output of the command is part of the
    error, so different unparseable versions will produce different cache
    keys. Before, we wouldn't add anything to the key when there was an
    error getting the version, so we wouldn't distinguish a missing compiler
    from one where we couldn't parse the version.
    
    Fixes #64589
