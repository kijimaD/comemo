    cmd/dist: ensure android-implies-linux for file names in dist
    
    This is one hurdle to building Go on Android; the runtime does
    not build properly because *_linux.go files are excluded from
    the "Building go_bootstrap" step when GOOS=android.
    
    There are other hurdles; this is the first one.
