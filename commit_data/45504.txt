    net/http: use exponential backoff for polling in Server.Shutdown
    
    Instead of always polling 500ms, start with an interval of 1ms and
    exponentially back off to at most 500ms. 10% jitter is added to each
    interval.
    
    This makes Shutdown more responsive when connections and listeners
    close quickly.
    
    Also removes the need for the polling interval to be changed in tests
    since if tests' connections and listeners close quickly Shutdown will
    also return quickly.
    
    Fixes #42156
