    cmd/go/internal/modload: fix use of //go:linkname
    
    I can't find the exact rule about space before compiler directive
    openings from
    https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives
    but it seems like the compiler doesn't recognize it
    as a compiler directive if it is preceded by space.
    Removing the space made the //go:linkname in the __gomod__.go file
    working as intended.
    
    Manually tested.
    
    Update #26404
