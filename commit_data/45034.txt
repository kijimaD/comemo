    cmd/compile: reduce overhead of RParams in types.Type
    
    Changed RParams in types.Type to be a pointer to a slice, rather than a
    slice itself, in order to reduce it from three words to one words, since
    the large majority of types will not be generic or instantiated from a
    generic type.
    
    Additional cleanup: remove operation OTYPEINST, which we don't have need
    of, since all type instantiations are either handled by types2 or happen
    automatically during some form of stenciling.
    
    Both of these are useful cleanups before the Go 1.17 freeze.
