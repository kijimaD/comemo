    os/signal: run TestNotifyContextNotifications subtests in parallel
    
    If we run out of time on the first subtest, we don't want to start the
    second one with essentially no time remaining. (Moreover, there is no
    compelling reason not to run these tests in parallel, since they send
    signals to separate processes.)
    
    For #51054.
