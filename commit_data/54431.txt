    cmd/compile: fix position of fake receivers; be more careful in logopt
    
    The src.NoXPos in fake receivers was leaking, through a series of
    mishaps, all the way to logopt.  If done just so, this can lead to
    a compiler crash.  This makes logopt crash-proof and eliminates the
    root cause as well.
    
    I'm reluctant to write a test for this because it's kinda slow
    and involved; my working test is "compile something that mentions
    the flag package with -json=0,$TMPDIR flag, then be sure that
    $TMPDIR/flag/__unnamed__.json was not created".
