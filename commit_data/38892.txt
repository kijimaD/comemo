    crypto/x509: re-enable TestSystemRoots
    
    Now that the cgo and no-cgo paths should be correct and equivalent,
    re-enable the TestSystemRoots test without any margin of error (which
    was tripping anyway when users had too many of a certain edge-case).
    
    As a last quirk, the verify-cert invocation will validate certificates
    that aren't roots, but are signed by valid roots. Ignore them.
    
    Fixes #24652
