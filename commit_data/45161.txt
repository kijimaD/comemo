    runtime: minor refactoring of _rt0_amd64_lib
    
    This function bounces between the C and Go ABIs a few times. This CL
    narrows the scope of the Go -> C transition to just around the branch
    that calls C. This lets us take advantage of C callee-save registers
    to simplify the code a little.
