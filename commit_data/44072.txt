    runtime: avoid overflow from linearAlloc
    
    Currently linearAlloc manages an exclusive "end" address for the top of
    its reserved space. While unlikely for a linearAlloc to be allocated
    with an "end" address hitting the top of the address space, it is
    possible and could lead to overflow.
    
    Avoid overflow by chopping off the last byte from the linearAlloc if
    it's bumping up against the top of the address space defensively. In
    practice, this means that if 32-bit platforms map the top of the address
    space and use the linearAlloc to acquire arenas, the top arena will not
    be usable.
    
    Fixes #35954.
