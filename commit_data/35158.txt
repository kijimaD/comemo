    cmd/trace: have tasks in a separate section (process group)
    
    Also change tasks to be represented as "slices" instead of
    asynchronous events which are more efficiently represented in trace
    viewer data model. This change allows to utilize the flow events
    (arrows) to represent task hierarchies.
    
    Introduced RegionArgs and TaskArgs where the task id infomation and
    goroutine id informations are stored for information-purpose.
