    runtime: yield instead of sleeping in runqgrab on OpenBSD
    
    OpenBSD has a coarse sleep granularity that rounds up to 10 ms
    increments. This can cause significant STW delays, among other issues.
    As far as I can tell, there's only 1 tightly timed sleep without an
    explicit wakeup for which this actually matters.
    
    Fixes #52475.
