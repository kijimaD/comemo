    internal/poll: change Fsync to fallback to syscall.Fsync on darwin
    
    In certain scenarios, such as network mounts, calling Fsync results in
    ENOTSUP in OSX. This issue was introduced in CL 130676 since
    syscall.FSync was not properly flushing contents to disk, and it was
    replaced with fcntl(fd, F_FULLSYNC). Most SMB servers, like Windows
    Server and Samba don't support F_FULLSYNC.
    
    To avoid such issues fallback to syscall.Fsync if fcntl returns ENOTSUP.
    
    Fixes #64215
