    net/http: Add Server.RegisterOnShutdown
    
    This will be used to allow http2 servers to register a shutdown function
    so that net/http.Server.Shutdown will work when the http2 server is
    configured via a manual call to http2.ConfigureServer. Currently, Shutdown
    only works when the http2 server is configured automatically by the
    net/http package.
