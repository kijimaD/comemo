    cmd/6c, cmd/8c: fix print format for Prog
    
    The FmtLong flag should only be used with the %D verb
    when printing an ATEXT Prog. It was erroneously used
    for every Prog except ADATA. This caused a preponderance
    of exclamation points, "!!", in the assembly listings.
    
    I also cleaned up the code so that the list.c files look
    very similar. Now the real differences are easily spotted
    with a simple diff.
