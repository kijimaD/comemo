    cmd/dist: update tryDirs list to match make scripts
    
    The $HOME/sdk/go1.17 and $HOME/go1.17 paths were initially added as
    places to look for a bootstrap toolchain to make.{bash,bat,rc} scripts
    and in cmd/dist (CL 370274). Those two go1.17 directories have since
    been updated in the make scripts to go1.20.6 (CL 512275) and later on
    to go1.22.6 (CL 606156), but the same list in cmd/dist was missed.
    
    Fix the inconsistency now. But maybe cmd/dist doesn't need to maintain
    this logic, if it's required to be invoked via one of the make scripts,
    since they're responsible for setting GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP?
    
    For #64751.
