    net/http: eliminate arbitrary timeouts in TestServerRequestContextCancel_ConnClose
    
    These timeouts are empirically sometimes (but rarely) too short on
    slower builders, and at any rate if this test fails “for real” we'll
    want a goroutine dump in order to debug it anyway. A goroutine dump is
    exactly what we get if we let the test time out on its own.
    
    Fixes #52414.
