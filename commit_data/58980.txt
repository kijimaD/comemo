    net: in the fake implementation, allow writes to buffer on closed connections
    
    This mimics the apparent behavior of writes on linux/amd64, in which a
    write on an already-closed connection silently succeeds — even if the
    connection has already been closed by the remote end — provided that
    the packet fits in the kernel's send buffer.
    
    I tested this by patching in CL 557437 and running the test on js/wasm
    and wasip1/wasm locally.
    
    Fixes #64317.
