    cmd/compile: fix bug with Inferred targs
    
    We were using the type from the wrong Node (the partially filled-in
    FUNCINST) rather than the original function node - which is pointed to
    by the OFUNCINST)) to set the final fully-substituted type of the
    OFUNCINST. So fixed the node reference. Also, added check so we don't do
    any work at all if the OFUNCINST already has all type args filled in.
    
    Added few extra cases to the test file issue48030.go, to cover
    fully-specified type args, partially inferred type args, and fully
    inferred type args.
    
    Fixes #48030
