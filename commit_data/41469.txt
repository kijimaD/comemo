    cmd/compile: adjust line numbering for type switch
    
    Two changes, one to cause the back end to not number ITab operations
    (these tend to disappear and are also followed by something more robust)
    and to explicitly unmark (as statements) all but the first bit of
    the code generated to implement a type switch.
