commit 0972096c5c2facec2d5c6db08a2df32684f41caa

    cmd/api: make api/next/* entries required, not optional
    
    We want the API check to catch if some API present in api/next/*
    files is no longer implemented in the tree, and report it in the
    same CL that is making the change (by failing loudly). Arguably
    this should've been the case since CL 315350, but I didn't notice
    it at the time. Do it now.
    
    For #43956.
