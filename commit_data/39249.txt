    doc: remove last pieces of advice to set GOROOT
    
    install.html still insisted that GOROOT must be set if a binary install
    of Go is set up in a custom directory. However, since 1.10, this has
    been unnecessary as the GOROOT will be found based on the location of
    the 'go' binary being run.
    
    Likewise, install-source.html includes an 'export GOROOT' line in a
    section that only talks about explicitly setting GOARCH and GOOS, which
    is optional. We don't want to have users think it is recommended to set
    GOROOT here either, so remove the unnecessary line.
