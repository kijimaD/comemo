    net/http: update bundled http2
    
    Updates x/net/http2 to git rev 6bdd4be4 for CL 23526:
    
      http2: GotFirstResponseByte hook should only fire once
    
    Also updated the trace hooks test to verify that all trace hooks are called
    exactly once except ConnectStart/End, which may be called multiple times (due
    to happy-eyeballs).
    
    Fixes #15777
