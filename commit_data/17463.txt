commit 0ba7ffe2897cd9771de172362e9edcb5f733cf1f
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    text/template: allow eq to take more than two arguments
    Based on an old suggestion by rsc, it compares the second
    and following arguments to the first.
    
    Unfortunately the code cannot be as pretty as rsc's original
    because it doesn't require identical types.
