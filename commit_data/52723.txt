    runtime: add BenchmarkMemclrRange
    
    This benchmark is added to test improvements in memclr_amd64.
    As it is stated in Intel Optimization Manual 15.16.3.3, AVX2-implemented
    memclr can produce a skewed result with the branch predictor being
    trained by the large loop iteration count.
    
    This benchmark generates sizes between some specified range. This should
    help to measure how memclr works when branch predictors may be incorrectly
    trained.
