    misc/cgo/test: skip TestCrossPackageTests on Android
    
    This test currently fails in the Android builders, with the message
            pkg_test.go:64: go test -short: exec: "go": executable file not found in $PATH
    (https://build.golang.org/log/39ec0da5bfb7793359e199cc8e358ca5a8257840)
    
    I was not able to test this change, because I can't get 'gomote
    create' to return an instance of anything Android. However, I will
    watch the build dashboard after submitting to verify that the fix
    works.
    
    Updates #30228
    
    Android appears to lack a 'go' command in the.
