    expvar: avoid conflict with user-defined "GET /" route.
    
    With the new routing style in go 1.22, declaring
    
        http.Handle("GET /", h)
    
    generates a conflict with route "/debug/vars" declared in the expvar
    package. You get an error such as:
    
    panic: pattern "GET /" (registered at ...) conflicts with pattern
    "/debug/vars" (registered at ...expvar.go:384): GET / matches fewer
    methods than /debug/vars, but has a more general path pattern
    
    This patch prevents that error.  Adding GET is correct because no other
    method makes sense with /debug/vars.
    
    We preserve the traditional behaviour when GODEBUG=httpmuxgo121=1 is
    specified.
    
    Fixes #65723
