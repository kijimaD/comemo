    runtime: fix crashing with foreign signal handlers on Darwin
    
    The dieFromSignal runtime function attempts to forward crashing
    signals to a signal handler registered before the runtime was
    initialized, if any. However, on Darwin, a special signal handler
    trampoline is invoked, even for non-Go signal handlers.
    
    Clear the crashing signal's handlingSig entry to ensure sigtramp
    forwards the signal.
    
    Fixes the darwin/386 builder.
