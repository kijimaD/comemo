    doc: update Code of Conduct wording and scope
    
    This change removes the punitive language and anonymous reporting mechanism
    from the Code of Conduct document. Read on for the rationale.
    
    More than a year has passed since the Go Code of Conduct was introduced.
    In that time, there have been a small number (<30) of reports to the Working Group.
    Some reports we handled well, with positive outcomes for all involved.
    A few reports we handled badly, resulting in hurt feelings and a bad
    experience for all involved.
    
    On reflection, the reports that had positive outcomes were ones where the
    Working Group took the role of advisor/facilitator, listening to complaints and
    providing suggestions and advice to the parties involved.
    The reports that had negative outcomes were ones where the subject of the
    report felt threatened by the Working Group and Code of Conduct.
    
    After some discussion among the Working Group, we saw that we are most
    effective as facilitators, rather than disciplinarians. The various Go spaces
    already have moderators; this change to the CoC acknowledges their authority
    and places the group in a purely advisory role. If an incident is
    reported to the group we may provide information to or make a
    suggestion the moderators, but the Working Group need not (and should not) have
    any authority to take disciplinary action.
    
    In short, we want it to be clear that the Working Group are here to help
    resolve conflict, period.
    
    The second change made here is the removal of the anonymous reporting mechanism.
    To date, the quality of anonymous reports has been low, and with no way to
    reach out to the reporter for more information there is often very little we
    can do in response. Removing this one-way reporting mechanism strengthens the
    message that the Working Group are here to facilitate a constructive dialogue.
