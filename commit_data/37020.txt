    runtime/pprof: fix incorrect assumption in TestMapping
    
    TestMapping assumed that there was only one mapping entry corresponding
    to /exe/main, but that is not always true.
    This CL changes the test logic to examine whether all referenced mappings
    are symbolized. Based on the result, the test determines whether the
    corresponding mapping entries' HasFunctions fields to be true or false.
    
    I initially attempted to create two mappings for referenced locations
    (one for symbolized and another for unsymbolized) as described in the
    TODO in proto.go as part of fixing this bug. But that change requires
    non-trivial modification in the upstream profile package so I decided
    to just fix the test for now.
    
    Fixes #25891
