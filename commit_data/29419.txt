    regexp: don't run slow benchmarks on race builders
    
    Shave 6.5 minutes off the *-race build time.
    
    The *-race builders run:
    
        go test -short -race -run=^$ -benchtime=.1s -cpu=4 $PKG
    
    ... for each package with benchmarks.
    
    The point isn't to measure the speed of the packages, but rather to
    see if there are any races. (which is why a benchtime of 0.1 seconds
    is used)
    
    But running in race mode makes things slower and our benchmarks aren't
    all very fast to begin with.
    
    The regexp benchmarks in race were taking over 6.5 minutes. With this
    CL, it's now 8 seconds.
    
    Updates #17104
