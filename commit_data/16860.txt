    runtime: more cgocallback_gofunc work
    
    Debugging the Windows breakage I noticed that SEH
    only exists on 386, so we can balance the two stacks
    a little more on amd64 and reclaim another word.
    
    Now we're down to just one word consumed by
    cgocallback_gofunc, having reclaimed 25% of the
    overall budget (4 words out of 16).
    
    Separately, fix windows/386 - the SEH must be on the
    m0 stack, as must the saved SP, so we are forced to have
    a three-word frame for 386. It matters much less for
    386, because there 128 bytes gives 32 words to use.
