    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: shrink commonly-used structs
    
    Replace the OnStack boolean in VarLoc with a flag bit in StackOffset.
    This doesn't get much memory savings since it's still 64-bit aligned,
    but does seem to help a bit anyway.
    
    Change liveSlot to fit into 16 bytes. Because nested structs still get
    padding, this required inlining it. Fortunately there's not much logic
    to copy.
