    runtime/internal/startlinetest: work around shared buildmode linking issue
    
    The runtime/internal/startlinetest package contains a call to a
    function defined in runtime_test. Generally this is fine as this
    package is only linked in for runtime_test. Except that for "go
    install -buildmode=shared std", which include all packages in std,
    including this test-only internal package. In this mode, the
    caller is included in the linking but the callee is not, causing
    linking error. Work around it by calling
    runtime_test.callerStartLine via a function pointer. The function
    pointer is only set in runtime_test. In the shared std build, the
    function pointer will not be set, and this is fine.
    
    Fixes #57334.
