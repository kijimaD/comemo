    html/template: document handling of namespaced and data- attributes
    
    Attributes with a namespace or a data- prefix are handled as if they
    had no namespace/data- prefix.
    
    There is also a special case, where attributes with a "xmlns" namespace
    are always treated as containing URLs.
    
    This could surprise users of the package, since this behaviour was not
    documented anywhere, so this change adds some documentation for all
    three cases.
    
    Fixes #12648

 For these internal escaping functions, if an action pipeline evaluates to
 a nil interface value, it is treated as though it were an empty string.
 
+Namespaced and data- attributes
+
+Attributes with a namespace are treated as if they had no namespace.
+Given the excerpt
+
+  <a my:href="{{.}}"></a>
+
+At parse time the attribute will be treated as if it were just "href".
+So at parse time the template becomes:
+
+  <a my:href="{{. | urlescaper | attrescaper}}"></a>
+
+Similarly to attributes with namespaces, attributes with a "data-" prefix are
+treated as if they had no "data-" prefix. So given
+
+  <a data-href="{{.}}"></a>
+
+At parse time this becomes
+
+  <a data-href="{{. | urlescaper | attrescaper}}"></a>
+
+If an attribute has both a namespace and a "data-" prefix, only the namespace
+will be removed when determining the context. For example
+
+  <a my:data-href="{{.}}"></a>
+
+This is handled as if "my:data-href" was just "data-href" and not "href" as
+it would be if the "data-" prefix were to be ignored too. Thus at parse
+time this becomes just
+
+  <a my:data-href="{{. | attrescaper}}"></a>
+
+As a special case, attributes with the namespace "xmlns" are always treated
+as containing URLs. Given the excerpts
+
+  <a xmlns:title="{{.}}"></a>
+  <a xmlns:href="{{.}}"></a>
+  <a xmlns:onclick="{{.}}"></a>
+
+At parse time they become:
+
+  <a xmlns:title="{{. | urlescaper | attrescaper}}"></a>
+  <a xmlns:href="{{. | urlescaper | attrescaper}}"></a>
+  <a xmlns:onclick="{{. | urlescaper | attrescaper}}"></a>
