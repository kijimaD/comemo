commit 0436a89a2c5afad41356dc1dff7c745cd30636a7

    spec: be more explicit about equivalence of empty string and absent field tags
    
    Note that the spec already makes that point with a comment in the very first
    example for struct field tags. This change is simply stating this explicitly
    in the actual spec prose.
    
    - gccgo and go/types already follow this rule
    - the current reflect package API doesn't distinguish between absent tags
      and empty tags (i.e., there is no discoverable difference)
    
    Fixes #15412.
