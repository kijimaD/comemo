    net, os, syscall: Plan 9: adjust error handling
    
    syscall: Use NewError for all system errors and introduce
            some new errors for compatibility with other packages
            and proper error handling in net. Also introduce
            Temporary and Timeout methods on ErrorString.
    
    net: Make errors from dial, accept, listen functions follow the
            OpError standard and discern whether the underlying
            error came from syscall. Since Plan 9 uses a correspondence
            between file and network operations, all system error
            reporting happens through the underlying file operation.
            In Go code, we go through package os for file operations,
            so there is another level of indirection in error types.
            This change allows us to compare the errors with those in
            package syscall, when appropriate.
    
    os: Just use the error string already present in package os,
            instead of calling out to package syscall.
