commit 795ff00df0f2e2eae44b50f33e2b63c23ec1a862
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 22 09:21:50 2011 -0800

    reflect: add a secret method to ArrayOrSliceType.
    It was observed that the interface was generic enough
    that several other types implemented it too.
    
    Fixes #1530.
