    net/rpc: clarify requirements for connections and codecs
    
    1. Connections and codecs need to be partially safe for concurrent use.
       Namely, read side is serialized by one mutex,
       and writing side is serialized by another.
       Current comment says that they need to be fully thread-safe,
       which makes the default implementations (gobClientCodec/gobServerCodec)
       non-conforming.
    
    2. Say that ServerCodec.Close can be called multiple times
       and must be idempotent. Server requires this and gobServerCodec
       accounts for this,  but the requirement is not documented.
