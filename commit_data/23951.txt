    doc: Mention contributor agreement immediately after Gerrit
    
    I walked through the steps for a contribution but ended up
    with an error when doing "git mail" because I didn't have a
    signed agreement.
    
    Added a section to check for or create one through Gerrit right
    after the user has created the account and logged in.
    
    Moved some info from copyright section to the new section.
