    compress/flate: test if results are deterministic
    
    This will test if deflate output is deterministic between two runs
    of the deflater, when write sizes differ.
    
    The deflater makes no official promises that results are
    deterministic between runs, but this is a good test to determine
    unintentional randomness.
    
    Note that this does not guarantee that results are deterministic
    across platforms nor that results will be deterministic between
    Go versions. This is also not guarantees we should imply.
