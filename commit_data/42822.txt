    net/mail: skip empty entries in parseAddressList
    
    RFC 5322 has a section 4.4 where it says that address-list could
    have "null" members: "That is, there could be two or more commas in
    such a list with nothing in between them, or commas at the beginning
    or end of the list." This change handles such a case so that mail
    clients using this method on actual email messages get a reasonable
    return value when they parse email.
    
    Fixes #36959
