    cmd/compile/internal/pgo: move pprof graph to internal package
    
    graph.go is a simplified fork of github.com/google/pprof/internal/graph,
    which is used as an intermediate data structure to construct the final
    graph exported by package pgo (IRGraph).
    
    Exporting both is a bit confusing as the former is unused outside of the
    package. Since the naming is also similar, move graph.go to its own
    package entirely.
