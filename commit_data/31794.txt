    runtime: clean up some silly allp loops
    
    Back in the day, allp was just a pointer to an array. As a result, the
    runtime has a few loops of the form:
    
        for i := 0; ; i++ {
            p := allp[i]
            if p == nil {
                break
            }
            ...
        }
    
    This is silly now because it requires that allp be one longer than the
    maximum possible number of Ps, but now that allp is in Go it has a
    length.
    
    Replace these with range loops.
