    [dev.link] cmd/link/internal/loader: speed up Loader.RelocVariant
    
    Remove some extra sanity-checking code from the loader's RelocVariant
    method, since it was yielding a slowdown of 1-2% linking kubernetes
    hyperkube (once again a reminder that relocation processing is a very
    performance-sensitive part of the linker).
