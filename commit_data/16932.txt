    runtime: cut struct Hmap back to 48-byte allocation
    
    struct Hmap is the header for a map value.
    
    CL 8377046 made flags a uint32 so that it could be updated atomically,
    but that bumped the struct to 56 bytes, which allocates as 64 bytes (on amd64).
    
    hash0 is initialized from runtime.fastrand1, which returns a uint32,
    so the top 32 bits were always zero anyway. Declare it as a uint32
    to reclaim 4 bytes and bring the Hmap size back down to a 48-byte allocation.
    
    Fixes #5237.
