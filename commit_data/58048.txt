    internal/sync: refactor HashTrieMap tests into per-op suites
    
    This change does a minor refactor of the HashTrieMap tests to be better
    organized into suites for each operation. It might be worthwhile to
    deduplicate some code in here, but it's also helpful to see exactly
    what's happening when something goes wrong.
