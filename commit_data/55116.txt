    cmd/compile/internal/pgo: add hint to missing start_line error
    
    Profiles only began adding Function.start_line in 1.20. If it is
    missing, add a hint to the error message that they may need to profile a
    build of the application built with a newer version of the toolchain.
    
    Technically profiles are not required to come from Go itself (e.g., they
    could be converted from perf), but in practice they most likely are.
    
    Fixes #57674.
