commit b58ecb11b0f43ae75e60f29c70fae4f981e54ca7
Author: Nigel Tao <nigeltao@golang.org>

    Fix inflate.go's decompressing of a fixed Huffman block that has
    length-distance pairs.
    
    The new test data was generated by "gzip shesells.txt", which is
    presumably what you (rsc) did before, for the other test cases in
    gunzip_test.go.
