commit f375b305c801515b587719490b4be0db1a66e20c

    crypto/x509: clarify that CheckSignatureFrom and CheckSignature are low-level APIs
    
    In particular, CheckSignatureFrom just can't check the path length
    limit, because it might be enforced above the parent.
    
    We don't need to document the supported signature algorithms for
    CheckSignatureFrom, since we document at the constants in what contexts
    they are allowed and not. That does leave CheckSignature ambiguous,
    though, because that function doesn't have an explicit context.
