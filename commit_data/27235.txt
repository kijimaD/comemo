    net/http: provide access to the listener address an HTTP request arrived on
    
    This adds a context key named LocalAddrContextKey (for now, see #15229) to
    let users access the net.Addr of the net.Listener that accepted the connection
    that sent an HTTP request. This is similar to ServerContextKey which provides
    access to the *Server. (A Server may have multiple Listeners)
    
    Fixes #6732
