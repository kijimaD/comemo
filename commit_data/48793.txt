    crypto/x509: don't create certs with negative serials
    
    Refuse to create certificates with negative serial numbers, as they
    are explicitly disallowed by RFC 5280.
    
    We still allow parsing certificates with negative serial numbers,
    because in the past there were buggy CA implementations which would
    produce them (although there are currently *no* trusted certificates
    that have this issue). We may want to revisit this decision if we can
    find metrics about the prevalence of this issue in enterprise settings.
