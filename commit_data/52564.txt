    cmd/compile: remove broken LEA "optimization"
    
    CL 440035 added rewrite rules to simplify "costly" LEA
    instructions, but the types in the rewrites were wrong and
    the code would go bad if the wrong-typed register was spilled.
    
    CL 482536 attempted to fix this by correcting the type in the
    rewrite, but that "fix" broke something on windows-amd64-race.
    
    Instead / for-now, remove the offending rewrite rules.
    
    Updates #21735.
    Fixes #59432.
