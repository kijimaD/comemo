    net: don't avoid resolving .local addresses
    
    .local addresses are used by things like Kubernetes and Weave DNS; Go
    should not avoid resolving them.
    
    This is a partial revert of https://golang.org/cl/21328 which was too
    strict of an interpretation of RFC 6762.
    
    Fixes #16739
