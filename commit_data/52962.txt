    [dev.unified] cmd/compile: avoid reflectType in ssagen
    
    This CL adds alternate code paths for the frontend to plumb through
    rtypes to package ssagen, so the latter doesn't have to use
    reflectType (which in general will only have access to shape types).
    
    Note: This CL doesn't yet plumb through the rtypes for variables that
    escape to the heap. However, those rtypes are only used for calling
    runtime.newobject, and the status quo as of Go 1.18 is already to use
    shape rtypes for most runtime.newobject calls. (Longer term though, I
    would like to get rid of shape rtypes altogether.)
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
    
    Updates #53276.
