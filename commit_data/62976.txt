    crypto/tls: handle client hello version too high
    
    If the client hello legacy version is >= TLS 1.3, and no
    supported_versions extension is sent, negotiate TLS 1.2 or lower when
    supported.
    
    On the topic of supported version negotiation RFC 8446 4.2.1 indicates
    TLS 1.3 implementations MUST send a supported_versions extension with
    a list of their supported protocol versions. The crypto/tls package
    enforces this when the client hello legacy version indicates TLS 1.3
    (0x0304), aborting the handshake with an alertMissingExtension alert if
    no supported_versions were received.
    
    However, section 4.2.1 indicates different behaviour should be used when
    the extension is not present and TLS 1.2 or prior are supported:
    
      If this extension is not present, servers which are compliant with
      this specification and which also support TLS 1.2 MUST negotiate
      TLS 1.2 or prior as specified in [RFC5246], even if
      ClientHello.legacy_version is 0x0304 or later.
    
    This commit updates the client hello processing logic to allow this
    behaviour. If no supported_versions extension was received we ignore the
    legacy version being >= TLS 1.3 and instead negotiate a lower supported
    version if the server configuration allows.
    
    This fix in turn allows enabling the BoGo ClientHelloVersionTooHigh,
    MinorVersionTolerance, and MajorVersionTolerance tests.
