    misc/android: rename to misc/go_android_exec, make go build work
    
    This makes it reasonable to "go build" from this directory by changing
    the name of the directory to a more reasonable name for the binary and
    dropping the unnecessary "ignore" build tag. The resulting binary
    doesn't *quite* have the necessary name for a Go exec wrapper because
    that needs to have the form, go_android_$GOARCH_exec, but it's close.
