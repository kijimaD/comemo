    websocket: tweak hybi ReadHandshake to supports Firefox implementation
    
    Firefox Websocket implementation send a "Connection: keep-alive, upgrade"
    header during the handshake (and as descripted on the last hybi draft
    the "Connection" header must include, but doesn't need to be equal to,
    "upgrade":
    
       '4. A "Connection" header field that includes the token "Upgrade",
        treated as an ASCII case-insensitive value.'
