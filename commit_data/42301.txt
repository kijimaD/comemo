    cmd/link: add new linker testpoint for "ld -r" host object
    
    This adds a new test that builds a small Go program with linked
    against a *.syso file that is the result of an "ld -r" link. The
    sysobj in question has multiple static symbols in the same section
    with the same name, which triggered a bug in the loader in -newobj
    mode.
    
    Updates #35779.
