    crypto/x509: fix panic in TestEnvVars, improve style
    
    This panic happens when the test fails due to the returned number of
    certificates (r.certs) being less than expected by test case (tc.cns).
    When i == len(r.certs) in the for loop, r.certs[i] will cause an index
    out of range panic.
    
    Also improve readability, consistency and style of the code. Use the
    more common "got x, want y" pattern. See https://golang.org/s/style#useful-test-failures
    for reference (and grep codebase for most common occurrences). Add a
    comment, and remove blank line separating two blocks that are both
    related to verifying that len(r.certs) == len(tc.cns). This should
    help with readability.
    
    Remove space after colon in call to t.Fatal, since it adds spaces
    between its arguments.
    
    Fixes #20801.
