    cmd/go, go/build: support .m files
    
    go/build is changed to list the .m files in a package, and match them for build constraints, adding them to a new field: Package.MFiles.
    
    The go tool is changed to support building .m files and linking in the results during CGO and SWIG builds. This means packages that create a C interface to calls Objective-C code from go are now go-gettable without producing and distributing .syso files. This change is analogous to the one in Go 1.2 made to support C++ built code.
    
    This change doesn't support .mm files (Objective C++).
    
    Also added support for these MFiles to go list's -json mode.
    
    Fixes #6536.
