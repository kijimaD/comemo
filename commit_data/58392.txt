    fmt: add more function and allocation tests
    
    This is part of a series of CLs that aim to reduce how often interface
    arguments escape for the print functions in fmt.
    
    Currently, method values are one of two reasons reflect.Value.Interface
    always escapes its reflect.Value.
    
    Our later CLs modify behavior around method values, so we add some tests
    of function formatting (including method values) to help reduce the
    chances of breaking behavior later.
    
    We also add in some allocation tests focused on interface arguments for
    the print functions. These currently do not show any improvements
    compared to Go 1.21.
    
    These tests were originally in a later CL in our stack (CL 528538),
    but we split them out into this CL and moved them earlier in the stack.
    
    Updates #8618
