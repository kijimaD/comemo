    runtime: throw if the runtime panics with out of bounds index
    
    If the runtime code panics due to a bad index or slice expression,
    then throw instead of panicing. This will skip calls to recover and dump
    the entire runtime stack trace. The runtime should never panic due to
    an out of bounds index, and this will help with debugging if it does.
