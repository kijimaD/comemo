    cmd/go: limit GOMAXPROCS in TestScript/test_fuzz_.*
    
    This limits the throughput and resource consumption of the fuzz
    workers in the tests, which also reduces the likelihood of running out
    of address space in the fuzz coordinator during the test.
    
    (Ideally the coordinator should not be limited by address space;
    this just works around the failure mode in the tests for now.)
    
    For #65434.
