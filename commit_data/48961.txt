    cmd/compile: fix loopreschedchecks for regabi
    
    The loopreschedchecks pass (GOEXPERIMENT=preemptibleloops) had
    bit-rotted in two ways because of the regabi experiment:
    
    1. The call to goschedguarded was generating a pre-regabi StaticCall.
       This CL updates it to construct a new-style StaticCall.
    
    2. The mem finder did not account for tuples or results containing a
       mem. This caused it to construct phis that were supposed to thread
       the mem into the added blocks, but they could instead thread a
       tuple or results containing a mem, causing things to go wrong
       later. This CL updates the mem finder to add an op to select out
       the mem if it finds the last live mem in a block is a tuple or
       results. This isn't ideal since we'll deadcode out most of these,
       but it's the easiest thing to do and this is just an experiment.
    
    Tested by running the runtime tests. Ideally we'd have a real test for
    this, but I don't think it's worth the effort for code that clearly
    hasn't been enabled by anyone for at least a year.
