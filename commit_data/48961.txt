    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: functions to create GC shape types/names for a concrete type
    
    Created functions to create GC shape type and names, based on a proposal
    from Keith. Kept unsigned and signed integer types as different, since
    they have different shift operations.
    
    Included adding in alignment fields where padding is
    required between fields, even though that seems like it will be fairly
    uncommon to use.
    
    Added some extra unusual struct typeparams (for testing the gcshape
    names/types) in index.go test.
