    cmd/asm: add support for the rest of loong64 unary bitops
    
    All remaining unary bitop instructions in the LoongArch v1.00 base ISA
    are added with this change.
    
    While at it, add the missing W suffix to the current CLO/CLZ names. They
    are not used anywhere as far as we know, so no breakage is expected.
    Also, stop reusing SLL's instruction format for simplicity, in favor of
    a new but trivial instruction format case.
    
    This patch is a copy of CL 477717.
