    runtime/trace: fix TestTraceSymbolize networking
    
    We use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost in Go networking tests.
    The reporter of #11774 has localhost defined to be 120.192.83.162,
    for reasons unknown.
    
    Also, if TestTraceSymbolize calls Fatalf (for example because Listen
    fails) then we need to stop the trace for future tests to work.
    See failure log in #11774.
    
    Fixes #11774.
