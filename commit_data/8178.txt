    runtime: skip functions with no lines when building src line table
    
    Avoid getting out of synch when a function, such as main.init,
    has no associated line number information.  Without this the
    function before main.init can skip the PC all the way to the
    next function, which will cause the next function's line table
    to be associated with main.init, and leave subsequent
    functions with the wrong line numbers.
