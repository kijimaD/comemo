    go/doc: set receiver type position for embedded methods
    
    This was a bug that didn't manifest itself before CL 7674044;
    but with that CL and without this fix, the go/doc tests fail.
    (The bug fixed by 7674044 and the bug fixed here cancelled
    each other out w/ respect to the go/doc tests).
