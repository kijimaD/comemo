    doc/go1.13: make cmd/go paragraphs more concise
    
    Looking at the live release notes on tip.golang.org, the Modules
    section is much more verbose than the other sections.
    
    To some extent that's to be expected, but too much detail in the
    release notes might discourage folks from consulting the actual
    documentation. Ensure that topics have clear links and omit
    unnecessary details.
