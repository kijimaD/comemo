commit 54111a5893cf3a1de6f79729832c3ad9bb1a193b
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 24 14:33:30 2014 -0700

    fmt: document and fix the handling of precision for strings and byte slices
    Previous behavior was undocumented and inconsistent. Now it is documented
    and consistent and measures the input size, since that makes more sense
    when talking about %q and %x. For %s the change has no effect.
    
    Fixes #8151.
