    net/http: document and test behavior of ServeMux with ports
    
    Beginning on Go 1.9, ServeMux has been dropping the port number from the Host
    header and in the path pattern. This commit explicitly mentions the change in
    behavior and adds a simple test case to ensure consistency.
    
    Fixes #23351.
