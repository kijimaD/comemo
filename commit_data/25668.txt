commit f762d0d22070ba57dbcd74a7cc99cb124dabe667

    A+C: add Steve Newman (Google CLA)
    
    Steve Newman (Google CLA) was missing from the CONTRIBUTORS file,
    presumably because his old commits (made prior to Go being open
    source) in SVN/perforce were imported into hg/git later as
    "devnull@localhost", which probably didn't match anything, and we
    didn't start tracking CLA contributions prior to the Go
    open source release.
    
    As a fun historical note, the initial HTTP client from Steve:
    https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f315fb3
