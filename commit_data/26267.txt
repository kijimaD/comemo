    cmd/compile: fix no-opt build after moving decomposing user functions
    
    decompose-builtin pass requires an opt pass, but -N disables
    late-opt, the only opt pass (out of two) that happens
    after decompose-builtin.  This CL enables both 'opt' and 'late opt'
    passes. The extra compile time for 'late opt' in negligible
    since most rewrites were already done in the first 'opt'
    (also measured before). We should put some effort in splitting the
    generic rules into required and optional.
    
    Also update generic.rules comments about lowering
    of StringMake and SliceMake.
    
    Tested with GO_GCFLAGS=-N ./all.bash
