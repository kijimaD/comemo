    cmd/dist: Plan 9 build needs an additional include path
    cmd/cc: bv.c imports libc.h twice
    
    When using the Plan 9 compiler, the invocation
    
            #include <../ld/textflag.h>
    
    works for the toolchain, but not for the MACH library.
    
    Module cmd/cc/bv.c includes libc.h and "cc.h", which in
    turn also includes libc.h.  In the Plan 9 context, this
    causes a number of duplicate definitions.
