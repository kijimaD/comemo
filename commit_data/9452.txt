    ld: handle Plan 9 ar format
    
    The Go version has 64 character long section names; originally,
    in Plan 9, the limit was 16.  To provide compatibility, this
    change allows the input length to be either the target length
    or the earlier option.  The section name is extended with spaces
    where required.
    
    This has been tested to work without regressions in the
    Go environment, testing the older alternative has not been
    possible yet.
