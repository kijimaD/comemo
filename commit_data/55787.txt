    net/http: remove Content-Length header in http.Error
    
    Error replies to a request with an error message and HTTP code.
    Delete any preexisting Content-Length header before writing the header;
    if a Content-Length is present, it's probably for content that the
    caller has given up on writing.
    
    For #50905
