    crypto/x509: don't include empty additional primes in PKCS#1 private key.
    
    asn1 didn't have an omitempty tag, so the list of additional primes in
    an RSA private key was serialised as an empty SEQUENCE, even for
    version 1 structures. This tripped up external code that didn't handle
    v2.
