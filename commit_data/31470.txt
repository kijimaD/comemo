    cmd/dist: spin up fewer test dir runners
    
    5 shards, each of which spins up NumCPU processes,
    each of which is running at GOMAXPROCS=NumCPU,
    is too much for one machine. It makes my laptop unusable.
    
    It might also be in part responsible for test flakes
    that require a moderately responsive system,
    like #18589 (backedge scheduling) and #19276 (locklinear).
    
    It's possible that Go should be a better neighbor in general;
    that's #17969. In the meantime, fix this corner of the world.
    
    Builders snapshot the world and run shards on different
    machines, so keeping sharding high for them is good.
    
    This is a partial reversion of CL 18199.
    
    Fixes #20141.
