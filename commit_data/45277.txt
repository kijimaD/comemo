    runtime: don't run TestCrashDumpsAllThreads in parallel
    
    It sometimes seems to time out on slow systems, perhaps due to
    being run at the same time as a lot of other work.
    
    Also move the code to testdata/testprog, so that we don't have to
    build it separately.
    
    I hope that this
    Fixes #35356
