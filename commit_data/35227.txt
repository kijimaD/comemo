    runtime: fix time.Now on Sierra and older
    
    CL 67332 created the fast no-syscall path for time.Now in High Sierra
    but managed to break Sierra and older by forcing them into the slow
    syscall path: the version check based on commpage version was wrong.
    
    This CL uses the Darwin version number instead.
    
    The assembly diff is noisy because many variables had to be
    renamed, but the only actual change is the version check.
    
    Fixes #23419.
