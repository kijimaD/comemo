    runtime: recheck GC trigger before actually starting GC
    
    Currently allocation checks the GC trigger speculatively during
    allocation and then triggers the GC without rechecking. As a result,
    it's possible for G 1 and G 2 to detect the trigger simultaneously,
    both enter startGC, G 1 actually starts GC while G 2 gets preempted
    until after the whole GC cycle, then G 2 immediately starts another GC
    cycle even though the heap is now well under the trigger.
    
    Fix this by re-checking the GC trigger non-speculatively just before
    actually kicking off a new GC cycle.
    
    This contributes to #11911 because when this happens, we definitely
    don't finish the background sweep before starting the next GC cycle,
    which can significantly delay the start of concurrent scan.
