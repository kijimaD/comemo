    runtime/coverage: avoid non-test coverage profiles in test report helper
    
    When walking through the set of coverage data files generated from a
    "go test -cover" run, it's possible to encounter pods (clumps of data
    files) that were generated by a run from an instrumented Go tool (for
    example, cmd/compile). Add a guard to the test reporting code to
    ensure that it only processes files created by the currently running
    test.
    
    Fixes #57924.
