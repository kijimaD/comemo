    archive/tar: perform test for hole-detection on specific builders
    
    The test for hole-detection is heavily dependent on whether the
    OS and underlying FS provides support for it.
    Even on Linux, which has support for SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA,
    the underlying filesystem may not have support for it.
    In order to avoid an ever-changing game of whack-a-mole,
    we whitelist the specific builders that we expect the test to pass on.
    
    Updates #21964
