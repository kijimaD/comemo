    compress/bzip2: refactor unit tests
    
    Over the years as more bugs were discovered with the bzip2 library,
    new Tests were appended the unit tests and the tests became gnarly.
    
    Clean up the tests to be more consistent with modern Go style in
    addition to coalescing common tests into a general version that
    iterates over a list of input/output pairs. This has the advantage that
    the input, output, and test code are all in the same area, rather than
    being sprawled around the test file.
    
    There is no loss of test coverage.
