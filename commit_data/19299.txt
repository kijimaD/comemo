    net: drop flakey TestDialFailPDLeak
    
    TestDialFailPDLeak was created for testing runtime-integrated netwrok
    poller stuff and used during Go 1.2 development cycle. Unfortunately
    it's still flakey because it depends on MemStats of runtime, not
    pollcache directly, and MemStats accounts and revises its own stats
    occasionally.
    
    For now the codepaths related to runtime-intergrated network poller
    are pretty stable, so removing this test case never suffers us.
    
    Fixes #6553.
