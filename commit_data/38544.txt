    internal/trace: add "per-P" MMU analysis
    
    The current MMU analysis considers all Ps together, so if, for
    example, one of four Ps is blocked, mutator utilization is 75%.
    However, this is less useful for understanding the impact on
    individual goroutines because that one blocked goroutine could be
    blocked for a very long time, but we still appear to have good
    utilization.
    
    Hence, this introduces a new flag that does a "per-P" analysis where
    the utilization of each P is considered independently. The MMU is then
    the combination of the MMU for each P's utilization function.
