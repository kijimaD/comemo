    cmd/compile: ensure first instruction of function is stmt
    
    In gdb, "b f" gets confused if the first instruction of "f"
    is not marked as a statement in the DWARF line table.
    
    To ensure gdb is not confused, move the first statement
    marker in "f" to its first instruction.
    
    The screwy-looking conditional for "what's the first
    instruction with a statement marker" will become simpler in
    the future.
    
    Fixes #24695.
