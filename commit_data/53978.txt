    net/http: make DefaultTransport docs about HTTP proxy consistent
    
    The changes improve the documentation for DefaultTransport, making
    the style with how the HTTP proxy environment variables are being
    referred to, consistent with the rest of the project's
    documentation.
    
    Also mention HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, as suggested in #32649.
