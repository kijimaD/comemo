    go/types, types2: refactor assignVars
    
    Rather than using exprList and handle all cases together, split
    apart the cases of n:n assignments and the cases of n:1 assignments.
    For the former, the lhs types may (in a future CL) be used to infer
    types on the rhs. This is a preparatory step.
    
    Because the two cases are handled separately, the code is longer
    (but also more explicit).
    
    Some test cases were adjusted to avoifd (legitimate, but previously
    supressed) "declared but not used" errors.
