    cmd/compile: randomize value order in block for testing
    
    A little bit of compiler stress testing. Randomize the order
    of the values in a block before every phase. This randomization
    makes sure that we're not implicitly depending on that order.
    
    Currently the random seed is a hash of the function name.
    It provides determinism, but sacrifices some coverage.
    Other arrangements are possible (env var, ...) but require
    more setup.
    
    Fixes #20178
