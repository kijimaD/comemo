    misc/cgo/testcarchive: avoid possible pthread_create race
    
    The old code assumed that the thread ID set by pthread_create would be
    available in the newly created thread.  While that is clearly true
    eventually, it is not necessarily true immediately.  Rather than try to
    pass down the thread ID, just call pthread_self in the created thread.
    
    Fixes #15576 (I hope).
