    cmd/go/testdata/script: add darwin skips for selected buildrepro tests
    
    Skip two build reproducibility tests (build_issue48319 and
    build_plugin_reproducible) on Darwin if GO_BUILDER_NAME is set until
    issue 64947 can be resolved; on the LUCI darwin longtest builder the
    more contemporary version of Xcode is doing things that are unfriendly
    to Go's build reproducibility.
    
    For #64947.
