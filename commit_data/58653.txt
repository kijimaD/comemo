    runtime: don't hold trace.lock over semrelease in readTrace0
    
    semrelease may unblock a goroutine, but the act of unblocking a
    goroutine may emit an event, which in turn may try to acquire trace.lock
    again.
    
    It's safe to release trace.lock in readTrace0 for this because all of
    the state (one variable) it uses under the lock will be recomputed when
    it reacquires the lock. There's also no other synchronization
    requirement to hold trace.lock. This is just a mistake.
