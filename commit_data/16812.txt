    runtime: disable preemption during deferreturn
    
    Deferreturn is synthesizing a new call frame.
    It must not be interrupted between copying the args there
    and fixing up the program counter, or else the stack will
    be in an inconsistent state, one that will confuse the
    garbage collector.
