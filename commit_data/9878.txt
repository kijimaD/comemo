commit 9a8da9d4999f53fa4487cf3e36c3e5bc59fd6fee

    exp/norm: LastBoundary is used in preparation for an append operation. It seems
    therefore unlikely that there is a good use for its string version
    LastBoundaryInString. Yet, the implemenation of this method would complicate
    things a bit as it would require the introduction for another interface and
    some duplication of code. Removing it seems a better choice.
