    net/http: add support for SameSite option in http.Cookie
    
    The same-site cookie attribute prevents a cookie from being sent along with
    cross-site requests. The main goal is mitigate the risk of cross-origin
    information leakage and provides some protection against cross-site request
    forgery attacks.
    
    This change adds the option to http.Cookie so it can be stored and
    passed to HTTP clients.
    
    Spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00
    
    Fixes #15867
