    runtime: eliminate memstats.heap_reachable
    
    We used to compute an estimate of the reachable heap size that was
    different from the marked heap size. This ultimately caused more
    problems than it solved, so we pulled it out, but memstats still has
    both heap_reachable and heap_marked, and there are some leftover TODOs
    about the problems with this estimate.
    
    Clean this up by eliminating heap_reachable in favor of heap_marked
    and deleting the stale TODOs.
