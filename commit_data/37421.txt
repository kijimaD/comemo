    cmd/go: fix detection of unexpected files in downloaded zips
    
    A bug in the old code was indirectly causing a confusing print,
    but CL 131635 fixed the print instead of the surrounding code.
    Fix the surrounding code, restore the old print, and test that the
    error is actually reported (it was being ignored in a direct go get
    but displaying in go build).
