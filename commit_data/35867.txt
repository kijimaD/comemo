    cmd/compile: keep autos whose address reaches a phi
    
    If the address of an auto reaches a phi then any further stores to
    the pointer represented by the phi probably need to be kept. This
    is because stores to the other arguments to the phi may be visible
    to the program.
    
    Fixes #26153.
