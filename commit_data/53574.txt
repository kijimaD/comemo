    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: remove the transition from $0 to ZR
    
    Previously we convert $0 to the ZR register for some reasons, which causes
    two problems:
    1. Confusion, the special case of the ZR register needs to be considered
    when dealing with constants. For encoding, some places we encode ZR, and
    some places we encode $0, although we have converted $0 to ZR.
    2. Unexpected instruction format. All instructions that support ZR register
    operands can be replaced by $0.
    
    This patch removes this conversion. Note that this patch may cause previously
    unintendedly supported instruction formats to no longer be supported.
