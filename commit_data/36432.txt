    cmd/compile: add initial README
    
    As a follow-up to the first README for cmd/compile/internal/ssa.
    
    Since this is the parent package for all the compiler packages, this
    README serves as an overview of the compiler and its packages. As more
    READMEs are added for specific parts with more detail, such as ssa's,
    they can be linked from this one.
    
    Thanks to Iskander Sharipov, Josh Bleecher Snyder, Matthew Dempsky,
    Alberto Donizetti, and Robert Griesemer for helping with all the details
    in this document.
