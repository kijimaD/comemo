    time: strip monotonic time in t.Round, t.Truncate
    
    The original analysis of the Go corpus assumed that these
    stripped monotonic time. During the design discussion we
    decided to try not stripping monotonic time here, but existing
    code works better if we do.
    
    See the discussion on golang.org/issue/18991 for more details.
    
    For #18991.
