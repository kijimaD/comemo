    net/http: be more conservative about enabling http2 on Transports
    
    For now, don't enable http2 when Transport.TLSConfig != nil.
    See background in #14275.
    
    Also don't enable http2 when ExpectContinueTimeout is specified for
    now, in case somebody depends on that functionality. (It is not yet
    implemented in http2, and was only just added to net/http too in Go
    1.6, so nobody would be setting it yet).
    
    Updates #14275
