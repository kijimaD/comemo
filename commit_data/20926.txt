    runtime: generate windows callback list with go generate
    
    This is the last system-dependent file written by cmd/dist.
    They are all now written by go generate.
    
    cmd/dist is not needed to start building package runtime
    for a different system anymore.
    
    Now all the generated files can be assumed generated, so
    delete the clumsy hacks in cmd/api.
    
    Re-enable api check in run.bash.
