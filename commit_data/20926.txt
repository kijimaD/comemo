    syscall: fix ParseRoutingSockaddr with unexpected submessages
    
    No easy way to test (would have to actually trigger some routing
    events from kernel) but the code is clearly wrong as written.
    If the header says there is a submessage, we need to at least
    skip over its bytes, not just continue to the next iteration.
    
    Fixes #8203.
