    os/user: speed up Current on Windows
    
    [This is a roll-forward of CL 597255, which had to be rolled back
    because it broke the windows-arm64 builder, whose current user display
    name is unavailable. This new CL fixes the issue by reintroducing the
    historical behavior of falling back to the user name instead of
    returning an error].
    
    user.Current is slow on Windows sessions connected to an Active
    Directory domain. This is because it uses Windows APIs that do RPC
    calls to the domain controller, such as TranslateAccountW and
    NetUserGetInfo.
    
    This change speeds up user.Current by using the GetUserNameEx API
    instead, which is already optimized for retrieving the current user
    name in different formats.
    
    These are the improvements I see with the new implementation:
