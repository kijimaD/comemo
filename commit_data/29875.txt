    runtime: skip floating point hardware check on Android
    
    CL 33652 removed the fake auxv for Android, and replaced it with
    a /proc/self/auxv fallback. When /proc/self/auxv is unreadable,
    however, hardware capabilities detection won't work and the runtime
    will mistakenly think that floating point hardware is unavailable.
    
    Fix this by always assuming floating point hardware on Android.
    
    Manually tested on a Nexus 5 running Android 6.0.1. I suspect the
    android/arm builder has a readable /proc/self/auxv and therefore
    does not trigger the failure mode.
