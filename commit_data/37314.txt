    cmd/cgo: don't report inconsistency error for incomplete typedef
    
    In CLs 122575 and 123177 the cgo tool started explicitly looking up
    typedefs. When there are two Go files using import "C", and the first
    one has an incomplete typedef and the second one has a complete
    version of the same typedef, then we will now record a version of the
    first typedef which will not match the recorded version of the second
    typedef, producing an "inconsistent definitions" error. Fix this by
    silently merging incomplete typedefs with complete ones.
    
    Fixes #26430
