    crypto/tls: add a SignatureScheme type.
    
    The SignatureAndHashAlgorithm from TLS 1.2[1] is being changed to
    SignatureScheme in TLS 1.3[2]. (The actual values are compatible
    however.)
    
    Since we expect to support TLS 1.3 in the future, we're already using
    the name and style of SignatureScheme in the recently augmented
    ClientHelloInfo. As this is public API, it seems that SignatureScheme
    should have its own type and exported values, which is implemented in
    this change.
