    doc/contribute: add examples for finding issues on the issue tracker
    
    For contributors looking for new issues to contribute to it can be
    difficult to find issues that need a fix and don't already have a fix
    being considered. There are several labels that help guide the way
    already, like `NeedsFix`, `HelpWanted`. But many issues with this label
    will already have a CL. For new contributors this can be especially
    difficult.
    
    Fixes #26494
