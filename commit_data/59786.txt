    runtime: reduced struct sizes found via pahole
    
    During my research of pahole with Go structs, I've found couple of
    structs in runtime/ pkg where we can reduce several structs' sizes
    highligted by pahole tool which detect byte holes and paddings.
    
    Overall, there are 80 bytes reduced.
