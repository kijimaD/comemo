    os: remove useless if from Wait on unix
    
    Back in the day, Wait used to accept options argument.
    
    CL 4962042 fixed the issue of setting process.done flag when WNOHANG
    option was used.
    
    Later, CL 5688046 removed options argument from Wait, but did not remove
    pid1 != 0 check which was meant to be used with WNOHANG only.
    
    Remove the check, which is useless and also confusing.
