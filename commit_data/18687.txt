    go/misc/makerelease: pin go-tour repo to a specific revision
    
    We're about to commit some wide-sweeping changes to the go-tour and I
    would rather not include them in Go 1.2.1, which is due in the next
    week or so.
    
    Also fix the makerelease tool; it has been broken since it was
    renamed from bindist.
