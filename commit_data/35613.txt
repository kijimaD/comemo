    archive/tar: remove loop label from reader
    
    CL 14624 introduced this label. At that time,
    the switch-case had a break to label statement which made this necessary.
    But now, the code no longer has a break statement and it directly returns.
    
    Hence, it is no longer necessary to have a label.
