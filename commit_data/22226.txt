commit 621d75999f37a5f358c94d6e467b4fe93a377b46

    all: mv 5a old5a and so on
    
    This CL will break any uses of 'go tool 5a' etc.
    That is intentional.
    Code that invokes an assembler directly should be updated to use go tool asm.
    
    We plan to keep the old5a around for bit-for-bit verification during
    the release testing phase, but we plan to remove those tools for the
    actual release. Renaming the directory now makes sure that lingering
    references to 'go tool 5a' will be caught, changed to use asm, and
    tested during the release evaluation.
