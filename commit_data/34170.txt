    cmd/compile/internal: decouple scope tracking from location lists
    
    We're trying to enable location lists by default, and it's easier to do
    that if we don't have to worry about scope tracking at the same time.
    We can evaluate their performance impact separately.
    
    However, that does mean that "err" is ambiguous in the test case, so
    rename it to err2 for now.
