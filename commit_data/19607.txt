    spec: receiver declaration is just a parameter declaration
    
    This CL removes the special syntax for method receivers and
    makes it just like other parameters. Instead, the crucial
    receiver-specific rules (exactly one receiver, receiver type
    must be of the form T or *T) are specified verbally instead
    of syntactically.
    
    This is a fully backward-compatible (and minor) syntax
    relaxation. As a result, the following syntactic restrictions
    (which are completely irrelevant) and which were only in place
    for receivers are removed:
    
    a) receiver types cannot be parenthesized
    b) receiver parameter lists cannot have a trailing comma
    
    The result of this CL is a simplication of the spec and the
    implementation, with no impact on existing (or future) code.
    
    Noteworthy:
    
    - gc already permits a trailing comma at the end of a receiver
      declaration:
    
      func (recv T,) m() {}
    
      This is technically a bug with the current spec; this CL will
      legalize this notation.
    
    - gccgo produces a misleading error when a trailing comma is used:
    
      error: method has multiple receivers
    
      (even though there's only one receiver)
    
    - Compilers and type-checkers won't need to report errors anymore
      if receiver types are parenthesized.
    
    Fixes #4496.
