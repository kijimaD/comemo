    net: disable TestDNSThreadLimit even in non-short mode by default
    
    TestDNSThreadLimit creates tons of DNS queries and it occasionally
    causes an unintentional traffic jam and/or crash of some virtual
    machine software, especially its builtin networking stuff.
    
    We can run TestDNSThreadLimit with -dnsflood flag instead.
