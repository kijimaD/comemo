    cmd/compile,cmd/link: move to DWARF5-style range lists
    
    This patch updates the compiler to generate DWARF5-style range lists
    (e.g. entries that feed into .debug_rnglists) as opposed to
    DWARF4-style range lists (which wind up in .debug_ranges). The DWARF5
    format is much more compact, and can make indirect references to text
    address via the .debug_addr section for further space savings.
    
    Updates #26379.
