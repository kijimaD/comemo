    go/doc: use correct escaper for URL
    
    Despite the name, URL escaping is for a small subpiece of the URL only.
    This particular URL is being emitted in an <a href=""> tag and in that
    context it should be HTML escaped, not URL escaped.
    
    In addition to fixing a bug, this change cuts a dependency chain
    from go/doc to net, clearing the way for use of cgo
    (which imports go/doc) during the compilation of package net.
