    archive/tar: make check for hole detection support more liberal
    
    On most Unix OSes, lseek reports EINVAL when lacking SEEK_HOLE support.
    However, there are reports that ENOTTY is reported instead.
    Rather than tracking down every possible errno that may be used to
    represent "not supported", just treat any non-nil error as meaning
    that there is no support. This is the same strategy taken by the
    GNU and BSD tar tools.
    
    Fixes #21958
