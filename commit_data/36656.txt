    go/types: fix scope printing (debugging support)
    
    Printing of scopes was horribly wrong: If a scope contained
    no object declarations, it would abort printing even if the
    scope had children scopes. Also, the line breaks were not
    inserted consistently. The actual test case (ExampleScope)
    was incorrect as well.
    
    Fixed and simplified printing, and adjusted example which
    tests the printing output.
