    math/rand: deprecate Seed
    
    Programs that call Seed and then expect a specific sequence
    of results from the global random source (using functions such as Int)
    can be broken when a dependency changes how much it consumes
    from the global random source. To avoid such breakages, programs
    that need a specific result sequence should use NewRand(NewSource(seed))
    to obtain a random generator that other packages cannot access.
    
    Fixes #56319.
