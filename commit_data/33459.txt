    [dev.boringcrypto] runtime/race: move TestRaceIssue5567 from sha1 to crc32
    
    If we substitute a SHA1 implementation where the entirety of the
    reading of the buffer is done in assembly (or C called from cgo),
    then the race detector cannot observe the race.
    
    Change to crc32 with a fake polynomial, in the hope that it will
    always be handled by Go code, not optimized assembly or cgo calls.
