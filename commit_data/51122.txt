    cmd/compile/internal/pgo: use a slice for locations
    
    Currently locations are stored in a map and looked up by ID from
    the map. The IDs are usually small sequential integers (the Go
    pprof CPU profiles are so). Using a slice is more efficient (with
    a fallback map to handle weirdly large IDs).
