    go/types: gotype to always report the same first error now
    
    The old code may have reported different errors given an
    erroneous package depending on the order in which files
    were parsed concurrently. The new code always reports
    errors in "file order", independent of processing order.
    
    Also:
    - simplified parsing code and internal concurrency control
    - removed -seq flag which didn't really add useful functionality
