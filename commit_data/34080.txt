    go/parser: improved error message for unexpected literals
    
    R=go1.11
    
    This is a follow up for #11377 which reported that an error like
    
    /tmp/xx.go:9:6: expected '(', found 'IDENT' F1
    
    shouldn't print 'IDENT', as it's just an internal detail.
    The relevant change wasn't made in the original fix, so here it is.
    
    For #11377.
