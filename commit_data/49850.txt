    runtime: move trace locks to the leaf of the lock graph
    
    Now that trace.lock cannot be held over a stack split, we can move
    that lock and traceStackTab to the leaf of the lock graph. We add a
    couple edges to STACKGROW that were previously passing through trace.
    
    Fixes #53979.
