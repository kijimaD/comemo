    net/http: Don't set Content-Length: -1 when responding to a POST
    
    Fixes an issue where Response.Write writes out a Content-Length: -1
    header when the corresponding Request is a POST or PUT and the
    ContentLength was not previously set.
    
    This was encountered when using httputil.DumpResponse
    to write out the response from a server that responded to a PUT
    request with no Content-Length header. The dumped output is
    thus invalid.
