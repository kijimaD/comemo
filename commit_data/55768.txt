    runtime: implement high resolution timer on windows arm/arm64
    
    This CL moves the usleep2HighRes from assembly to good old Go.
    This is safe because since CL 288793 usleep is always called with
    a g, else one wold have to call usleep_no_g. This condition was
    not enforced when high resolution timers were first implemented
    on Windows (CL 248699), so the implementation was done in assembly.
    
    Other than removing a bunch of obscure assembly code, this CL makes
    high resolution timers work on windows arm/arm64 by free, as the
    system calls are the same in all windows platforms.
