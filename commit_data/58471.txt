    context: use "canceled" in docs to refer to timed-out contexts
    
    In documentation, we've usually but not always referred to a
    context with a closed Done channel as "done" rather than
    "canceled", to avoid ambiguity between a context canceled
    by calling a CancelFunc and one past its deadline.
    
    This actually adds ambiguity, however, since it's common to
    see references to a "canceled context" that are intended to
    cover contexts past their deadline. If you see "function F
    returns if its context is canceled", you can reasonably
    assume that F will return if its context passes its
    deadline, unless something says otherwise.
    
    Update the context package docs to explicitly state that
    a context is canceled when its deadline passes. Drop references
    to contexts becoming "done" and just use "canceled" throughout.
    
    Fixes #70945
