    cmd/compile: changed representation of typeparam bound in types1
    
    Especially with typesets, we should be able to fully represent a
    typeparam bound as just another type (actually an interface type).
    Change the representation of a typeparam in types1 to include a bound,
    which is just a type. Changed the signature for NewTypeParam() to take a
    sym, and not a package, since we always set the sym (name) of the
    typeparam when creating it. No need for an extra pkg field in Typeparam.
    
    Also added index field in the types1 representation of typeparam. This
    is especially needed to correctly export the typeparam, and re-import it
    as a types2 type (which requires the index to be set correctly).
