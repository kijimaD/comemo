    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: delete overflow checking, make labels function-scoped
    
    The overflow checking was causing more problems than it was avoiding,
    so get rid of it. But because arithmetic is done with uint64s, to simplify
    dealing with large constants, complain about right shift and divide with
    huge numbers to avoid ambiguity about signed shifts.
