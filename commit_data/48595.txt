    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: sort iface fields before expansion
    
    For toolstash -cmp compatibility with types2, we also need to sort
    fields (or at least the embedded types) *before* expanding them. This
    is relevant to what position information and parameter names are used
    for methods when embedded interfaces have overlapping methods.
    
    This came up in archive/zip, which has:
    
            type fileInfoDirEntry interface {
                    fs.FileInfo
                    fs.DirEntry
            }
    
    and both of these embedded interfaces in turn have an "IsDir() bool"
    method. Traditionally, cmd/compile would keep the method from
    fs.FileInfo.IsDir, but with types2 it will now keep fs.DirEntry.IsDir
    instead. This doesn't affect correctness at all, but it does end up in
    DWARF sometimes.
