    reflect: avoid TypeOf in init
    
    Calling TypeOf to initialize variables forces any import of "reflect"
    to link in the declared types of "reflect" even if they are unused.
    TypeOf operates on Type and which will pull in
    all transitive dependencies of Type, which includes Value as well.
    Avoid this problem by declaring a rtypeOf function that
    directly extracts the *rtype from an interface value
    without going through Type as an intermediate type.
    
    For a program that blank imports "reflect",
    this reduces the binary size by ~34 KiB.
