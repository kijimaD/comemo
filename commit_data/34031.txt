    cmd/dist: only run swig tests when a go directory is present in swiglib
    
    When there is no go directory inside the swiglib directory then swig
    was installed without Go support. Tests in misc/swig will fail when
    swig is installed without Go support.
    
    Add additional checks for the presence of a go directory in the directory
    reported by 'swig -go -swiglib' to determine if misc/swig tests should
    be run.
    
    This avoids all.bash failing when swig but not swig-go is installed
    using macports.
    
    Tested on darwin with swig and with and without swig-go installed
    using macports.
    
    Fixes #23469
