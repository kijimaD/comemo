    net/rpc: fix race condition when request write partially fails
    
    When client fails to write a request is sends caller that error,
    however server might have failed to read that request in the mean
    time and replied with that error. When client then reads the
    response the call would no longer be pending, so call will be nil
    
    Handle this gracefully by discarding such server responses
