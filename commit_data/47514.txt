    cmd/internal/moddeps: fix false positive when $TMPDIR is symlinked
    
    os.Getwd notes that if the current directory can be reached via
    multiple paths (due to symbolic links), Getwd may return any one
    of them. A way to ensure that the desired path is used is to set
    the PWD environment variable pointing to it.
    
    The go generate command has started to update the PWD environment
    variable as of CL 287152, which was the missing link previously
    resulting in mkwinsyscall misunderstanding whether it's inside
    the std lib when symbolic links are involved (issue 44079).
    
    Now all that's left is for us to also set the PWD environment
    variable when invoking the go command in the test, so that it
    too knows the intended working directory path to use.
    
    Fixes #44080.
    Updates #44079.
    Updates #43862.
