    [dev.cc] asm: fix handling of statics (data<>) and symbols
    
    A typo limited the number of center-dot substitutions to one. Fixed.
    
    With these changes, plus a recent fix to 6a, the are no differences,
    down to the bit level, in object code for any assembly files in std
    between asm and 6a. (Runtime has not been checked yet, but I
    expect no errors.)
