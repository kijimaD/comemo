    runtime: remove stale runtime check in tests
    
    The check is not relevant anymore.
    The comment claims that go run does not rebuild packages,
    but this is not true. And we use go build anyway.
    We may have added the check because without caching
    rebuilding everything starting from runtime for each test
    takes a while. But now we have caching.
    So from every side this check just adds code and pain.
