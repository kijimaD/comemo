    os: fix blockUntilWaitable on freebsd/{386,arm}
    
    The previous fix was wrong because it had two misunderstandings on
    freebsd32 calling convention like the following:
    - 32-bit id1 implies that it is the upper half of 64-bit id, indeed it
      depends on machine endianness.
    - 32-bit ARM calling convension doesn't conform to freebsd32_args,
      indeed it does.
    
    This change fixes the bugs and makes blockUntilWaitable work correctly
    on freebsd/{386,arm}.
    
    Fixes #16064.
