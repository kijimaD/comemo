    runtime: fix GC assist retry path
    
    GC assists retry if preempted or if they fail to park. However, on the
    retry path they currently use stale statistics. In particular, the
    retry can use "debtBytes", but debtBytes isn't updated when the debt
    changes (since other than retries it is only used once). Also, though
    less of a problem, the if the assist ratio has changed while the
    assist was blocked, the retry will still use the old assist ratio.
    
    Fix all of this by simply making the retry jump back to where we
    compute these statistics, rather than just after.
