    cmd/internal/obj/arm: fix illegal forms of ARM VFP instruction
    
    "ADDF F0, R1, F2" is silently accepted by the arm assembler and
    assembled to the same binary code of "ADDF F0, F1, F2". So does
    "CMPF F0, R1".
    
    "ABSF F0, F1, F2" is also silently accepted and assembled to a
    different instruction.
    
    This patch reports those illegal forms and adds test cases.
    
    fix #20464
