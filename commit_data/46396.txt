    time: propagate "," separator for fractional seconds into Format
    
    In CL 300996 that fixed issue #6189, we made Parse recognize
    "," as a separator for fractional seconds.
    However, we didn't modify Format to propagate the separator
    verbatim from Parse. Without this change, we break prior
    functionality that relied on a comma being used in Format.
    
    Fixes #48037
