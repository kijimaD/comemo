    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: clean up immediate checking
    
    Change immIFits to return an error in the case that it does not fit.
    This allows for deduplication and consistency of error messages.
    Additionally, since we've already calculated the min and max values,
    we can easily include these in the message. Also provide and use
    immEven, for the same reasons.
