    go/parser: simplify code to read from an io.Reader (cleanup)
    
    ioutil.ReadAll didn't exist when we wrote that parser code
    originally (in 2009). Now it does, so use it. This may also
    make that code path slightly more efficient.
    
    Also, now that we are guaranteed to have a fast path for reading
    from an io.Reader (and thus an io.ReadCloser), simplify setup
    code for parser.ParseFile calls in srcimporter.Importer.ParseFiles.
    
    Remove the associated TODO since we cannot reproduce any significant
    performance differences when running go test -run ImportStdLib for
    the case where we used to read directly from a file (even before the
    change to the parser).
    
    Fixes #19281.
