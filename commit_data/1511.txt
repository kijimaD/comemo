Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    - language for export via capitalized identifiers
    - removed explicit "export" declarations and keyword
    - fixed a few glitches and adjusted examples
    
    (The details of what "export" mean should be clarified
    in the spec, this is just so we have a working doc for
    now.)
