    spec: clarify section on string types
    
    Strings happen to be represented similarly to
    byte slices internally, but they don't quite
    behave like them: While strings can be indexed,
    sliced, and have their len() taken like byte
    slices, string elements are not addressable,
    make() and cap() is not supported, range loops
    operate differently, and they are immutable (and
    thus behave like values rather then references).
    
    Fixes #4018.
