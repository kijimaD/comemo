    Revert "runtime: use QPC for nanotime and time.now on windows/arm"
    
    This reverts change https://golang.org/cl/154758.
    
    Restore the previous implementations of nanotime and time.now, which
    are sufficiently high resolution and more efficient than
    QueryPerformanceCounter. The intent of the change was to improve
    resolution of tracing timestamps, but the change was overly broad
    as it was only necessary to fix cputicks(). cputicks() is fixed in
    a subsequent change.
    
    Updates #26148
