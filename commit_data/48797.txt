    cmd/link: preserve symbol attributes when cloning to external
    
    There are some symbol attributes that are encoded in the object
    file. Currently, they are lost when cloning a symbol to external.
    Copy them over.
    
    Also delete CopyAttributes as it is no longer called anywhere.
