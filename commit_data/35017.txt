    math: add a testcase for Mod and Remainder respectively
    
    One might try to implement the Mod or Remainder function with the expression
    x - TRUNC(x/y + 0.5)*y, but in fact this method is wrong, because the rounding
    of (x/y + 0.5) to initialize the argument of TRUNC may lose too much precision.
    However, the current test cases can not detect this error. This CL adds two
    test cases to prevent people from continuing to do such attempts.
