    runtime: call mmap with MAP_FIXED on BSDs in race mode
    
    This change makes it so that reserving more of the address space for the
    heap calls mmap with MAP_FIXED in race mode. Race mode requires certain
    guarantees on where the heap is located in the address space, and on
    Darwin 10.10 it appears that the kernel may end up ignoring the hint
    quite often (#26475). Using MAP_FIXED is relatively OK in race mode
    because nothing else should be mapped in the memory region provided by
    the initial hints.
    
    Fixes #26475.
