    cmd/link: fix build on plan9/amd64
    
    Support for multiple text sections was added in CL 27790.
    However, this change broke the build on plan9/amd64.
    
    In relocsym, the R_ADDROFF relocation was changed to
    use offsets relative to the start of the first text
    section. However, Segtext.Vaddr is the address of
    the text segment, while we expect to start from
    the first section (text.runtime) of the text segment.
    
    Fixes #17411.
