    cmd/link: shorter type symbol names
    
    Use (part of) a SHA-1 checksum to replace type symbol names.
    
    In typical programs this has no effect because types are not included
    in the symbol table. But when dynamically linking, types are in the
    table to make sure there is only one *rtype per Go type.
    
    Eventually we may be able to get rid of all pointers to rtype values in
    the binary, but probably not by 1.7. And this has a nice effect on
    binary size today:
    
    libstd.so:
            before 27.4MB
            after  26.2MB
    
    For #6853.
