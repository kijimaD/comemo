    go/types, types2: typeparams.IndexExpr must not be an ast.Expr
    
    The typeparams.IndexExpr wrapper type was added as a compatibility layer
    to make the go/types code symmetric with types2. However, this type
    incidentally implemented the ast.Expr interface, leading to the
    accidental misuse that led to golang/go#63933.
    
    Fix this minimally for now, though leave a TODO that this old
    compatibility shim really needs to be eliminated.
    
    Also fix a case in types2 where operand.expr was set to a typed nil.
    
    Fixes golang/go#63933
