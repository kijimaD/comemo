    encoding/base64: slight decoding speed-up
    
    First, use a dummy slice access on decode64 and decode32 to ensure that
    there is a single bounds check for src.
    
    Second, move the PutUint64/PutUint32 calls out of these functions,
    meaning that they are simpler and smaller. This may also open the door
    to inlineability in the future, but for now, they both go past the
    budget.
    
    While at it, get rid of the ilen and olen variables, which have no
    impact whatsoever on performance. At least, not measurable by any of the
    benchmarks.
