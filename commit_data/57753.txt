    runtime: fix bp restoration in panic recovery for arm64
    
    Previously, the frame pointer wouldn't be restored at all, which could
    cause panics during frame pointer unwinding. As of CL 516157, the frame
    pointer is restored, but it's restored incorrectly on arm64: on arm64,
    the frame pointer points one word below SP, but here it's one below
    panic.fp which is the stack pointer of the caller's frame (nothing to do
    with the architectural bp).
    
    For #61766.
