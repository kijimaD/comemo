    runtime: use rwmutex for execLock
    
    Currently the execLock is a mutex, which has the unfortunate
    side-effect of serializing all thread creation. This replaces it with
    an rwmutex so threads can be created in parallel, but exec still
    blocks thread creation.
    
    Fixes #20738.
