    cmd/cover: include a package name in the HTML title
    
    A recent change added a title to the HTML coverage report but
    neglected to include the package name. Add the package name here.
    It's a little trickier than you'd think because there may be multiple
    packages and we don't want to parse the files, so we just extract
    a directory name from the path of the first file.  This will almost
    always be right, and has the advantage that it gives a better result
    for package main. There are rare cases it will get wrong, but that
    will be no hardship.
    
    If this turns out not to be good enough, we can refine it.
    
    Fixes #38609
