    runtime: use indexes for select lock order
    
    Currently the select lock order is a []*hchan. We're going to need to
    refer to things other than the channel itself in lock order shortly,
    so switch this to a []uint16 of indexes into the select cases. This
    parallels the existing representation for the poll order.
