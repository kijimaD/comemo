    net: make concurrent resolver lookups independent
    
    The current resolver uses a global lookupGroup which merges LookupIPAddr
    calls together for lookups for the same hostname if used concurrently.
    As a result only one of the resolvers is actually used to perform the
    DNS lookup but the result is shared by all the resolvers.
    
    This commit limits the scope of the lookupGroup to the resolver itself
    allowing each resolver to make its own requests without sharing the
    result with other resolvers.
    
    Fixes #22908
