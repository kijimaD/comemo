    syscall: if Setctty, require that Ctty be a child descriptor
    
    Ctty was always handled as a child descriptor, but in some cases
    passing a parent descriptor would also work. This depended on
    unpredictable details of the implementation. Reject those cases to
    avoid confusion.
    
    Also reject setting both Setctty and Foreground, as they use Ctty
    in incompatible ways. It's unlikely that any programs set both fields,
    as they don't make sense together.
    
    Fixes #29458
