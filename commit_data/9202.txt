    build: define getcallerpc in u.h (fix for Plan 9 build)
    
    . By defining getcallerpc(x) as __builtin_return_address(0)
      here, it becomes possible to use the Plan 9 compatible form
      when compiling using GCC.  The alternative is to add conditional
      compilation based on the compiler identity in "cmd/8g/gsubr.c"
      to distinguish between the two cases.
