    runtime: don't let readTrace spin on trace.shutdown
    
    Issue #74045 describes a scenario in which gopark is inlined into
    readTrace, such that there are no preemption points. This is only a
    problem because readTrace spins if trace.shutdown is set, through
    traceReaderAvailable. However, trace.shutdown is almost certainly
    overkill for traceReaderAvailable. The first condition, checking whether
    the reader gen and the flushed gen match, should be sufficient to ensure
    the reader wakes up and finishes flushing all buffers. The first
    condition is also safe because it guarantees progress. In the case of
    shutdown, all the trace work that will be flushed has been flushed, and
    so the trace reader will exit into a regular goroutine context when
    it's finished. If not shutting down, then the trace reader will release
    doneSema, increase readerGen, and then the gopark unlockf will let it
    block until new work actually comes in.
    
    Fixes #74045.
