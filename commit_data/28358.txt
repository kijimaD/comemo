    crypto/ecdsa: reject negative inputs.
    
    The fact that crypto/ecdsa.Verify didn't reject negative inputs was a
    mistake on my part: I had unsigned numbers on the brain. However, it
    doesn't generally cause problems. (ModInverse results in zero, which
    results in x being zero, which is rejected.)
    
    The amd64 P-256 code will crash when given a large, negative input.
    
    This fixes both crypto/ecdsa to reject these values and also the P-256
    code to ignore the sign of inputs.
