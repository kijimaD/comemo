    runtime: use private futexes on Linux
    
    By default futexes are permitted in shared memory regions, which
    requires the kernel to translate the memory address. Since our futexes
    are never in shared memory, set FUTEX_PRIVATE_FLAG, which makes futex
    operations slightly more efficient.
