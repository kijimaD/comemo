    cmd/go: use new SWIG -cgo option
    
    This fixes SWIG to work again.  It requires SWIG 3.0.6 or later.
    Earlier versions of SWIG will not work because they generate a .c file
    to be compiled by [568]c, which no longer exist.  As of SWIG 3.0.6
    SWIG supports a -cgo option that tells it to generate files that
    import "C" and can be used with the cgo tool.  With luck this will
    means that future versions of SWIG will not require changes for future
    versions of Go.
