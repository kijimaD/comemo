    runtime: relax SetFinalizer documentation to allow &local
    
    The SetFinalizer documentation states that
    
    "The argument obj must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling
    new or by taking the address of a composite literal."
    
    which precludes pointers to local variables. According to a comment
    on #6591, this case is expected to work. This CL updates the documentation
    for SetFinalizer accordingly.
    
    Fixes #6591
