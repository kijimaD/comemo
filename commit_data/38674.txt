    encoding/json: use SetBytes in UnmarshalReuse benchmark
    
    This was the only benchmark missing the SetBytes call, as spotted
    earlier by Bryan.
    
    It's not required to make the benchmark useful, but it can still be a
    good way to see how its speed is affected by the reduced allocations:
    
    name                  time/op
    CodeUnmarshal-8        12.1ms ± 1%
    CodeUnmarshalReuse-8   11.4ms ± 1%
    
    name                  speed
    CodeUnmarshal-8       161MB/s ± 1%
    CodeUnmarshalReuse-8  171MB/s ± 1%
    
    name                  alloc/op
    CodeUnmarshal-8        3.28MB ± 0%
    CodeUnmarshalReuse-8   1.94MB ± 0%
    
    name                  allocs/op
    CodeUnmarshal-8         92.7k ± 0%
    CodeUnmarshalReuse-8    77.6k ± 0%
    
    While at it, remove some unnecessary empty lines.
