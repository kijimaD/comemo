    cmd/internal/buildid: skip over Mach-O UUID from buildid computation
    
    With the "-B gobuildid" linker option (which will be the default
    on some platforms), the host build ID (GNU build ID, Mach-O UUID)
    depends on the Go buildid. If the host build ID is included in the
    Go buildid computation, it will lead to convergence problem for
    the toolchain binaries. So ignore the host build ID in the buildid
    computation.
    
    This CL only handles Mach-O UUID. ELF GNU build ID will be handled
    later.
    
    For #68678.
    For #63934.
