    net/textproto: properly write terminating sequence if DotWriter is closed with no writes
    
    Fixed textproto.Writer.DotWriter() to properly write \r\n.\r\n to the buffer
    when Close() is called without any bytes written. This properly writes the
    terminating sequence outlined in RFC 5321 section 4.1.1.4 and RFC 3977
    section 3.1.1, even when no other bytes are written.
