    cmd/internal/obj/s390x: use 12 bit load and store instruction when possible on s390x
    
    Originally, we default to use load and store instruction with 20 bit displacement.
    However, that is not necessary. Some instructions have a displacement smaller
    than 12 bit. This CL allows the usage of 12 bit load and store instruction when
    that happens.
    
    This change also reduces the size of .text section in go binary by 19 KB.
    
    Some tests are also added to verify the functionality of the change.
