    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: cleanup ABI utils tests
    
    This CL cleans a few minor nits with the ABI utils tests that are now
    necessary because of cleanups that happened on master:
    
    1. Initialize types.LocalPkg; this needs to be set for selector names
    to be handled correctly.
    
    2. In TestABIUtilsInterfaces, switch to using an exported identifier,
    so it doesn't need to be package qualified.
    
    3. While here, change the method result type from "untyped string" to
    just "string". Constants are the only declared object that can ever
    have an untyped type.
