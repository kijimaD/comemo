    runtime: eliminate write barriers from persistentalloc
    
    We're about to start tracking nowritebarrierrec through systemstack
    calls, which will reveal write barriers in persistentalloc prohibited
    by various callers.
    
    The pointers manipulated by persistentalloc are always to off-heap
    memory, so this removes these write barriers statically by introducing
    a new go:notinheap type to represent generic off-heap memory.
    
    Updates #22384.
    For #22460.
