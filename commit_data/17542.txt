    cmd/go: show FAIL for errors during test setup
    
    For example, if an x_test.go file contains a syntax error,
    b.test fails with an error message. But it wasn't printing
    the same FAIL line that a build failure later would print.
    This makes all the test failures that happen (once we
    decide to start running tests) consistently say FAIL.
    
    Fixes #4701.
