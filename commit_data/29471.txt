    net/http: add ErrAbortHandler, make Server quiet if used as panic value
    
    Add an explicit way for Handlers to abort their response to the client
    and also not spam their error log with stack traces.
    
    panic(nil) also worked in the past (for http1 at least), so continue
    to make that work (and test it). But ErrAbortHandler is more explicit.
    
    Updates #17790 (needs http2 updates also)
