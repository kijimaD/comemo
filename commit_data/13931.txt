    misc/cgo: prepare for 64-bit ints
    
    In a few places, the existing cgo tests assume that a
    Go int is the same as a C int. Making int 64 bits wide
    on 64-bit platforms violates this assumption.
    Change that code to assume that Go int32 and C int
    are the same instead. That's still not great, but it's better,
    and I am unaware of any systems we run on where it is not true.
    
    Update #2188.
