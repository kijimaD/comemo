    runtime: clear isSending bit earlier
    
    I've done some more testing of the new isSending field.
    I'm not able to get more than 2 bits set. That said,
    with this change it's significantly less likely to have even
    2 bits set. The idea here is to clear the bit before possibly
    locking the channel we are sending the value on, thus avoiding
    some delay and some serialization.
    
    For #69312
