    .github: improve formatting of the telemetry proposal template
    
    Tweak the new telemetry proposal template added in CL 583496:
     - Shorten the description, as it is formatted on one conspicuously long
       line in the template picker.
     - Use folded style for label descriptions, as their line breaks cause
       the resulting paragraph to flow awkwardly.

       What change are you proposing to the upload configuration, and why?
       For new upload configuration, which new counters will be collected, what
       do they measure, and why is it important to collect them?
-      All counters must already be instrumented in the target program.
       Note that uploaded data must not carry sensitive user information.
