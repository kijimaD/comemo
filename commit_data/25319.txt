    runtime: add syscalls needed for android/amd64 logging.
    
    access, connect, socket.
    
    In Android-L, logging is done by writing the log messages to the logd
    process through a unix domain socket.
    
    Also, changed the arg types of those syscall stubs to match linux
    programming APIs.
    
    For golang/go#10743
