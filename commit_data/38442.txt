    cmd/go,misc/ios: fix tests on iOS
    
    Now that modules are always on, cmd/go tests require a valid
    GOCACHE. However, on iOS where the go tool is not available, the
    cmd/go test driver ends up setting GOCACHE to the empty string.
    Fix it by falling back to the builtin default cache directory.
    
    The iOS exec wrapper passes the environment variables to the app
    on the device, including $HOME used for the default cache directory.
    Skip $HOME to let the device specific and writable $HOME be used
    instead.
    
    Should fix cmd/go on the iOS builders that broke when GO111MODULE
    defaulted to on.
