    runtime: disallow malloc or panic in scavenge
    
    Mallocs and panics in the scavenge path are particularly nasty because
    they're likely to silently self-deadlock on the mheap.lock. Avoid
    sinking lots of time into debugging these issues in the future by
    turning these into immediate throws.
