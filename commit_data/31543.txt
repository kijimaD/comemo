    strings: fix handling of invalid UTF-8 sequences in Map
    
    The new Map implementation introduced in golang.org/cl/33201
    did not differentiate if an invalid UTF-8 sequence was decoded
    or the RuneError rune. It would therefore always advance by
    3 bytes (which is the length of the RuneError rune) instead
    of 1 for an invalid sequences. This cl adds a check to correctly
    determine the length of bytes needed to advance to the next rune.
    
    Fixes #19330.
