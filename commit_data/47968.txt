    runtime: do not inherit labels on system goroutines
    
    GC background mark worker goroutines are created when the first GC is
    triggered (or next GC after GOMAXPROCS increases). Since the GC can be
    triggered from a user goroutine, those workers will inherit any pprof
    labels from the user goroutine.
    
    That isn't meaningful, so avoid it by excluding system goroutines from
    inheriting labels.
    
    Fixes #50032
