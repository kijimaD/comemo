    runtime: disable scavenger on 64k page size kernels
    
    Update #9993
    
    If the physical page size of the machine is larger than the logical
    heap size, for example 8k logical, 64k physical, then madvise(2) will
    round up the requested amount to a 64k boundary and may discard pages
    close to the page being madvised.
    
    This patch disables the scavenger in these situations, which at the moment
    is only ppc64 and ppc64le systems. NaCl also uses a 64k page size, but
    it's not clear if it is affected by this problem.
