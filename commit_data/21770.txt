    liblink: remove dead computation of p->back in span6/span8
    
    Originally, when this code was part of 6l/8l, every new
    Prog was constructed starting with zprg, which set back=2,
    and then this code walked over the list setting back=1 for
    backward branches, back=0 otherwise. The initial back=2
    setting was used to identify forward branches (the branched-to
    instruction had back == 2 since it hadn't yet been set to 0 or 1).
    
    When the code was extracted into liblink and linked directly
    with 6a/6g/8a/8g, those programs created the Prog struct
    and did not set back=2, breaking this backward branch detection.
    
    No one noticed, because the next loop recomputes the information.
    The only requirement for the next loop is that p->back == 0 or 1 for
    each of the Progs in the list.
    
    The initialization of the zprg with back=2 would cause problems
    in this second loop, for the few liblink-internally-generated instructions
    that are created by copying zprg, except that the first loop was
    making sure that back == 0 or 1.
    
    The first loop's manipulation of p->back can thus be deleted,
    provided we also delete the zprg.back = 2 initializations.
    
    This is awful and my fault. I apologize.
    
    While we're here, remove the .scale = 1 from the zprg init too.
    Anything that sets up a scaled index should set the scale itself.
    (And mostly those come from outside liblink anyway.)
    
    Tested by checking that all generated code is bit-for-bit
    identical to before this CL.
