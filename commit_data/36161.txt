    doc: add a note about loading profile files
    
    If one is somewhat new to the command line or shell, it might be
    surprising that changes applied to a file like $HOME/.profile will
    seemingly not take effect, even if new shells are started.
    
    Add a note about how shells usually only load these when the user logs
    into a machine, to minimize the amount of people stuck and confused by
    this.
    
    Fixes #24756.
