    reflect: Add tests for Call with functions taking and returning structs.
    
    gccgo has problems using reflect.Call with functions that take and
    return structs with no members.  Prior to fixing that problem there, I
    thought it sensible to add some tests of this situation.
    
    Update #6761
    
    First contribution to Go, apologies in advance if I'm doing it wrong.
