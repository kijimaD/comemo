    runtime: remove arbitrary GOARCH constraints in finalizer tests
    
    These tests were only run on GOARCH=amd64, but the rationale given in
    CL 11858043 was GC precision on 32-bit platforms. Today, we have far
    more 64-bit platforms than just amd64, and I believe that GC precision
    on 32-bit platforms has been substantially improved as well.
    The GOARCH restriction seems unnecessary.
    
    Updates #57166.
    Updates #5368.
