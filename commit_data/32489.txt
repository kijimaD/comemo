    image/jpeg: fix extended sequential Huffman table selector (Th).
    
    Previously, the package did not distinguish between baseline and
    extended sequential images. Both are non-progressive images, but the Th
    range differs between the two, as per Annex B of
    https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf
    
    Extended sequential images are often emitted by the Guetzli encoder.
    
    Fixes #19913
