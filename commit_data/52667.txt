    cmd/compile: better code generation for constant-fold switch
    
    CL 399694 added constant-fold switch early in compilation. So function:
    
    func f() string {
        switch intSize {
        case 32:
            return "32"
        case 64:
            return "64"
        default:
            panic("unreachable")
        }
    }
    
    will be constant-fold to:
    
    func f() string {
        switch intSize {
        case 64:
            return "64"
        }
    }
    
    When this function get inlined, there is a check whether we can delay
    declaring the result parameter until the "return" statement. For the
    original function, we can't delay the result, because there's more than
    one return statement. However, the constant-fold one can, because
    there's on one return statement in the body now. The result parameter
    ~R0 ends up declaring inside the switch statement scope.
    
    Now, when walking the switch statement, it's re-written into if-else
    statement. Without typecheck.EvalConst, the if condition "if 64 == 64"
    is passed as-is to the ssa generation pass. Because "64 == 64" is not a
    constant, the ssagen creates normal blocks for branching the results.
    This confuses the liveness analysis, because ~R0 is only live inside the
    if block. With typecheck.EvalConst, "64 == 64" is evaluated to "true",
    so ssagen can branch the result without emitting conditional blocks.
    
    Instead, the constant-fold can be re-written as:
    
    switch {
    case true:
        // Body
    }
    
    So it does not depend on the delay results check during inlining. Adding
    a test, which will fail when typecheck.EvalConst is removed, so we can
    do the cleanup without breaking things.
