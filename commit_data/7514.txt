    build: reduce the use of subshells in recursive make
    
    Using make -C $* rather than (cd $* ; make) results in a small,
    but measurable improvement in build times where compilation is
    not the major component. eg.
    
    before - ~/go/src/pkg$ time make
            real    0m1.176s
            user    0m0.639s
            sys     0m0.399s
    after - ~/go/src/pkg$ time make
            real    0m0.916s
            user    0m0.571s
            sys     0m0.243s
    
    There are other places in the distribution src/make.common for example
    that could also benefit from this change.
