    cmd/compiler/internal/gc: remove flag argument from fconv (cleanup)
    
    The fconv flag arguments were 0, FmtSharp, and FmtSharp|FmtSign.
    The 0 value was used for binary representation only, which was
    readily available via Mpflt.String. Otherwise, FmtSharp was always
    passed. FmtSign was used to print the '+' sign in case of a positive
    number and only needed for complex number formatting. Instead
    implemented cconv and handled it there.
