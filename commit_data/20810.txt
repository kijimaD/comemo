    os: fix write on Plan 9
    
    In CL 160670043 the write function was changed
    so a zero-length write is now allowed. This leads
    the ExampleWriter_Init test to fail.
    
    The reason is that Plan 9 preserves message
    boundaries, while the os library expects systems
    that don't preserve them. We have to ignore
    zero-length writes so they will never turn into EOF.
    
    This issue was previously discussed in CL 7406046.
