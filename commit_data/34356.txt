    cmd/go: delete ETXTBSY hack that is no longer needed
    
    This hack existed because cmd/go used to install (write) and then run
    cmd/cgo in the same invocation, and writing and then running a program
    is a no-no in modern multithreaded Unix programs (see #22315).
    
    As of CL 68338, cmd/go no longer installs any programs that it then
    tries to use. It never did this for any program other than cgo, and
    CL 68338 removed that special case for cgo.
    
    Now this special case, added for #3001 long ago, can be removed too.
