    implement new semicolon rules:
    
     *  1. all statements and declarations are terminated by semicolons
     *  2. semicolons can be omitted at top level.
     *  3. semicolons can be omitted before and after the closing ) or }
     *      on a list of statements or declarations.
    
    now that semicolons are in, uncomment forward declaration
            of interfaces
