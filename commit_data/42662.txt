    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: don't remove NOP in assembler
    
    Previously, the assembler removed NOPs from the Prog list in
    obj9.go. NOPs shouldn't be removed if they were added as
    an inline mark, as described in the issue below.
    
    Fixes #40689
    
    Once the NOPs were left in the Prog list, some instructions
    were flagged as invalid because they had an operand which was
    not represented in optab. In order to preserve the previous
    assembler behavior, entries were added to optab for those
    operand cases. They were not flagged as errors before because
    the NOP instructions were removed before the code to check the
    valid opcode/operand combinations.
