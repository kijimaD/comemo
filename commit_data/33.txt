commit d2490e7419269e34c1ae10a086e8c6b90b2e6140
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 19 15:45:07 2008 -0700

    - Implemented simple rule for optional semicolons:
      Semicolons are terminators for statements as in C,
      but if followed by a "}" they are not required.
      This is easy to understand and produces the desired
      result for statements.
    - Updated todo.txt.
