    runtime: clarify address space limit constants and comments
    
    Now that we support the full non-contiguous virtual address space of
    amd64 hardware, some of the comments and constants related to this are
    out of date.
    
    This renames memLimitBits to heapAddrBits because 1<<memLimitBits is
    no longer the limit of the address space and rewrites the comment to
    focus first on hardware limits (which span OSes) and then discuss
    kernel limits.
    
    Second, this eliminates the memLimit constant because there's no
    longer a meaningful "highest possible heap pointer value" on amd64.
    
    Updates #23862.
