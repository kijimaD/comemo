    runtime/pprof: compare all samples vs rusage in TestCPUProfileMultithreadMagnitude
    
    TestCPUProfileMultithreadMagnitude compares pprof results vs OS rusage
    to verify that pprof is capturing all CPU usage. Presently it compares
    the sum of cpuHog1 samples vs rusage. However, background usage from the
    scheduler, GC, etc can cause additional CPU usage causing test failures
    if rusage is too far off from the cpuHog1 samples.
    
    That said, this test doesn't actually need to care about cpuHog1
    samples. It simply cares that pprof samples match rusage, not what the
    breakdown of usage was. As a result, we can compare the sum of _all_
    pprof samples vs rusage, which should implicitly include any background
    CPU usage.
    
    Fixes #50097.
