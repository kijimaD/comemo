    encoding/xml: add Marshal doc about name conflicts
    
    The docs for xml.Marshal state that the XML elements name is derived
    from one of five locations in a specific order of precedence, but does
    not mention that if the field is a struct type and has its name defined
    in a tag and in the types XMLName field that an error will occur. This
    is documented in the structFieldInfo function but not in the function
    documentation, and the existing docs in Marshal are misleading without
    this behavior being discussed.
    
    Fixes #18564
