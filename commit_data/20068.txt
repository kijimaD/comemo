    time: removed from tests now obsolete assumption about Australian tz abbreviations
    
    Australian timezones abbreviation for standard and daylight saving time were recently
    changed from EST for both to AEST and AEDT in the icann tz database (see changelog
    on www.iana.org/time-zones).
    
    A test in the time package was written to check that the ParseInLocation function
    understand that Feb EST and Aug EST are different time zones, even though they are
    both called EST. This is no longer the case, and the Date function now returns
    AEST or AEDT for australian tz on every Linux system with an up to date tz database
    (and this makes the test fail).
    
    Since I wasn't able to find another country that 1) uses daylight saving and 2) has
    the same abbreviation for both on tzdata, I changed the test to make sure that
    ParseInLocation does not get confused when it parses, in different locations, two
    dates with the same abbreviation (this was suggested in the mailing list).
    
    Fixes #8547.
