    runtime: handle and test large map values
    
    This is from CL 5451105 but was dropped from that CL.
    See also CL 6137051.
    
    The only change compared to 5451105 is to check for
    h != nil in reflectÂ·mapiterinit; allowing use of nil maps
    must have happened after that original CL.
    
    Fixes #3573.
