    cmd/api: set architecture sizes when type checking
    
    Otherwise the type checker defaults to amd64, which can break
    type-checking for definitions using unsafe.Sizeof.
    
    This has the side effect of changing the API output: constants with
    different values across architectures (e.g., MaxInt) are now
    individually listed per-arch. This actually makes the API file more
    accurate, but does introduce a one-time discontinuity. These changes
    have been integrated into the API files where the constants were added.
