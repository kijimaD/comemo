    cmd/dist: fix build failure of misc/cgo/test on arm64
    
    misc/cgo/test fails in 'dist test' on arm64 if the C compiler is of GCC-9.4 or
    above and its 'outline atomics' feature is enabled, since the internal linking
    hasn't yet supported "__attribute__((constructor))" and also mis-handles hidden
    visibility.
    
    This change addresses the problem by skipping the internal linking cases of
    misc/cgo/test on linux/arm64. It fixes 'dist test' failure only, user is expected to
    pass a GCC option '-mno-outline-atomics' via CGO_CFLAGS if running into the same
    problem when building cgo programs using internal linking.
    
    Updates #39466
