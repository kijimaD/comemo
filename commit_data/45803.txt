    cmd/go: fix failing gccgo cases in TestScript/build_overlay
    
    The 'go install' command does not support the -gccgo flag.
    (I'm not sure why, but it doesn't.)
    
    gccgo also uses system-native assembly syntax instead of cmd/compile's
    Plan 9 derivative. I've added an assembly file that seems to work on
    Linux, but I haven't tested it on other platforms; if it fails on
    other platforms, we can refine the test as needed.
    
    Fixes #42688
