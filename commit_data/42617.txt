    doc/go1.14: note that module support is ready for production use
    
    The public proxy and checksum database launched with Go 1.13 have been
    running smoothly, pkg.go.dev is serving module-aware documentation,
    and in 1.14 we have improved the vendoring workflow and finished
    Subversion support to reach parity with GOPATH mode for users of those
    features, updated documentation (including the “How to Write Go Code”
    intro document) and published blog posts describing common modes of
    usage, and improved the migration path for existing v2+ modules by
    making version resolution less aggressive about "+incompatible" major
    versions.
    
    We (always) have more fit-and-finish work to do, but at this point we
    believe that module mode will provide a better user experience than
    GOPATH mode for most users, including in production use.

+Module support in the <code>go</code> command is now ready for production use,
