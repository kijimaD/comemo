    reflect: test GC bits for slices
    
    Currently we test bitmap repetitions constructed by the compiler (for
    small arrays) and repetitions performed by GC programs (large arrays
    and reflect-constructed arrays), but we don't test dynamic repetitions
    performed by the runtime for slice backing stores. Add tests that
    parallel the array tests using slices.
