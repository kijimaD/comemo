    runtime: add direct benchmark of mutex contention
    
    Measure throughput of a single mutex with all threads contending. Do not
    attempt to measure fairness/starvation.
    
    The ChanContended benchmark works somewhat well for this (interacting
    with the mutex is a large contributor to its results), but it's better
    to be clear about what we're attempting to measure.
    
    For #68578
