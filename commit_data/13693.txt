    runtime: use netbsd signal ABI v2
    
    Use version 2 of the NetBSD signal ABI - both version 2 and version 3
    are supported by the kernel, with near identical behaviour. However,
    the netbsd32 compat code does not allow version 3 to be used, which
    prevents Go netbsd/386 binaries from running in compat mode on a
    NetBSD amd64 kernel. Switch to version 2 of the ABI, which is the
    same version currently used by NetBSD's libc.
