    ld: mark PE executables as terminal services aware
    
    This has been the default in MSVC for a very long time, and it's hard to
    imagine modern programs actually wanting the old legacy behavior. For
    example, no modern programs try to install their junk into C:\windows
    and therefore need to have an emulated writable windows directory.
    That's not really even allowed by ACLs on modern systems.
