    runtime: trivial clean ups to greyobject
    
    Previously, the typeDead check in greyobject was under a separate
    !useCheckmark conditional.  Put it with the rest of the !useCheckmark
    code.  Also move a comment about atomic update of the marked bit to
    where we actually do that update now.
