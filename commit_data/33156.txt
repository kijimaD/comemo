    runtime: align stack in 386 lib startup before calling C function
    
    Fixes Darwin 386 build. It turns out that the Darwin pthread_create
    function saves the SSE registers, and therefore requires an aligned stack.
    This worked before https://golang.org/cl/70530 because the stack sizes
    were chosen to leave the stack aligned.
