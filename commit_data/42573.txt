    net: handle more interface types without a hardware address on Plan 9
    
    We were handling loopback devices when attempting to read hardware
    address, but packet interfaces were not being handled. As a general fix,
    don't attempt to read hardware address of any device that's not inside
    /net.
    
    Fixes #39908
