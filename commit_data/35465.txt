    cmd/compile: ignore g register in liveness analysis
    
    In rare circumstances that we don't yet fully understand, the g
    register can be spilled to the stack and then reloaded. If this
    happens, liveness analysis sees a pointer load into a
    non-general-purpose register and panics.
    
    We should fix the root cause of this, but fix the build for now by
    ignoring pointer loads into the g register.
    
    For #25504.
