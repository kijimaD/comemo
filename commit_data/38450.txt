    runtime: remove npreleased in favor of boolean
    
    This change removes npreleased from mspan since spans may now either be
    scavenged or not scavenged; how many of its pages were actually scavenged
    doesn't matter. It saves some space in mpsan overhead too, as the boolean
    fits into what would otherwise be struct padding.
    
    For #14045.
