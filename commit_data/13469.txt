commit 882b6ef4542e7055c7dcd262b22c434b957195df
Author: Marcel van Lohuizen <mpvl@golang.org>

    exp/locale/collate: This CL includes the following changes:
    - Changed the representation of colElem to support a few cases
      for some languages not supported by the current format.
    - Changed offsets for implicit primary values. This makes the
      values both easier to read and debug (last 4 nibbles are identical to
      implicit primary value) and also results in better packing.
    - Fixed bug in weight conversion code that did not pop up yet by
      sheer luck.
    Note that tables.go also includes changes to the contraction trie
    from CL 6346092.
