    misc/cgo/test: set the traceback level instead of failing the test
    
    Previously, test7978 failed if the user did not invoke it with
    GOTRACEBACK=2 already set in their environment. Environment-sensitive
    test are awkward, and in this case there is a very simple workaround:
    set the traceback level to the necessary value explicitly.
