    go/types: add test case for incorrect map index expression
    
    The existing code for map index expressions checked the
    wrong variable (x rather than key) to see if the index
    assignment was correct. Since x.mode was always valid in
    that case, type-checking didn't follow the error exit in
    case of an incorrect map index expression.
    
    However, since we know the correct map element type
    irrespective of the validity of the map key, the existing
    code path is preferrable over exiting early via an error
    because the map index expression returns a valid type which
    then can be used for further type-checking.
    
    Removed the unneeded 'if' statement and added a test case
    producing the expected two errors (rather than only one if
    we would "correct" the 'if' statement instead).
    
    In summary, this commit adds a test but doesn't change the
    behavior of type-checking of map index expressions.
