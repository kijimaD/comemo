    internal/pkgbits: explain the rationale for reference tables
    
    The primary benefit of reference tables is to the linker, though they
    are also reasonably compact as compared to absolute element indices. It
    is worth also checking if reference table structure is similarly
    exploited past the IR linking stage.
    
    Ideally, the reference table definition would live in / near the linker.
    As it stands, it's a bit hard to infer the purpose of the reference
    tables when looking at pkgbits in isolation.
