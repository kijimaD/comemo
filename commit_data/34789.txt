    archive/zip: fix handling of replacement rune in UTF8 check
    
    The replacement rune is a valid rune and can appear as itself in valid UTF8
    (it encodes as three bytes). To check for invalid UTF8 it is necessary to
    look for utf8.DecodeRune returning the replacement rune and size==1.
