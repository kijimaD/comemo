    cmd/distpack: rename go.mod to _go.mod in toolchain modules
    
    Modules cannot contain go.mod files except at the root
    (and we don't keep one at the root). Rename the other go.mod
    files to _go.mod.
    
    dl2mod, which we used to convert all the old releases,
    did this renaming, but it was missed when porting that
    code to distpack.
    
    For #57001.
    Fixes #60847.
