    sort: fixed bug in (Float64Slice) Less; NaN less than anything else
    
    Previously comparisons with NaN led to contradictory results if it was
    compared to anything not NaN, since Less always returned false, thus
    breaking monotonicity of ordering.
    This fix makes NaN less than anything else and adds NaN and (+-)Inf to
    testcases.
    
    Fixes #2092.
