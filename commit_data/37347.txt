    preserving the additions needed for assignments in templates to work.

-    <p>
-      This required backwards-incompatible changes to the <code>text/template/parse</code>
-      package, but was deemed acceptable since the package's documentation clearly states
-      that it isn't intended for general use.

     <p><!-- CL 95215 -->
       In previous versions untyped <code>nil</code> values passed to
       template functions were ignored. They are now passed as normal
