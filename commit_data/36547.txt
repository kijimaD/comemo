    crypto/x509: clarify docs for SystemCertPool
    
    The sentence in the docs for SystemCertPool that states that mutations
    to a returned pool do not affect any other pool is ambiguous as to who
    the any other pools are, because pools can be created in multiple ways
    that have nothing to do with the system certificate pool. Also the use
    of the word 'the' instead of 'a' early in the sentence implies there is
    only one shared pool ever returned.
    
    Fixes #27385
