    cmd/go/internal/clean: add logging to help debug openbsd flakes
    
    This change adds extra logging in the case where there's an error
    removing all the files in the gomodcache using modfetch.RemoveAll.
    It logs the names of the files found in GOMODCACHE as well as their
    modes. The modes are included because they should all be writable by the
    time we call robustio.RemoveAll.
    
    For #68087
