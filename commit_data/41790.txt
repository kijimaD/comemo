    [dev.link] cmd/link: rework relocation handling in new deadcode
    
    Do a better job of reading relocations in the new deadcode pass.
    Specifically, during method type processing, read relocations for the
    symbol we're working on into a slice, and then pass the slice to
    helper functions, as opposed to rereading relocs at each stage.
