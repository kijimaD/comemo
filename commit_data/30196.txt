    database/sql: ensure driverConns are closed if not returned to pool
    
    Previously if a connection was requested but timed out during the
    request and when acquiring the db.Lock the connection request
    is fulfilled and the request is unable to be returned to the
    connection pool, then then driver connection would not be closed.
    
    No tests were added or modified because I was unable to determine
    how to trigger this situation without something invasive.
