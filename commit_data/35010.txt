    net: return io.ErrClosedPipe when possible from net.Pipe
    
    The previous implementation of net.Pipe was just a thin wrapper around
    io.Pipe and did not wrap any of the io.Pipe errors as net.Errors.
    As a result of Hyrum's law, users have come to depend on the fact that
    net.Pipe returns io.ErrClosedPipe when the pipe is closed.
    Thus, we preserve this behavior to avoid regressing such use cases.
