    cmd/compile: move a lot of declarations outside of go.go
    
    go.go is currently a grab bag of various unrelated type and variable
    declarations. Move a bunch of them into other more relevant source
    files.
    
    There are still more that can be moved, but these were the low hanging
    fruit with obvious homes.
    
    No code/comment changes. Just shuffling stuff around.
