    runtime: remove unused gcstats
    
    The gcstats structure is no longer consumed by anything and no longer
    tracks statistics that are particularly relevant to the concurrent
    garbage collector. Remove it. (Having statistics is probably a good
    idea, but these aren't the stats we need these days and we don't have
    a way to get them out of the runtime.)
    
    In preparation for #13613.
