    spec: introduce alias declarations and type definitions
    
    To avoid confusion caused by the term "named type" (which now just
    means a type with a name, but formerly meant a type declared with
    a non-alias type declaration), a type declaration now comes in two
    forms: alias declarations and type definitions. Both declare a type
    name, but type definitions also define new types.
    
    Replace the use of "named type" with "defined type" elsewhere in
    the spec.
    
    For #18130.
