    cmd/compile: skip ssa/debug_test.go when gdb missing etc.
    
    CL50610 broke the build for noopt (different inlining
    behavior) and clang (no gdb) so it needs to catch those
    cases and skip.
    
    The run/no-run logic was slightly cleaned up,
    the name of gdb on OSX was made more robust (tries gdb
    first, then ggdb), and the file names were canonicalized
    before loggging instead of in comparison to reduce
    gratuitous noise in diffs when things aren't otherwise
    equal.
    
    This probably doesn't fix problems on Alpine, but it should
    provide a cleaner and less confusing failure.
