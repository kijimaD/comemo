    cmd/compile: fix typechecking of untyped boolean expressions
    
    Previously, if we typechecked a statement like
    
        var x bool = p1.f == p2.f && p1.g == p2.g
    
    we would correctly update the '&&' node's type from 'untyped bool' to
    'bool', but the '==' nodes would stay 'untyped bool'. This is
    inconsistent, and caused consistency checks during walk to fail.
    
    This CL doesn't pass toolstash because it seems to slightly affect the
    register allocator's heuristics. (Presumably 'untyped bool's were
    previously making it all the way through SSA?)
    
    Fixes #23414.
