    cmd/go: import runtime/cgo when externally linking
    
    Restore CL 477195, which was reverted in CL 477795.
    This version includes CL 477397, which fixes the test problems
    with CL 477195. CL 477397 was not submitted because it had an
    unrelated failure on darwin-amd64. That failure is fixed by CL 477736.
    
    Fixes #31544
