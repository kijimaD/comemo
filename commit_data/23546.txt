    fmt: restore padding for %x on byte slices and strings
    
    Also improve the documentation. A prior fix in this release
    changed the properties for empty strings and slices, incorrectly.
    Previous behavior is now restored and better documented.
    
    Add lots of tests.
    
    The behavior is that when using a string-like format (%s %q %x %X)
    a byte slice is equivalent to a string, and printed as a unit. The padding
    applies to the entire object. (The space and sharp flags apply
    elementwise.)
    
    Fixes #11422.
    Fixes #10430.
