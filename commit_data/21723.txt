    runtime: simplify NetBSD semaphores
    
    NetBSD's semaphore implementation is derived from OpenBSD's, but has
    subsequently diverged due to cleanups that were only applied to the
    latter (https://golang.org/cl/137960043, https://golang.org/cl/5563).
    This CL applies analogous cleanups for NetBSD.
    
    Notably, we can also remove the scary NetBSD deadlock warning.
    NetBSD's manual pages document that lwp_unpark on a not-yet-parked LWP
    will cause that LWP's next lwp_park system call to return immediately,
    so there's no race hazard.
