    os: add ModeIrregular flag
    
    There is currently no way for os.FileMode.IsRegular to report false
    without being one of the following types:
            ModeDir | ModeSymlink | ModeNamedPipe | ModeSocket | ModeDevice
    
    This makes it difficult for custom implementations of os.FileInfo to return
    a Mode that is explicitly not regular without resorting to setting one
    of the types listed above. However, every one of the aforementioned types
    are ill-suited as a general-purpose "not regular" file type.
    
    Thus, add a ModeIrregular to serve exactly for that purpose.
    The ModeIrregular type carries no information other than the fact that the
    file is not regular.
