    os, syscall: don't consider stderr output as part of hostname
    
    A successful invocation of the hostname command prints the hostname
    to stdout and exits with code 0. No part of the hostname is printed
    to stderr, so don't consider it.
    
    This avoids false positive failures in environments where hostname
    prints some extraneous information (such as performance warnings)
    to stderr, and makes the test a bit more robust.
    
    Fixes #52781.
