    crypto/x509: write exact BitLength in ASN.1 encoding for certificate KeyUsage
    
    The encoded value of the certificate KeyUsage did contain additonal padding
    that was not present with other certificate generators. According to ITU-T
    X.690 the BitLength value should have no padding in a DER encoding.
