    net/rpc: don't exit if Accept gets an error
    
    The default implementation of Accept, which spins up a new server
    for every new connection, calls log.Fatal if the listener is closed,
    stopping any outstanding work. Change that to a non-fatal log
    call so work can continue.
    
    There is no programmatic signaling of the problem, just the log,
    but that should be enough.
    
    Fixes #11221.
