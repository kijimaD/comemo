    cmd/go: add move test for goroot
    
    This  an end-to-end test that sets GOROOT to a symlink
    to the distribution, approximating copying it to a new
    location, and checks that packages in the standard library
    are not stale, as they would be if paths were embedded
    in artifacts.
    
    For #47257
