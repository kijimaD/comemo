    cmd/cgo: add -trimpath flag allowing paths to be rewritten in outputs
    
    cmd/cgo now has a -trimpath flag that behaves the same as the
    -trimpath flag to cmd/compile. This will be used to correct paths
    to cgo files that are overlaid.
    
    The code that processes trimpath in internal/objapi has been slightly
    refactored because it's currently only accessible via AbsFile, which
    does some additional processing to the path names. Now an
    ApplyRewrites function is exported that just applies the trimpath
    rewrites.
    
    Also remove unused srcfile argument to cmd/cgo.(*Package).godefs.
    
    For #39958
