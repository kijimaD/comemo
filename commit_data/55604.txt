    cmd/compile/internal/pgo: fix RedirectEdges
    
    'RedirectEdges' may range over an out-edge slice under modification, leading to out-of-index
    panic, and reuse an IREdge object by mistake if there are multiple inlining call-sites.
    
    Fix by rewriting part of the redirecting operation.
    
    Remove 'redirectEdges' as it's not used now and not working as expected in case of multiple
    inlining call-sites.
    
    Fixes #58437.
