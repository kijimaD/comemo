    net/http: enable WASM fetch where supported
    
    The existing check was introduced to allow tests to pass
    on WASM without an environment where the fetch RoundTripper
    could run. However, the check now prohibits the use of the
    Fetch RoundTripper in all WASM tests, even where the
    RoundTripper could run. The new change should only disable
    the RoundTripper when used in an environment without fetch.
    
    Fixes #32289
