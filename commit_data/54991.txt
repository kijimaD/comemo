    cmd/compile: replace magic numbers "2" and "1" with named constant
    
    This was originally done for a #next-encoding-based check for
    misbehaving loops, but it's a good idea anyhow because it makes
    the code slightly easier to follow or change (we may decide to
    check for errors the "other way" anyhow, later).
