    cmd/doc: show documentation for interface methods when requested explicitly
    
    For historical reasons, the go/doc package does not include
    the methods within an interface as part of the documented
    methods for that type. Thus,
    
            go doc ast.Node.Pos
    
    gives an incorrect and confusing error message:
    
            doc: no method Node.Pos in package go/ast
    
    This CL does some dirty work to dig down to the methods
    so interface methods now present their documentation:
    
    % go doc ast.node.pos
    func Pos() token.Pos  // position of first character belonging to the node
    %
    
    It must largely sidestep the doc package to do this, which
    is a shame. Perhaps things will improve there one day.
    
    The change does not handle embeddings, and in principle the
    same approach could be done for struct fields, but that is also
    not here yet. But this CL fixes the thing that was bugging me.
