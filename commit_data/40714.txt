    os/signal: use a larger channel buffer for all signals in TestSignal
    
    Now that the runtime can send preemption signals, it is possible that
    a channel that asks for all signals can see both SIGURG and SIGHUP
    before reading either, in which case one of the signals will be dropped.
    We have to use a larger buffer so that the test see the signal it expects.
    
    Fixes #35466
