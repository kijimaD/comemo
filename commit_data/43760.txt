    cmd/compile: move fixVariadicCall from walk to order
    
    This CL moves fixVariadicCall from mid-Walk of function calls to
    early-Order, in preparation for moving it even earlier in the future.
    
    Notably, rewriting variadic calls this early introduces two
    compilation output changes:
    
    1. Previously, Order visited the ODDDARG before the rest of the
    arguments list, whereas the natural time to visit it is at the end of
    the list (as we visit arguments left-to-right, and the ... argument is
    the rightmost one). Changing this ordering permutes the autotmp
    allocation order, which in turn permutes autotmp naming and stack
    offsets.
    
    2. Previously, Walk separately walked all of the variadic arguments
    before walking the entire slice literal, whereas the more natural
    thing to do is just walk the entire slice literal. This triggers
    slightly different code paths for composite literal construction in
    some cases.
    
    Neither of these have semantic impact. They simply mean we're now
    compiling f(a,b,c) the same way as we were already compiling
    f([]T{a,b,c}...).
