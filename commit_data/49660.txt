    A+C: delete AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS
    
    In 2009, Google's open-source lawyers asked us to create the AUTHORS
    file to define "The Go Authors", and the CONTRIBUTORS file was in
    keeping with open source best practices of the time.
    
    Re-reviewing our repos now in 2022, the open-source lawyers are
    comfortable with source control history taking the place of the
    AUTHORS file, and most open source projects no longer maintain
    CONTRIBUTORS files.
    
    To ease maintenance, remove AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS from all repos.
    
    For #53961.
