    cmd/compile: in compiler errors, print more digits for floats close to an int
    
    Error messages currently print floats with %.6g, which means that if
    you tried to convert something close to, but not quite, an integer, to
    an integer, the error you get looks like "cannot convert 1 to type
    int", when really you want "cannot convert 0.9999999 to type int".
    
    Add more digits to floats when printing them, to make it clear that they
    aren't quite integers. This helps for errors which are the result of not
    being an integer. For other errors, it won't hurt much.
    
    Fixes #56220
