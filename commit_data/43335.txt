    cmd/dist: skip API check on plan9 builders
    
    The plan9-arm builder has a very slow filesystem and frequently times
    out on this test. The api check verifies the API for all supported
    GOOS/GOARCH/CGO_ENABLED combination anyway, so if we skip it on one
    builder (or even most builders) there should be no loss of coverage.
    
    Updates #37951
