    cmd/compile: enable more inlining for unified IR
    
    The non-unified frontend had repeated issues with inlining and
    generics (#49309, #51909, #52907), which led us to substantially
    restrict inlining when shape types were present.
    
    However, these issues are evidently not present in unified IR's
    inliner, and the safety restrictions added for the non-unified
    frontend can simply be disabled in unified mode.
    
    Fixes #54497.
