    runtime/pprof: fix TestCPUProfileWithFork for GOOS=android.
    
    1) Large allocation in this test caused crash. This was not
    detected by builder because builder runs tests with -test.short.
    
    2) The command "go" for forking doesn't exist in some platforms
    including android. This change uses the test binary itself which
    is guaranteed to exist.
    
    This change also adds logging of the total samples collected in
    TestCPUProfileMultithreaded test that is flaky in android-arm
    builder.
