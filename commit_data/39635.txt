    ld: fix up header copy and paste error
    
    Some constants were added above the initial copyright blurb, and then
    later a new copyright blurb was added on top of that. So we wound up
    with two header sections, one of which contained a useful comment that
    became obscured. This commit fixes up that mistake.
