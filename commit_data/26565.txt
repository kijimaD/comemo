    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: fix for bug in cse speed improvements
    
    Problem was caused by use of Args[].Aux differences
    in early partitioning.  This artificially separated
    two equivalent expressions because sort ignores the
    Aux field, hence things can end with equal things
    separated by unequal things and thus the equal things
    are split into more than one partition.  For example:
    SliceLen(a), SliceLen(b), SliceLen(a).
    
    Fix: don't use Args[].Aux in initial partitioning.
    
    Left in a debugging flag and some debugging Fprintf's;
    not sure if that is house style or not.  We'll probably
    want to be more systematic in our naming conventions,
    e.g. ssa.cse, ssa.scc, etc.
