    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: reorder the assembler's optab entries
    
    Current optab entries are unordered, because the new instructions
    are added at the end of the optab. The patch reorders them by comments
    in optab, such as arithmetic operations, logical operations and a
    series of load/store etc.
    
    The patch removes the VMOVS opcode because FMOVS already has the same
    operation.
