    cmd/vet: add missing %v to the verb regex
    
    In golang.org/cl/74352, the print rules were overhauled to give better
    error messages. This also meant adding a regex to find and extract the
    used formatting verbs.
    
    However, %v was missed. Add it to the expression, and add a test too.
    
    Fixes #22847.
