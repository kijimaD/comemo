    syscall: add a Go directive "go:nocheckptr" to forkAndExecInChild1
    
    forkAndExecInChild1 func must not acquire any locks in child, because
    they might have been locked at the time of the fork. This implies to
    no rescheduling, no malloc calls, and no new stack segments.
    
    So, doing a "checkptrAlignment" is bad here, because checkptr
    functions added by the instrumentation could grow the stack, which
    should not be done between fork and exec calls.
    
    Hence using a Go directive "go:nocheckptr" to forkAndExecInChild1
    func,so that the compiler should not do "checkptrAlignment" when
    functions marked with "go:norace".
    
    This race detection bug was caught in go 1.21 on s390x.
    Running a "./race.bash" script from "go/src" directory failed and the
    bug details are provided in issue link mentioned below.
    
    Fixes #58785
