    cmd/compile: permit Unicode spaces in (expanded) package paths
    
    This doesn't change the existing restriction with disallows
    spaces in import paths (as found in an import declaration).
    It simply permits packages to be under a directory name that
    may contain spaces.
    
    Verified manually that it works. This could use a test, but the
    change is trivial. We also can't use the existing test framework
    (under test/) because the way those tests are run with test/run.go,
    the mechanims for compiling a directory, even if it contains blanks
    it its name, does't produce compiler paths with blanks
    (the compilation is local).
    
    Fixes #20306.
