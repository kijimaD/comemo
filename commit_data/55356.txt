    cmd/dist: set GOFLAGS=-trimpath when building cmd for releases
    
    Also set it on the Go builders, so that the builders more closely
    match releases.
    
    It looks like this change was intended to be included in CL 454836,
    but was commented out at some point — perhaps during debugging? —
    before that change was merged.
    
    For #24904.
