    runtime: do not call wakep from enlistWorker, to avoid possible deadlock
    
    We have seen one instance of a production job suddenly spinning to
    100% CPU and becoming unresponsive. In that one instance, a SIGQUIT
    was sent after 328 minutes of spinning, and the stacks showed a single
    goroutine in "IO wait (scan)" state.
    
    Looking for things that might get stuck if a goroutine got stuck in
    scanning a stack, we found that injectglist does:
    
            lock(&sched.lock)
            var n int
            for n = 0; glist != nil; n++ {
                    gp := glist
                    glist = gp.schedlink.ptr()
                    casgstatus(gp, _Gwaiting, _Grunnable)
                    globrunqput(gp)
            }
            unlock(&sched.lock)
    
    and that casgstatus spins on gp.atomicstatus until the _Gscan bit goes
    away. Essentially, this code locks sched.lock and then while holding
    sched.lock, waits to lock gp.atomicstatus.
    
    The code that is doing the scan is:
    
            if castogscanstatus(gp, s, s|_Gscan) {
                    if !gp.gcscandone {
                            scanstack(gp, gcw)
                            gp.gcscandone = true
                    }
                    restartg(gp)
                    break loop
            }
    
    More analysis showed that scanstack can, in a rare case, end up
    calling back into code that acquires sched.lock. For example:
    
            runtime.scanstack at proc.go:866
            calls runtime.gentraceback at mgcmark.go:842
            calls runtime.scanstack$1 at traceback.go:378
            calls runtime.scanframeworker at mgcmark.go:819
            calls runtime.scanblock at mgcmark.go:904
            calls runtime.greyobject at mgcmark.go:1221
            calls (*runtime.gcWork).put at mgcmark.go:1412
            calls (*runtime.gcControllerState).enlistWorker at mgcwork.go:127
            calls runtime.wakep at mgc.go:632
            calls runtime.startm at proc.go:1779
            acquires runtime.sched.lock at proc.go:1675
    
    This path was found with an automated deadlock-detecting tool.
    There are many such paths but they all go through enlistWorker -> wakep.
    
    The evidence strongly suggests that one of these paths is what caused
    the deadlock we observed. We're running those jobs with
    GOTRACEBACK=crash now to try to get more information if it happens
    again.
    
    Further refinement and analysis shows that if we drop the wakep call
    from enlistWorker, the remaining few deadlock cycles found by the tool
    are all false positives caused by not understanding the effect of calls
    to func variables.
    
    The enlistWorker -> wakep call was intended only as a performance
    optimization, it rarely executes, and if it does execute at just the
    wrong time it can (and plausibly did) cause the deadlock we saw.
    
    Comment it out, to avoid the potential deadlock.
    
    Fixes #19112.
    Unfixes #14179.
