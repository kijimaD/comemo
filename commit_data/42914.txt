    go/ast: note that in BasicLit CHARs and STRINGs are quoted
    
    The Value field of ast.BasicLit is a string field holding the literal
    string. For CHARs and STRINGs, the BasicLit.Value literal includes
    quotes, so to use the value in practise one will often need to Unquote
    it.
    
    Since this is a common gotcha (I've been bitten by this a few times),
    document it, and suggest the use of the strconv.Unquote functions.
    
    Fixes #39590
