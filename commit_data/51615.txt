    runtime: fix performance regression in morestack_noctxt on ppc64
    
    In the fix for 54332 the MOVD R1, R1 instruction was added to
    morestack_noctxt function to set the SPWRITE bit. However, the
    instruction MOVD R1, R1 results in or r1,r1,r1 which is a special
    instruction on ppc64 architecture as it changes the thread priority
    and can negatively impact performance in some cases.
    More details on such similar nops can be found in Power ISA v3.1
    Book II on Power ISA Virtual Environment architecture in the chapter
    on Program Priority Registers and Or instructions.
    Replacing this by OR R0, R1 has the same affect on setting SPWRITE as
    needed by the first fix but does not affect thread priority and
    hence does not cause the degradation in performance
