    [dev.link] cmd/link: resolve ABI aliases for external symbols
    
    ABI alias references in Go symbols are resolved during
    loadObjFull. But for external symbols they are not resolved. If
    there is a reference from an external symbol to a Go ABIInternal
    symbol, this reference will be invalid as it is not resolved.
    
    The old code resolve ABI aliases in the deadcode pass. But the
    new deadcode pass doesn't do it, as it works with indices instead
    of Symbols. We do this in LoadFull.
    
    This makes all internal cgo linking tests pass on Mach-O.
