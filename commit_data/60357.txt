    cmd/compile: update README to reflect dead code elimination changes
    
    The description of middle-end dead code elimination is inconsistent with the current implementation.
    
    The early dead code elimination pass of IR nodes is no longer located in cmd/compile/internal/deadcode and is no longer called by gc/main.go:Main. It has been moved to the unified IR writer phase. This update modifies the README to reflect this architectural change.
