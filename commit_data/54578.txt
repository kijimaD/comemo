    path/filepath: reuse os.ReadDir
    
    While reading the source code, I noticed that readDir
    seemed extremely similar to os.ReadDir. They indeed appear to be copies.
    
    Note that there's readDirNames as well, but it has no corresponding
    os.ReadDirNames top-level helper to be replaced by.
