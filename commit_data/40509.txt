    test: skip cross-arch codegen tests in all.bash
    
    The test/codegen tests check all architectures
    mentioned in the test file, but this requires
    building at least the runtime for that architecture.
    This CL changes the test to only check the local
    architecture, leaving checking of other architectures
    to the relevant builders, as usual.
    
    This cuts 'go run run.go codegen' by 12r 78u 21s.
    
    After this change, all.bash runs in ~4:40 on my laptop.
    
    For #26473.
