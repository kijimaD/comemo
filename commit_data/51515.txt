commit 3e514a0103a7e335c70104435555229f51e4d9ae
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 8 09:47:46 2022 -0800

    spec: explicitly define integer, floating-point, and complex types
    
    The terms "integer type", "floating-point type", and "complex type"
    are used frequently in the spec but are not explicitly (only indirectly)
    defined.
    
    Slightly rephrased the section on numeric types and introduce these
    terms explicitly. Add links to this section.
