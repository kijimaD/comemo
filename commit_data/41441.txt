    cmd/compile: pick position of implicit break statements more carefully
    
    The previous version used the position of the switch statement,
    which makes for potentially jumpy stepping and introduces a large
    number of statements repeating the line (tricky for inserting
    breaks).  It also shared a single OBREAK node and this was not
    really a syntax "tree".
    
    This improves both the nostmt test (by 6 lines) and
    reduces the total badness score from dwarf-goodness (by about 200).
