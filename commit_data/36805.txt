    runtime: don't disable GC work caching during mark termination
    
    Currently, we disable GC work caching during mark termination. This is
    no longer necessary with the new mark completion detection because
    
    1. There's no way for any of the GC mark termination helpers to have
    any real work queued and,
    
    2. Mark termination has to explicitly flush every P's buffers anyway
    in order to flush Ps that didn't run a GC mark termination helper.
    
    Hence, remove the code that disposes gcWork buffers during mark
    termination.
    
    Updates #26903. This is a follow-up to eliminating mark 2.
