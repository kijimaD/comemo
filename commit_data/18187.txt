    cmd/go: test: do not put object files where later steps will find them
    
    When recompiling a package whose basename is the name of a standard
    package for testing with gccgo, a .o file with the basename of the
    package being tested was being placed in the _test/ directory where the
    compilation of the test binary then found it when looking for the
    standard library package.
    
    This change puts the object files in a separate directory.
    
    Fixes #6793
