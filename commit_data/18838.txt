    runtime: efence support for growable stacks
    1. Fix the bug that shrinkstack returns memory to heap.
       This causes growslice to misbehave (it manually initialized
       blocks, and in efence mode shrinkstack's free leads to
       partially-initialized blocks coming out of growslice.
       Which in turn causes GC to crash while treating the garbage
       as Eface/Iface.
    2. Enable efence for stack segments.
