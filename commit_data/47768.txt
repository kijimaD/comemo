    cmd/compile/abi-internal: declare R14 completely fixed
    
    Currently, we allow R14, the current goroutine pointer, to be
    clobbered in function bodies as long as the function restores it. This
    is unnecessary complexity and could lead to confusing inconsistencies
    with other architectures that can't simply restore it from TLS.
    
    Updates #40724.
