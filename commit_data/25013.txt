    html/template: Add missing error check to package example.
    
    This appears to be an unintended omission. The check func is declared
    just above, and the err value from template.Parse is captured rather
    than discarded via blank identifier. All following calls that similarly
    return err are checked, so it can't be that this example elides error
    checking for brevity. Finally, if you look at Example_autoescaping,
    it does check err from template.Parse and its code is very similar.
