    runtime: run safe-point function before entering _Psyscall
    
    Currently, we run a P's safe-point function immediately after entering
    _Psyscall state. This is unsafe, since as soon as we put the P in
    _Psyscall, we no longer control the P and another M may claim it.
    We'll still run the safe-point function only once (because doing so
    races on an atomic), but the P may no longer be at a safe-point when
    we do so.
    
    In particular, this means that the use of forEachP to dispose all P's
    gcw caches is unsafe. A P may enter a syscall, run the safe-point
    function, and dispose the P's gcw cache concurrently with another M
    claiming the P and attempting to use its gcw cache. If this happens,
    we may empty the gcw's workbuf after putting it on
    work.{full,partial}, or add pointers to it after putting it in
    work.empty. This will cause an assertion failure when we later pop the
    workbuf from the list and its object count is inconsistent with the
    list we got it from.
    
    Fix this by running the safe-point function just before putting the P
    in _Psyscall.
    
    Related to #11640. This probably fixes this issue, but while I'm able
    to show that we can enter a bad safe-point state as a result of this,
    I can't reproduce that specific failure.
