    cmd/compile/internal/pgo: use slices for in/out edges
    
    Currently in the pprof Graph, a Node's in/out edges are
    represented as maps, keyed by the source/destination Nodes. For a
    Node it usually has a very small number of edges, so linear search
    would be generally faster than map operations. Use slices and
    linear search instead.
