    cmd/go: update "go help doc" docs
    
    This CL updates "go help doc" docs so they reflect the following
    changes:
    
    - CL 59413 modified "go doc", so the behavior of the two-args case is
      consistent with the one-arg one.
    - CL 141397 removed godoc's command-line interface in favor of "go doc".
    
    Fixes #49830.
