    cmd/go: only run TestGoGetHTTPS404 where it works
    
    The test TestGoGetHTTPS404 downloads a package that does not build on
    every OS, so change it to only run where the package builds. It's not
    great for the test to depend on an external package, but this is an
    improvement on the current situation.
    
    Fixes #15644.
