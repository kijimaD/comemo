    cmd/compile: fix TypeDefn to deal with node with no Ntype set
    
    Adjust TypeDefn(), which is used by reportTypeLoop(), to work for nodes
    with no Ntype set (which are all nodes in -G=3 mode). Normally,
    reportTypeLoop() would not be called, because the types2 typechecker
    would have already caught it. This is a possible way to report an
    unusual type loop involving type params, which is not being caught by
    the types2 type checker.
