    cmd/compile: load builtin export data only once
    
    Previously, the builtin runtime export data was reparsed before every
    Go source file, and the unsafe export data was reparsed for every
    import of package unsafe.  Now, we parse both of them just once ahead
    of time.
    
    This does mean package unsafe's export data will be loaded even when
    compiling packages that don't import it, but it's tiny anyway.
