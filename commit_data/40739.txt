    crypto/x509: fix CreateCRL for Ed25519 CAs
    
    This makes Ed25519 certificates work for CreateCRL(). This previously
    failed (panic: crypto: requested hash function #0 is unavailable) because
    the hash could not be skipped, but Ed25519 uses no hash.
    
    A similar fix has been applied in a few other places when Ed25519 was added
    when Ed25519 certificates were originally introduced, but was missed
    here.
