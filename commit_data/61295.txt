    Revert "crypto/rand: add randcrash=0 GODEBUG"
    
    A GODEBUG is actually a security risk here: most programs will start to
    ignore errors from Read because they can't happen (which is the intended
    behavior), but then if a program is run with GODEBUG=randcrash=0 it will
    use a partial buffer in case an error occurs, which may be catastrophic.
    
    Note that the proposal was accepted without the GODEBUG, which was only
    added later.
    
    This (partially) reverts CL 608435. I kept the tests.
    
    Updates #66821
