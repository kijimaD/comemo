    cmd/5g, cmd/6g, cmd/8g: fix line number of caller of deferred func
    
    Deferred functions are not run by a call instruction. They are run by
    the runtime editing registers to make the call start with a caller PC
    returning to a
            CALL deferreturn
    instruction.
    
    That instruction has always had the line number of the function's
    closing brace, but that instruction's line number is irrelevant.
    Stack traces show the line number of the instruction before the
    return PC, because normally that's what started the call. Not so here.
    The instruction before the CALL deferreturn could be almost anywhere
    in the function; it's unrelated and its line number is incorrect to show.
    
    Fix the line number by inserting a true hardware no-op with the right
    line number before the returned-to CALL instruction. That is, the deferred
    calls now appear to start with a caller PC returning to the second instruction
    in this sequence:
            NOP
            CALL deferreturn
    
    The traceback will show the line number of the NOP, which we've set
    to be the line number of the function's closing brace.
    
    The NOP here is not the usual pseudo-instruction, which would be
    elided by the linker. Instead it is the real hardware instruction:
    XCHG AX, AX on 386 and amd64, and AND.EQ R0, R0, R0 on ARM.
    
    Fixes #5856.
