    runtime: use atomic.Cas to change timerRemoved to timerWaiting
    
    If multiple goroutines call time.(*Timer).Reset then the timer will go
    from timerWaiting to timerDeleted to timerModifying to timerModifiedLater.
    The timer can be on a different P, meaning that simultaneously cleantimers
    could change it from timerDeleted to timerRemoving to timerRemoved.
    If Reset sees timerRemoved, it was doing an atomic.Store of timerWaiting,
    meaning that it did not necessarily see the other values set in the timer,
    so the timer could appear to be in an inconsistent state. Use atomic.Cas
    to avoid that possibility.
