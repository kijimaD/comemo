    encoding/csv: document that Writer is buffered
    
    Add documentation that individual Write calls are buffered and
    copy documentation from bufio.Writer notifying the user to call
    Flush and Error when all writes are complete. Remove reference
    to "file" since the implementation is general and allows any
    io.Writer.
    
    Fixes #30045
