    cmd/compile/internal/gc: don't iterate over field list twice
    
    In tostruct0 and tofunargs we take a list of nodes, transform them into
    a slice of Fields, set the fields on a type, then use the IterFields
    iterator to iterate over the list again to see if any of them are
    broken.
    
    As we know the slice of fielde-we just created it-we can combine these two
    interations into one pass over the fields.
