    syscall: skip non-root user namespace test if kernel forbids
    
    The unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl prevents unpriviledged users from
    creating namespaces, which the AmbientCaps test does. It's set to 0 by
    default in a few Linux distributions (Debian and Arch, possibly
    others), so we need to check it before running the test.
    
    I've verified that setting
    
      echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone
    
    and then running the test *without this patch* makes it pass, which
    proves that checking unprivileged_userns_clone is indeed sufficient.
    
    Fixes #30698
