    cmd/compile: revert CL/316890
    
    This is a revert of https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/316890,
    which has positive effects on debugging + DWARF variable locations
    for register parameters when the reg abi is in effect, but also
    turns out to interact badly with the register allocator.
    
    Fixes #46304.
