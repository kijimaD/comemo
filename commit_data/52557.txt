    cmd/link/internal/ld: don't set IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED on PE binaries
    
    The IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED characteristic is used to inform that
    the debugging information have been removed from the PE files and moved
    into a DBG file, but the Go linker doesn't generate DBG files.
    
    Having this characteristic can confuse debugging tools, so better
    don't set it.
    
    While here, remove also IMAGE_FILE_LINE_NUMS_STRIPPED, which is
    deprecated and should be zero [1].
    
    Fixes #59391
