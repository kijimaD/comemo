    misc/dashboard/codereview: show first line of last message in thread
    
    This line helps me to tell whether the CL is waiting for me or I'm waiting for the author.
    
    Also:
     - vertical-align table cells so buttons are always aligned with CL headers.
     - add email= to show front page for someone else.
    
     Demo at http://rsc.gocodereview.appspot.com/.
     Until this is deployed for real, some recently changed CLs may be
     missing the 'first line of last message' part.
