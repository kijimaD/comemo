    runtime: use uintXX instead of *byte for si_addr on Darwin
    
    Currently, Darwin's siginfo type uses *byte for the si_addr
    field. This results in unwanted write barriers in set_sigaddr. It's
    also pointless since it never points to anything real and the get/set
    methods return/take uintXX and cast it from/to the pointer.
    
    All other arches use a uint type for this field. Change Darwin to
    match. This simplifies the get/set methods and eliminates the unwanted
    write barriers.
