    cmd/compile: more error position tests for the typechecker
    
    This change adds line position tests for several yyerror calls in the
    typechecker that are currently not tested in any way.
    
    Untested yyerror calls were found by replacing them with
    
      yerrorl(src.NoXPos, ...)
    
    (thus destroying position information in the error), and then running
    the test suite. No failures means no test coverage for the relevant
    yyerror call.
    
    For #19683
