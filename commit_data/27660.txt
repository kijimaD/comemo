    time: genzabbrs.go skips Feb when checking months
    
    getAbbrs looks like it is checking each month looking for a change
    in the time zone abbreviation, but starts in Dec of the previous year
    and skips the month of February because of the overflow rules for
    AddDate. Changing the day to 1 starts at Jan 1 and tries all months
    in the current year. This isn't very important or likely to change
    output as zones usually span several months. Discovered when
    looking into time.AddDate behavior when adding months.
