    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: support SWPD/SWPW/SWPH/SWPB
    
    SWPD/SWPW/SWPH/SWPB were introduced in ARMv8.1. They swap content
    of register and memory atomically. And their difference is
    SWPD: 64-bit double word data
    SWPW: 32-bit word data (zero extended to 64-bit)
    SWPH: 16-bit half word data (zero extended to 64-bit)
    SWPB: 8-bit byte data (zero extended to 64-bit)
    
    This CL implements them in the arm64 assembler.
