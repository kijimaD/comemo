    runtime/pprof: remove "deleted" suffix while parsing maps file
    
    If binary file of a running program was deleted or moved, maps
    file (/proc/pid/maps) will contain lines that have this binary
    filename suffixed with "(deleted)" string. This suffix stayed
    as a part of the filename and made remote profiling slightly more
    difficult by requiring from a user to rename binary file to
    include this suffix.
    
    This change cleans up the filename and removes this suffix and
    thus simplify debugging.
    
    Fixes #25740
