    cmd/go: skip long tests in -short mode
    
    I marked every test that takes more than 0.5 seconds on my machine
    as something to run only when not in -short mode, or in -short mode
    on the beefy linux/amd64, windows/amd64, and darwin/amd64 builders.
    
    I also shortened a few needlessly-expensive tests where possible.
    
    Cuts the time for go test -short cmd/go from 45s to 15s on my machine.
    Should help even more on some of our builders and slower user machines.
    
    Fixes #23287.
