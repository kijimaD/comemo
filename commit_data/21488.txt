    runtime: improve GC times printing
    
    This improves the printing of GC times to be both more human-friendly
    and to provide enough information for the construction of MMU curves
    and other statistics.  The new times look like:
    
    GC: #8 72413852ns @143036695895725 pause=622900 maxpause=427037 goroutines=11 gomaxprocs=4
    GC:     sweep term: 190584ns       max=190584   total=275001    procs=4
    GC:     scan:       260397ns       max=260397   total=902666    procs=1
    GC:     install wb: 5279ns         max=5279     total=18642     procs=4
    GC:     mark:       71530555ns     max=71530555 total=186694660 procs=1
    GC:     mark term:  427037ns       max=427037   total=1691184   procs=4
    
    This prints gomaxprocs and the number of procs used in each phase for
    the benefit of analyzing mutator utilization during concurrent phases.
    This also means the analysis doesn't have to hard-code which phases
    are STW.
    
    This prints the absolute start time only for the GC cycle.  The other
    start times can be derived from the phase durations.  This declutters
    the view for humans readers and doesn't pose any additional complexity
    for machine readers.
    
    This removes the confusing "cycle" terminology.  Instead, this places
    the phase duration after the phase name and adds a "ns" unit, which
    both makes it implicitly clear that this is the duration of that phase
    and indicates the units of the times.
    
    This adds a "GC:" prefix to all lines for easier identification.
    
    Finally, this generally cleans up the code as well as the placement of
    spaces in the output and adds print locking so the statistics blocks
    are never interrupted by other prints.
