    testing: fix divide by zero when benchmark is faster than OS's clock resolution
    
    I did not added a test because `benchmark_test.go` is `package testing_test`
    and I don't care to change that because calling predictN is not testing the
    thing I would want to test.
    
    Ideally we would run benchmark in a VM with a highjacked clocksource that never
    marches forward, or using faketime but that looks fairly involved for a quickie
    fix.
    
    Fixes #70709
