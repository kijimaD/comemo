    net/http/httptest: delete TestIssue7264
    
    Now it's failing on Windows:
    
    panic: httptest: failed to listen on a port: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:0:
    listen: An operation on a socket could not be performed because the
    system lacked sufficient buffer space or because a queue was full.
    
    Since we can't seem to understand what the test is trying to test,
    and because it is causing problems on multiple systems,
    delete it.
    
    Fixes #7264.
