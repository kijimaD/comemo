    syscall: ensure Mkdir(path) on Plan 9 fails if path exists
    
    On Plan 9, the underlying create() syscall with DMDIR flag, which is
    used to implement Mkdir, will fail silently if the path exists and
    is not a directory.  Work around this by checking for existence
    first and rejecting Mkdir with error EEXIST if the path is found.
    
    Fixes #23918
