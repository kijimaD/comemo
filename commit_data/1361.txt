commit 4d23030859398c2a17243c878f0abb98f3074204
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    - ripped out excessively fancy way of describing grammar
      in favor of explicit constructs
    - simpler, clearer, and shorter overall
    - no spec changes
    
    (in retrospect it was just a (my) mistake to put it in in the first place)
