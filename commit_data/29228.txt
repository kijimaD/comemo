    math/rand: document that NewSource sources race
    
    While it was previously explicitly documented that "the default Source"
    is safe for concurrent use, a careless reader can interpret that as
    meaning "the implementation of the Source interface created by functions
    in this package" rather than "the default shared Source used by
    top-level functions". Be explicit that the Source returned by NewSource
    is not safe for use by multiple goroutines.
    
    Fixes #3611.
