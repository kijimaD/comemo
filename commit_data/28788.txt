    crypto/tls: fix printing of OpenSSL output when updating a test fails.
    
    When updating the test data against OpenSSL, the handshake can fail and
    the stdout/stderr output of OpenSSL is very useful in finding out why.
    
    However, printing that output has been broken for some time because its
    no longer sent to a byte.Buffer. This change fixes that.
