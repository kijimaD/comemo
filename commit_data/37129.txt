    testing/cover: improve comments on CoverBlock
    
    The previous CL (https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/96756)
    added comments that didn't really say much, but there is something
    so say: what the units are and that they are indexed starting at 1.
    
    Add a more helpful comment on the type, and also follow proper
    style by using initial capitals and a period.
