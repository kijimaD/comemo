    [dev.link] cmd: convert symbol "shared" flag to object file flag
    
    For the new object file format, don't tag individual symbols with a
    "shared" flag, since that characteristic is better off as an attribute
    of the containing object file as opposed to the individual symbol. Add
    a new flags field in the object file header and put a bit in the flags
    if the shared flags is in effect during compilation.
