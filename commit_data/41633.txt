    cmd/cover: skip function declarations with blank names
    
    Function declarations with blank ("_") names do not introduce a binding,
    and therefore cannot be referenced or executed (in fact, they do not
    make it into the final compiled binary at all). As such, counters
    defined while annotating their bodies will always be zero.
    
    These types of functions are commonly used to create compile-time
    checks (e.g., stringer) which are not expected to be executed.
    
    Skip over these functions when annotating a file, preventing the unused
    counters from being generated and appearing as uncovered lines in
    coverage reports.
    
    Fixes #36264
