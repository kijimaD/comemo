    cmd/go/internal/modfetch: wrap errors from HTTP response bodies
    
    The Read method on the Body returned from a net/http.Transport does
    not wrap errors returned by the underlying io.Reader and returns a
    bare io.ErrUnexpectedEOF if the body is shorter than the declared
    Content-Length.
    
    Since we can't feasibly add detail on the net/http side without
    breaking established users, we must instead add detail on the caller
    side. Since the net/http client uses url.Error for most of its own
    errors, we use that same error type here.
    
    I have not added a regression test for this change. (While it is
    theoretically possible to set up a GOPROXY that returns incorrect
    Content-Length headers, the change seems straightforward enough that
    it isn't worth the complex test setup.)
    
    Fixes #52727.
