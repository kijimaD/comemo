    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: rename types.Type.{Short,Long}String to {Link,Name}String
    
    The original names "ShortString" and "LongString" refer back to the
    fmt verbs used to request their formatting styles. However, I always
    get confused working with them, in particular because (1) the
    "ShortString" description, which uses package-path qualification, is
    actually generally longer than the "LongString" description, which
    uses package-name qualification; and (2) the documentation mentions
    how they're often used, but doesn't actually describe why they're safe
    for those purposes.
    
    This CL renames them to "LinkString" and "NameString", respectively,
    based on their primary use cases. It also attempts to more completely
    describe the strings they return and how they can be used correctly.
