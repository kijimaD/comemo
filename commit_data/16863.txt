    log/syslog: restore use of serverConn interface
    
    Revision 15629 (8d71734a0cb0) removed the serverConn interface
    that was introduce in revision 7718 (ee5e80c62862).  The
    serverConn interface was there for use by gccgo on Solaris,
    and it is still needed there.  Solaris does not support
    connecting to the syslog daemon over TCP, and gccgo simply
    calls the C library function.  This CL restores the
    interface.
