    cmd/link: fix incorrect DOS header on Windows binaries
    
    The previous DOS header placed on Windows binaries was incorrect, as it had e_crlc (number of relocations) set to 4, instead of e_cparhdr (size of header in 16-bit words) set to 4. This resulted in execution starting at the beginning of the file, instead of where the DOS stub code actually exists.
    
    Fixes #57834
