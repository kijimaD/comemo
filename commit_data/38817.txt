    cmd/go/internal/{clean,test}: lock testexpire.txt
    
    Also check to make sure we don't overwrite a newer timestamp with an
    older one.
    
    testexpire.txt may be written concurrently, and a partially-written
    timestamp may appear much older than the actual intended one. We don't
    want to re-run tests that should still be cached.
    
    Updates #26794
