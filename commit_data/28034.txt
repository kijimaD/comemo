    os: use runtime.Keepalive for *Process values
    
    The os package sets a finalizer on *Process. I looked through all the
    uses of *Process in the package, looking for each case where a *Process
    was passed as an argument and the final reference to the argument was
    not a function or method call. I added a call to runtime.KeepAlive after
    each such final reference (there were only three).
    
    The code is safe today without the KeepAlive calls because the compiler
    keeps arguments alive for the duration of the function. However, that is
    not a language requirement, so adding the KeepAlive calls ensures that
    this code remains safe even if the compiler changes in the future.
    
    I also removed an existing unnecessry call to runtime.KeepAlive. The
    syscall.Syscall function is handled specially by the compiler to keep
    its arguments alive.
