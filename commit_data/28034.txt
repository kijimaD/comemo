    runtime: remove stack barriers during sweep
    
    This adds a best-effort pass to remove stack barriers immediately
    after the end of mark termination. This isn't necessary for the Go
    runtime, but should help external tools that perform stack walks but
    aren't aware of Go's stack barriers such as GDB, perf, and VTune.
    (Though clearly they'll still have trouble unwinding stacks during
    mark.)
