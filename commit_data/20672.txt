    cmd/yacc: fix handling of tokens that don't start with letters
    
    CL 149110043 changed yacc to no longer keep a leading space
    for quoted tokens.  That is OK by itself but unfortunately
    yacc was relying on that leading space to notice which tokens
    it should not output as const declarations.
    
    Add a few such tokens to expr.y, although it won't make any
    immediate difference as we seem to have no tests for yacc.
