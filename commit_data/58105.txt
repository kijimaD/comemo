    cmd/dist: add GOFIPS140 setting
    
    GOFIPS140 will be used to control whether to build binaries that
    run in FIPS-140 mode by default, as well as which version of
    crypto/internal/fips is used during a given build.
    It is a target configuration variable analogous to
    GOOS, GOARCH, CGO_ENABLED, and the like, so the
    default value is recorded in the toolchain during make.bash.
    
    This CL adds the GOFIPS140 setting to the build process
    and records the default for use by cmd/go.
    
    For #70200.
