    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: speed up cse
    
    By walking only the current set of partitions
    at any given point, the cse pass ended up doing
    lots of extraneous, effectively O(n^2) work.
    
    Using a regular for loop allows each cse pass to
    make as much progress as possible by processing
    each new class as it is introduced.
    
    This can and should be optimized further,
    but it already reduces by 75% cse time on test/slice3.go.
    
    The overall time to compile test/slice3.go is still
    dominated by the O(n^2) work in the liveness pass.
    However, Keith is rewriting regalloc anyway.
