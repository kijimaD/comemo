    cmd/go: declare runtime/cgo dependency for darwin/arm, darwin/arm64 tests
    
    I don't know why these tests must import runtime/cgo
    in _testmain.go, but if they must, they must also tell the
    rest of the go command that they are doing so.
    
    Should fix the newly-broken darwin/arm and darwin/arm64 builders.
