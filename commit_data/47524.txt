    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of expr.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/expr.go
    and expr.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker.
    
    The primary differences to go/types/expr.go are:
    - use of package syntax rather than ast
    - no reporting of error codes in errors
    - implicit conversions of untyped nil lead to a typed nil
      (in go/types, nil remains untyped)
