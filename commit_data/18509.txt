    cmd/gc: relax address-of escape analysis
    
    Make the loop nesting depth of &x depend on where x is declared,
    not on where the &x appears. The latter is only a conservative
    estimate of the former. Being more careful can avoid some
    variables escaping, and it is easier to reason about.
    
    It would have avoided issue 7313, although that was still a bug
    worth fixing.
    
    Not much effect in the tree: one variable in the whole tree
    is saved from a heap allocation (something in x509 parsing).
