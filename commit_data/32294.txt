    cmd/compile: collapse runs of string constants in walkprint
    
    This reduces the code footprint of code like:
    
    println("foo=", foo, "bar=", bar)
    
    which is fairly common in the runtime.
    
    Prior to this change, this makes function calls to print each of:
    
    "foo=", " ", foo, " ", "bar=", " ", bar, "\n"
    
    After this change, this prints:
    
    "foo= ", foo, " bar= ", bar, "\n"
    
    This shrinks the hello world binary by 0.4%.
    More importantly, this improves the instruction
    density of important runtime routines.
