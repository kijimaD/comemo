    net: only enable broadcast on sockets which support it
    
    Only enable broadcast on SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets, SOCK_STREAM
    and others don't support it.
    
    Don't enable SO_BROADCAST on UNIX domain sockets as they don't support it.
    
    This caused failures on WSL which strictly checks setsockopt calls
    unlike other OSes which often silently ignore bad options.
    
    Also return error for setsockopt call for SO_BROADCAST on Windows
    matching all other platforms but for IPv4 only as it's not supported
    on IPv6 as per:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/socket-options
    
    Fixes #38954
