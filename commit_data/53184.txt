    [dev.unified] cmd/compile: move "has init" to private metadata
    
    Currently, there's a "has init" bool in the public metadata section,
    which is only needed by cmd/compile; but because it's in the public
    metadata section, it's known to the go/types importers too. This CL
    moves it instead to the new compiler-only private metadata section
    added in the last CL for the inline bodies index.
    
    The existing bool in the public metadata section is left in place, and
    just always set to false, to avoid breaking the x/tools importer. The
    next time we bump the export version number, we can remove the bool
    properly. But no urgency just yet.
