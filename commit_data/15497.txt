    cmd/cgo: extend implementation comment
    
    This is the plan for how to make host linking work with
    the rest of the system.
    
    There are two complications:
    
    1. It is a goal to preserve the property that pure Go programs
    (even ones importing "net") can be compiled without needing
    gcc, so that a Go toolchain download works out of the box.
    This forces the support for two linking modes: with and without
    gcc.
    
    2. It is a goal to allow users with old copies of SWIG to continue
    to use those copies. This forces the support for "internal only"
    packages. Perhaps it is reasonable to require a new SWIG.
    I don't know.
