    build: change how cmd/api is run in run.bash and run.bat
    
    In prep for Robert's forthcoming cmd/api rewrite which
    depends on the go.tools subrepo, we'll need to be more
    careful about how and when we run cmd/api.
    
    Rather than implement this policy in both run.bash and
    run.bat, this change moves the policy and mechanism into
    cmd/api/run.go, which will then evolve.
    
    The plan is in a TODO in run.go.
