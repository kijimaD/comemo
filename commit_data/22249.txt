    misc/ios: add go_darwin_arm_exec script
    
    This script is getting very close to complete, and is complex enough
    that I'd like to get what's there so far reviewed. With it the builder
    is left failing on eight packages. Two of those involve correcting
    GOROOT which may need modifications to this script, the others are
    either a unix sockets bug I have to hunt down or are caused by lldb
    getting stuck on SIGSEGV, a TODO.
