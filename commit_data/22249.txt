    cmd/go: always link external test packages first when using gccgo
    
    This CL is an amagamation of several fixes Canonical have made on their
    fork of the cmd/go tool (packaged as gccgo-go.deb on Ubuntu 14.04+).
    
    Additionally this CL brings gccgoToolchain.ldi() up to date with the version
    that will ship in gccgo-5.0. As gccgo is most likely to be used with its
    own version of the go tool that it supples it makes good sense that the libgo
    version should dictate the contents of gccgotoolchain.ld()
    
    Please see https://codereview.appspot.com/222890043/ for more details on the
    issues fixed.
