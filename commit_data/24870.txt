    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: run std tests with SSA codegen as part of all.bash
    
    Todd Neal has made all the stdlib tests pass.
    Now the trybots and build dashboard can
    help us keep them passing.
    
    All of this code will be unwound bit by bit
    as SSA matures and then becomes the default.
