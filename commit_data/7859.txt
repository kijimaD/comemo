    go/parser: resolve identifiers properly
    
    Correctly distinguish between lhs and rhs identifiers
    and resolve/declare them accordingly.
    
    Collect field and method names in respective scopes
    (will be available after some minor AST API changes).
    
    Also collect imports since it's useful to have that
    list directly w/o having to re-traverse the AST
    (will also be available after some minor AST API changes).
    
    No external API changes in this CL.
