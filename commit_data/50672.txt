    cmd/compile: gracefully fallback when inline bodies are missing
    
    Currently, we rely on a "crawling" step during export to identify
    function and method bodies that need to be exported or re-exported so
    we can trim out unnecessary ones and reduce build artifact sizes. To
    catch cases where we expect a function to be inlinable but we failed
    to export its body, we made this condition a fatal compiler error.
    
    However, with generics, it's much harder to perfectly identify all
    function bodies that need to be exported; and several attempts at
    tweaking the algorithm have resulted in still having failure cases.
    So for now, this CL changes a missing inline body into a graceful
    failure instead.
