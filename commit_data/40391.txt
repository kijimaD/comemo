    internal/syscall/windows/registry: blacklist certain registry keys in TestWalkFullRegistry
    
    It turns out that Windows has "legitimate" keys that have bogus type
    values or bogus lengths that don't correspond with their type. On up to
    date Windows 10 systems, this test always fails for this reason. These
    keys exist because of bugs in Microsoft's code. This commit works around
    the problem by simply blacklisting known instances. It also expands the
    error message a bit so that we can make adjustments should the problem
    ever happen again, and reformats the messages so that it makes copy and
    pasting into the blacklist easier.
