    cmd/go: prevent infinite loop in QueryPackage()
    
    p = path.Dir(p) converges to either "." or "/". The current
    implementation of modload.QueryPackage() has a loop that
    terminates only on ".", not "/". This leads to the go command
    hanging in an infinite loop if the user manages to supply
    a file path starting with "/" as package path.
    
    An example of the issue is if the user (incorrectly) attempts
    to use an absolute directory path in an import statement within
    a module (import "/home/bob/myproj") and then runs go list.
    
    Fixes #27558
