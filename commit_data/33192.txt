    [dev.debug] cmd/link: let the linker combine .debug_ranges, remove globals
    
    The linker is pretty good at combining a bunch of symbols into a
    section, so let it do .debug_ranges the normal way. Along the way,
    remove a bunch of globals that were only used by one function that would
    only be called once per invocation.
