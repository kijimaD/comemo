    net/http: check server shutting down before processing the request
    
    The root cause of issue #65802 is a small race condition that occurs between
    two events:
    
    1. During the HTTP server shutdown, a connection in an idle state is identified
    and closed.
    2. The connection, although idle, has just finished reading a complete request
    before being closed and hasn't yet updated its state to active.
    
    In this scenario, despite the connection being closed, the request continues to
    be processed. This not only wastes server resources but also prevents the
    client request from being retried.
    
    Fixes #65802
