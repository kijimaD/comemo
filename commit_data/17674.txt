    fmt: one bad index shouldn't spoil them all
    
    In an indexed verb such as %[3]d, if the index is out of range, don't
    skip processing the rest of the verbs. The bug was that the bad
    index set a bit for the whole format instead of just the verb.
    
    Ok for 1.2 because this is a bug in a 1.2 feature.
    
    Fixes #6434
