    runtime: acquire timersLocks around moveTimers
    
    In the discussion of CL 171828 we decided that it was not necessary to
    acquire timersLock around the call to moveTimers, because the world is
    stopped. However, that is not correct, as sysmon runs even when the world
    is stopped, and it calls timeSleepUntil which looks through the timers.
    timeSleepUntil acquires timersLock, but that doesn't help if moveTimers
    is running at the same time.
