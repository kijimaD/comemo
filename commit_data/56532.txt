    cmd/internal/bootstrap_test: update TestExperimentToolID for Go 1.21
    
    This test is configured to run only when explicitly requested due to
    being costly. Apply two updates so it can run on the toolchain today:
    
    - overlay GOROOT/lib for zoneinfo.zip (similarly to CL 462279)
    - stop expecting framepointer to be listed in the GOEXPERIMENT
      section of the compiler version (see CL 49252 and CL 249857)
    
    I checked if by now there's another test that would report a problem
    if the fix made in CL 186200 had regressed. Running all.bash locally
    with GO_TEST_SHORT=0 GO_BUILDER_NAME=darwin-arm64-longtest passed ok,
    while this manual test did catch the problem.
    
    Also simplify the test implementation while here so it's less different
    from TestRepeatBootstrap.
    
    For #33091.
