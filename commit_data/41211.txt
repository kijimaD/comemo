    doc/go1.14: move "Minor changes to the library" heading up
    
    This heading was below the minor changes to the standard library.
    It should be on top.
    
    Many of the minor changes have been documented, so remove the broad
    TODO comment. It is still a TODO to highlight more prominent changes
    to the library, if there are any, under the "Core library" heading.
    
    Updates #36878
