    cmd/compile: handle blank struct fields in NumComponents
    
    NumComponents is used by racewalk to decide whether reads and writes
    might occur to subobjects of an address. For that purpose,
    blank fields matter.
    
    It is also used to decide whether to inline == and != for a type.
    For that purpose, blank fields may be ignored.
    
    Add a parameter to NumComponents to support this distinction.
    While we're here, document NumComponents, as requested in CL 59334.
