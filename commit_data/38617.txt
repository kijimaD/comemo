    cmd/compile: use FmtLeft to generate symbol name for unexported interface methods
    
    The bug in 29612 is that there are two similar-looking anonymous interface
    types in two different packages, ./p1/ssa and ./p2/ssa:
    
    v.(interface{ foo() }).foo()
    
    These types should be treated differently because the unexported method
    makes the types different (according to the spec).
    
    But when generating the type descriptors for those two types, they
    both have the name "interface { ssa.foo() }". They thus get the same
    symbol, and the linker happily unifies them. It picks an arbitrary one
    for the runtime to use, but that breaks conversions from concrete types
    that have a foo method from the package which had its interface type
    overwritten.
    
    We need to encode the metadata symbol for unexported methods as package
    path qualified (The same as we did in CL 27791 for struct fields).
    
    So switching from FmtUnsigned to Fmtleft by default fixes the issue.
    In case of generating namedata, FmtUnsigned is used.
    
    The benchmark result ends up in no significant change of compiled binary
    compare to the immediate parent.
    
    Fixes #29612
