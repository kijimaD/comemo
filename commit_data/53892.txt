    runtime/pprof: correct field alignment in machVMRegionBasicInfoData
    
    The type machVMRegionBasicInfoData is generated from C type
    vm_region_basic_info_data_64_t, which is a packed struct with a
    64-bit field at offset 20. We cannot use uint64 as the field type
    in the Go struct, as that will be aligned at offset 24, which does
    not match the C struct. Change back to [8]byte (which is what the
    cgo command generates), but keep the name Offset.
    
    Updates #61707.
    Updates #50891.
