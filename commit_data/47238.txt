commit 2cf85b1fb8b3b6629b834016735ddeaaf7b96fda

    cmd/compile/internal/types2: implement compiler helper functions without using under
    
    These functions are exported for the compiler and are used after
    type checking is finished. There is no need to call under() in
    their implementations; they can rely entirely on the public API.
    This opens the door to moving them into the compiler eventually.
    They may also be slightly more efficient.
