    cmd/link: fix SCONST symbol handling on darwin
    
    Don't include SCONST symbols in the symbol table when
    NotInSymbolTable is set. This is what the old code (genasmsym)
    does.
    
    In fact, SCONST symbol is only emitted by the field tracking
    code, and is always NotInSymbolTable. So we should just not
    include them at all, or not generate SCONST symbols at all. But
    at this late stage I'll just restore the old behavior.
