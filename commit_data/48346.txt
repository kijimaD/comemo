    go/build: include files with parse errors in GoFiles and other lists
    
    go/build.ImportDir returns a *build.Package with various lists of
    files. If a file is invalid for some reason, for example, because it
    has a different package name than other files, it's added to
    InvalidGoFiles in addition to GoFiles, TestGoFiles, or other lists.
    
    Previously, files with parse errors or build constraint errors were
    not included in these lists, which causes problems for tools that use
    'go list' since InvalidGoFiles is not printed. With this change, files
    with any kind of error are added to one of the GoFiles lists.
    
    Fixes #39986
