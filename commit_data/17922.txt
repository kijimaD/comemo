    runtime: remove cross-function jump in vlop_arm.s
    
    The new linker will disallow this on arm
    (it is already disallowed on amd64 and 386)
    in order to be able to lay out each function
    separately.
    
    The restriction is only for jumps into the middle
    of a function; jumps to the beginning of a function
    remain fine.
    
    Prereq for linker cleanup (golang.org/s/go13linker).
