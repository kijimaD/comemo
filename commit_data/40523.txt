    crypto/x509: fix value ownership in isSSLPolicy on macOS
    
    CFDictionaryGetValueIfPresent does not take ownership of the value, so
    releasing the properties dictionary before passing the value to CFEqual
    can crash. Not really clear why this works most of the time.
    
    See https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html
    
    Fixes #28092
    Hopefully fixes #30763
