    runtime: fix traceback on Windows
    
    The exception handler runs on the ordinary g stack,
    and the stack copier is now trying to do a traceback
    across it. That's never been needed before, so it was
    unimplemented. Implement it, in all its ugliness.
    
    Fixes windows/amd64 build.
