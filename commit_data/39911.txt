    runtime: always mask shift amount regardless of architecture
    
    Currently the shift amount is only masked on x86. Change it so it
    is masked on all architectures. In the worst case we generate a
    couple of extra instructions to perform the masking and in the best
    case we can elide overflow checks.
    
    This particular shift could also be replaced with a rotate
    instruction during optimization which would remove both the masking
    instructions and overflow checks on all architectures.
    
    Fixes #31165.
