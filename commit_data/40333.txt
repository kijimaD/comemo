    database/sql: remove forced log import from test
    
    This var _ = log.Printf line was added 8 years ago, in CL 4973055,
    which created the database/sql package and its tests. There was no
    goimports back then, so this was likely added to make it easier to
    use log package during development of tests.
    
    It's no longer needed, so remove it. It can always be conveniently
    re-added via goimports whenever needed.
