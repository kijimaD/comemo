    os: skip TestExecutableDeleted on plan9
    
    This test deletes the running executable file, which is not safe
    on Plan 9. The test was working by accident prior to commit 02ab8d1,
    which must have changed the page reference ordering just enough to
    cause a new demand page-in after deletion of the file.
    
    Fixes #45941
