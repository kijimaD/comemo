    runtime: don't use twice the memory with grsec-like kernels
    
    grsec needs the FIXED flag to be provided to mmap, which
    works now.  That said, when the allocation fails to be made
    in the specific address, we're still given back a writable
    page.  This change will unmap that page to avoid using
    twice the amount of memory needed.
    
    It'd also be pretty easy to avoid the extra system calls
    once we detected that the flag is needed, but I'm not sure
    if that edge case is worth the effort.
