    time: read 64-bit data if available
    
    Also store 64-bit data in lib/time/zoneinfo.zip.
    
    The comments argue that we don't need the 64-bit data until 2037 or
    2106, but that turns out not to be the case. We also need them for
    dates before December 13, 1901, which is time.Unix(-0x80000000, 0).
    
    Fixes #30099
