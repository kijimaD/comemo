    internal/poll: honor ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED if pipe is not closed
    
    FD.Read converts a syscall.ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED error to
    ErrFileClosing. It does that in case the pipe operation was aborted by
    a CancelIoEx call in FD.Close.
    
    It doesn't take into account that the operation might have been
    aborted by a CancelIoEx call in external code. In that case, the
    operation should return the error as is.
