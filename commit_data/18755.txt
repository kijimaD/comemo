commit 3f1374fcf8ae8b76679010d649a7b444772f9642
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    cmd/dist: use vfprintf on Windows, same as on Unix
    
    Apparently, the Windows routines sometimes fail to generate output.
    Copy the Unix stdio-based implementations instead.
    
    Suggested by Pietro Gagliardi in CL 65280043 but that CL
    seems to have been abandoned.
    
    Fixes #7242.
