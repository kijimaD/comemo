    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: do not schedule in-register args late, even for block control
    
    In the scheduler we have the logic that if a Value is used as the
    block's control, we schedule it at the end, except for Phis and
    Args. Even the comment says so, the code doesn't exclude
    in-register Args (OpArgXXXReg).
    
    Change to check for score instead, which includes OpArgXXXRegs.
    It also includes GetClosurePtr, which must be scheduled early.
    We just happen to never use it as block control.
    
    Found when working on ARM64 register ABI. In theory this could
    apply to AMD64 as well. But on AMD64 we never use in-register
    Value as block control, as conditional branch is always based on
    FLAGS, never based on registers, so it doesn't actually cause any
    problem.
