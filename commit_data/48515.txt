    cmd/gofmt: return a proper error for empty Go files
    
    I was testing edge cases in gofumpt, a fork of gofmt,
    and noticed that gofmt will return a bare io error on empty files,
    as demonstrated by the added test case without a fix:
    
            > ! exec $GOROOT/bin/gofmt empty.go nopackage.go
            [stderr]
            EOF
            nopackage.go:1:1: expected 'package', found not
    
    The problem is the code that detects concurrent modifications.
    It relies on ReadFull and correctly deals with io.ErrUnexpectedEOF,
    but it did not pay attention to io.EOF, which can happen when size==0.
