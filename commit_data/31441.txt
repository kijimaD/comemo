    cmd/vet/all: work around vet printf checker deficiencies
    
    cmd/vet has a known deficiency in its handling of fmt.Formatters.
    This causes a spurious printf error only for non-host platforms.
    Since cmd/vet/all may get run on any given platform,
    whitelists cannot help here.
    
    Work around the issue by skipping printf tests entirely
    for non-host platforms.
    
    Work around the one known acceptable false positive from vet
    by whitelisting the file that contains it.
