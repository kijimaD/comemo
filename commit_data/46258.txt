    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: cleanup for concrete types - noder
    
    An automated rewrite will add concrete type assertions after
    a test of n.Op(), when n can be safely type-asserted
    (meaning, n is not reassigned a different type, n is not reassigned
    and then used outside the scope of the type assertion,
    and so on).
    
    This sequence of CLs handles the code that the automated
    rewrite does not: adding specific types to function arguments,
    adjusting code not to call n.Left() etc when n may have multiple
    representations, and so on.
    
    This CL focuses on noder.go.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
