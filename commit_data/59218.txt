    make.bat: fix GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP detection
    
    Due to a flaw in the %GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP% detection logic, the last Go
    executable found by `where go` was taking precedence over the first one.
    
    In batch scripts, environment variable expansion happens when each line
    of the script is read, not when it is executed. Thus, the check in the
    loop for GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP being unset would always be true, even when
    the variable had been set in a previous loop iteration.
    
    See SET /? for more information.
