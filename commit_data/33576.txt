    cmd/link: set correct alignment of ELF note section
    
    Otherwise the default computation in symalign kicked in, setting the
    alignment to be too high. This didn't matter with GNU ld, which put
    each loadable note into a separate PT_NOTE segment, but it did matter
    with gold which accumulated them all into a single PT_NOTE segment,
    respecting the requested alignment. In the single PT_NOTE segment
    generated by gold, the incorrect section alignment made the notes
    unreadable.
    
    Fixes #21564
