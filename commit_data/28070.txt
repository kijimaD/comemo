    [dev.garbage] runtime: cleanup and optimize span.base()
    
    Prior to this CL the base of a span was calculated in various
    places using shifts or calls to base(). This CL now
    always calls base() which has been optimized to calculate the
    base of the span when the span is initialized and store that
    value in the span structure.
