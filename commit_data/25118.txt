    tests/fixedbugs: make test for issue11656 run known instruction
    
    As detailed in #11910, the current implementation attempts to execute an area
    of memory with unknown content. If the memory is executable, the result is
    unpredictable - instead, make the test deterministic by attempting to execute
    an instruction that is known to trigger a trap on the given architecture.
    
    The new implementation is written by iant@ and provided via #11910.
    
    Update issue #11910
