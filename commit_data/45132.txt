   The <code>go</code> <code>get</code> <code>-insecure</code> flag is
-  deprecated and will be removed in a future version. The <code>GOINSECURE</code>
-  environment variable should be used instead, since it provides control
-  over which modules may be retrieved using an insecure scheme. Unlike the
-  <code>-insecure</code> flag, <code>GOINSECURE</code> does not disable module
-  sum validation using the checksum database. The <code>GOPRIVATE</code> or
-  <code>GONOSUMDB</code> environment variables may be used instead.
