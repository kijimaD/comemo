    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: don't panic if types change
    
    There was a bug where if the types to fuzz were
    different from the types in a file in the on-disk
    corpus, then the code would panic. We thought
    this case was handled, but the final `continue`
    in the nested loop still allowed the invalid
    entry to be added to the corpus. Pulling the
    validation into a helper function makes this
    less brittle.
