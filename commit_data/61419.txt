    cmd/internal/objabi, cmd/link: add FIPS symbol kinds
    
    Add FIPS symbol kinds that will be needed for FIPS support.
    This is a separate CL to keep the re-generated changes in
    the string methods separate from hand-written changes.
    
    The separate symbol kinds will let us group the FIPS-related
    code and data together, so that it can be checksummed at
    startup, as required by FIPS.
    
    It's also separate because it breaks buildall, by changing the
    on-disk symbol kind enumeration. We want non-buildall
    changes to be as simple as possible.
    
    For #69536.
