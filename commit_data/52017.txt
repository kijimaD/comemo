    cmd/link: don't switch to gold on ARM Linux
    
    The bug in GNU ld appears to have been fixed in GNU binutils 2.28 by
    GNU binutils revision 5522f910cb539905d6adfdceab208ddfa5e84557.
    (This may have been accidental as the ChangeLog for the fix makes
    no reference to it; the fix is from
    https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19962).
    
    Continue using gold on arm64, at least for now, because as reported in
    issue #22040 GNU ld still fails there.
    
    For #15696
    For #22040
