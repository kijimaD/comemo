    cmd/compile: fix ICE with recursive alias type parameter
    
    CL 585399 fixed an initialization loop during IR contruction that
    involving alias type, by avoiding publishing alias declarations until
    the RHS type expression has been constructed.
    
    There's an assertion to ensure that the alias's type must be the same
    during the initialization. However, that assertion is too strict, since
    we may construct different instances of the same type, if the type is an
    instantination of generic type.
    
    To fix this, we could use types.IdenticalStrict to ensure that these
    types matching exactly.
    
    Updates #66873.
    Updates #73309.
