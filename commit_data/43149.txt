    [dev.link] cmd/link: demote dwarf {range,loc} sub-symbols to aux
    
    When the compiler emits DWARF for a function F, in addition to the
    text symbol for F, it emits a set of sibling or child symbols that
    carry the various DWARF bits for F (for example, go.info.F,
    go.ranges.F, go.loc.F, and so on).
    
    Prior to the linker modernization work, name lookup was the way you
    made your way from a function symbol to one of its child DWARF
    symbols. We now have a new mechanism (aux symbols), so there is really
    no need for the DWARF sub-symbols to be named or to be dupok.
    
    This patch converts DWARF "range" and "loc" sub-symbols to be pure aux
    syms: unnamed, and connected to their parent text symbol only via aux
    data. This should presumably have performance benefits in that we add
    fewer symbols to the linker lookup tables.
    
    Other related DWARF sub-symbols (ex: go.line.*) will be handled in a
    subsequent patch.
