commit 458e23e151aa00e1c2a8529681e5656f0b8cc2ed

    Implement type compatibility and fix places where I thought
    types were supposed to be identical but only needed to be
    compatible.  This gets rid of the Type.literal method.  I
    renamed the Type.rep method to Type.lit because I believe it
    corresponds to the term "literal" as used in the spec.
