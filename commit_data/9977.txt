    goyacc: make more gofmt-compliant
    
    Adjust goyacc.go to produce code that is gofmt-compliant whenever it is easy to do so. Also changed two lines in cpyact that appeared to be bugs.
    
    Also updated units.y to remove a few other errors.
    
    After this change, units.go has only two style errors: an extra newline at the top of the file, and yys misaligned in yySymType.
