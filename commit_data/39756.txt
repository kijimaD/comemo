    ld: ensure that PE versions sync for internal and external linkage
    
    Previously users who opted into cgo might have received a bit of a
    behavior surprise when their mingw installation defaulted to a
    potentially older and different set of compatibility hacks. Since Go is
    explicitly targeting >=6.1 for internal linkage, propagate these changes
    to external linkage too.
    
    While we're at it, we move these values into constant variables so that
    they don't become out of sync and allow for easy updating as Go
    gradually drops compatibility for older operating systems.
