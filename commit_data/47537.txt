    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of example_test.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/example_test.go
    and example_test.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker.
    
    The primary differences to go/types/example_test.go are:
    - use of syntax instead of go/ast package
    - no ExampleMethodSet test (types2 doesn't have MethodSet)
    - some code in ExampleInfo is disabled due to less precise
      position information provided by the syntax tree
