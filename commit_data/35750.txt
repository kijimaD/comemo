    cmd/compile: fix exporting of 'for' loops
    
    The existing code for encoding 'for' loops in exported, inlineable
    functions incorrectly assumed that the 'Right' field points to an
    'expression' node. Adjusted the code to be able to handle any kind
    of node. Made matching changes for the binary and indexed exporter.
    
    This only shows up together with other pending compiler changes that
    enable exporting of such functions which contain for loops.
    
    No tests yet because we can't test this w/o those pending compiler
    changes. Once those changes are in, this code will be tested implicitly.
    However, the changes were tested manually together with the patches
    described in the issue.
    
    Fixes #25222.
