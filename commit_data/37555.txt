    cmd/go: report which patterns match each package in list
    
    It's important for some uses of go/packages, as well as for some
    of go/packages's internal use, to be able to tell which results from
    go list output correspond to which patterns, keeping in mind that
    a single package might have been matched by multiple patterns.
    
    Also adds test for #26925.
