    cmd/compile: decrease inlining call cost from 60 to 57
    
    A Go user made a well-documented request for a slightly
    lower threshold.  I tested against a selection of other
    people's benchmarks, and saw a tiny benefit (possibly noise)
    at equally tiny cost, and no unpleasant surprises observed
    in benchmarking.
    
    I.e., might help, doesn't hurt, low risk, request was
    delivered on a silver platter.
    
    It did, however, change the behavior of one test because
    now bytes.Buffer.Grow is eligible for inlining.
    
    Updates #19348.
