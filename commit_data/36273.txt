 Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
-For example, Go 1.8 is supported until Go 1.10 is released,
-and Go 1.9 is supported until Go 1.11 is released.
+For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was
+supported until the Go 1.8 release.
 We fix critical problems, including <a href="/security">critical security problems</a>,
 in supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions
-(for example, Go 1.9.1, Go 1.9.2, and so on).
