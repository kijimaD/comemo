    runtime: increase g0 stack size in non-cgo case
    
    Currently, for non-cgo programs, the g0 stack size is 8 KiB on
    most platforms. With PGO which could cause aggressive inlining in
    the runtime, the runtime stack frames are larger and could
    overflow the 8 KiB g0 stack. Increase it to 16 KiB. This is only
    one per OS thread, so it shouldn't increase memory use much.
    
    Fixes #62120.
    Fixes #62489.
