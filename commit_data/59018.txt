    cmd/go: fix build config before creating actions for 'go list -cover'
    
    When -covermode is set to atomic, instrumented packages need to import
    sync/atomic. If this is not already imported by a package being
    instrumented, the build needs to ensure that sync/atomic is compiled
    whenever 'go list' is run in a way that triggers package builds.
    
    The build config was already being made to ensure the import, but only
    after the action graph had been created, so there was no guarantee that
    sync/atomic would be built when needed.
    
    Fixes #65264.
