    math/rand: warn against using package for security-sensitive work
    
    Urge users of math/rand to consider using crypto/rand when doing
    security-sensitive work.
    
    Related to issue #11871. While we haven't reached consensus on how
    to make the package inherently safer, everyone agrees that the docs
    for math/rand can be improved.
