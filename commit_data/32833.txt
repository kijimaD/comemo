    builtin: use type aliases for rune and byte
    
    As motivated by https://golang.org/design/18130-type-alias which says:
    
    https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/18130-type-alias.md#relationship-to-byte-and-rune
    
    > The language specification already defines byte as an alias for
    > uint8 and similarly rune as an alias for int32, using the word alias
    > as an informal term. It is a goal that the new type declaration
    > semantics not introduce a different meaning for alias. That is, it
    > should be possible to describe the existing meanings of byte and
    > uint8 by saying that they behave as if predefined by:
    >
    >     type byte = uint8
    >     type rune = int32
    
    So, do that. Seems to work.
