    runtime: fix stack-move sensitivity in some tests
    
    There are a few tests of the scheduler run queue API that allocate a
    local []g and test using those G's. However, the run queue API
    frequently converts between *g and guintptr, which is safe for "real"
    Gs because they're heap-allocated and hence don't move, but if these
    tests get a stack movement while holding one of these local *g's as a
    guintptr, it won't get updated and the test will fail.
    
    Updates #48297.
