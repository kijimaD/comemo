    runtime: poison pcln.frame value
    
    Nothing uses it, nothing should start using it.
    Stop leaving plausible-looking values there.
    It would be nice to remove entirely, but that would
    require a new version number for the object file format,
    in order not to break external readers like debug/gosym.
    It's easier to leave and poison.
    
    I came across an old mail thread suggesting we start using it
    to speed up tracebacks. I want to make sure that doesn't happen.
    
    (The values there were never quite right, and the number is
    fundamentally PC-specific anyway.)
