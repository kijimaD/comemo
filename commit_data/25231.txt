    cmd/link: remove -W option
    
    The -W option has not worked since Go 1.3.  It is not documented.  When
    it did work, it generated useful output, but it was for human viewing;
    there was no reason to write a script that passes the -W option, so it's
    unlikely that anybody is using it today.
