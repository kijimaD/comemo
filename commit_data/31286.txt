    net/rpc: fix aliasing in TestAcceptExitAfterListenerClose
    
    TestRPC writes to newServer and newServerAddr guarded with a
    sync.Once.
    TestAcceptExitAfterListenerClose was overwriting those variables,
    which caused the second invocation of TestRPC within a single process
    to fail.
    
    A second invocation can occur as a result of running the test with
    multiple values for the -cpu flag.
    
    fixes #19001.
