    asm: give error message for unadorned symbol reference
    
    On amd64, the program
    
    TEXT    foo0(SB),7,$-8
        ADDQ R520, R1
        RET
    
    used to trigger this error because R520 was being passed through to obj:
    
    asm: doasm: notfound ft=23 tt=23 00000 (x.s:2)  ADDQ    0, 0 23 23
    
    Now it gets this one, as it is indeed a parse error:
    
    x.s:2: illegal addressing mode for symbol R520
    
    This couldn't be fixed until #12632 had been fixed for arm64.
    
    Fixes #12470.
