    runtime: don't try to shrink address space with brk in Plan 9
    
    Plan 9 won't let brk shrink the data segment if it's shared with
    other processes (which it is in the go runtime).  So we keep track
    of the notional end of the segment as it moves up and down, and
    call brk only when it grows.
    
    Corrects CL 94776.
    
    Updates #23860.
    Fixes #24013.
