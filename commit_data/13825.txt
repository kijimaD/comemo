commit a4d08ed5dfe23f5b0d777548410456fbb517478c
Author: Marcel van Lohuizen <mpvl@golang.org>

    exp/locale/collate: changed API to allow access to different locales through New(),
    instead of variables. Several reasons:
    - Encourage users of the API to minimize the number of creations and reuse Collate objects.
    - Don't rule out the possibility of using initialization code for collators. For some locales
      it will be possible to have very compact representations that can be quickly expanded
      into a proper table on demand.
    Other changes:
    - Change name of root* vars to main*, as the tables are shared between locales.
    - Added Locales() method to get a list of supported locales.
