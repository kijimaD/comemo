    6l: eliminate dead code, not just the symbols
    
    editing the firstp list was ineffective,
    because follow rebuilds it from the textp list.
    
    the symbols for dead code were being dropped
    from the binary but the code was all still there.
    
    text for fmt.Printf("hello, world\n") drops
    from 143945 to 128650.
