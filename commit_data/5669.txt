    http: reply to Expect 100-continue requests automatically
    
    This CL replaces my earlier https://golang.org/cl/1640044/show
    in which Continue handling was explicit.  Instead, this CL makes
    it automatic.  Reading from Body() is an implicit acknowledgement
    that the request headers were fine and the body is wanted.  In that
    case, the 100 Continue response is written automatically when the
    request continues the "Expect: 100-continue" header.
