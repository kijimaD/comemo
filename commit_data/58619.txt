    cmd/trace: common up the mmu page and add it to cmd/trace/v2
    
    This change moves the MMU HTTP handlers and functionality into the
    traceviewer package, since unlike the goroutine pages the vast majority
    of that functionality is identical between v1 and v2. This change
    involves some refactoring so that callers can plug in their own mutator
    utilization computation functions (which is the only point of difference
    between v1 and v2). The new interface isn't especially nice, but part of
    the problem is the MMU handlers depend on specific endpoints to exist. A
    follow-up CL will clean this up a bit.
    
    Like the previous CL did for goroutine analysis, modify the v2 mutator
    utilization API to accept a slice of trace events. Again, we might as
    well reuse what was already parsed and will be needed for other
    purposes. It also simplifies the API slightly.
    
    For #60773.
    For #63960.
