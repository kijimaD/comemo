    cmd/dist: make textflag.h available in runtime, avoid android/linux conflicts
    
    1) cmd/dist was copying textflag.h to the build include directory,
    but only after compiling package runtime. So other packages could
    use it, just not runtime. Copy earlier, so that runtime can use it too.
    
    2) We decided for android that anything marked linux is also included
    in the build. The generated linux-specific files in cmd/dist must therefore
    have explicit +build !android tags, or else you can't have simultaneous
    linux/arm and android/arm builds in a single client. The tag was already
    there for at least one file, but it was missing from many others.
