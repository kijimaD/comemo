    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: simplify export data representation of nil
    
    The handling of ONIL and Orig has been a mess for a while, and dates
    back to how fmt.go used to print out typed nils. That hasn't applied
    for a while, but we've kept dragging it along to appease toolstash
    with the intention of someday finally removing it.
    
    Today is that day.
