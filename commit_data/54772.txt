    runtime: allow for 10 more threads in TestWindowsStackMemory*
    
    CL 473415 allowed 5 more threads in TestWindowsStackMemory, to cover
    sysmon and any new threads in future. However, during go1.22 dev cycle,
    the test becomes flaky again, failing in windows-386 builder a couple of
    times in CL 535975 and CL 536175 (and maybe others that haven't caught).
    
    This CL increases the extra threads from 5 to 10, hopefully to make the
    test stable again for windows-386. The theory is that Go process load a
    bunch of DLLs, which may start their own threads. We could investigate
    more deeply if the test still be flaky with 10 extra threads.
    
    Fixes #58570
