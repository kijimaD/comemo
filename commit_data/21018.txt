    cmd/ld: set ELF ABI version for ppc64x
    
    On ppc64, there are three ELF ABI versions an ELF file can request.
    Previously, we used 0, which means "unspecified".  On our test
    machines, this meant to use the default (v1 for big endian and v2 for
    little endian), but apparently some systems can pick the wrong ABI if
    neither is requested.  Leaving this as 0 also confuses libbfd, which
    confuses gdb, objdump, etc.
    
    Fix these problems by specifying ABI v1 for big endian and v2 for
    little endian.
