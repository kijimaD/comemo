    os: fix type check error in benchmark
    
    Previously, 's' was only written to, never read,
    which is disallowed by the spec. cmd/compile
    has a bug where it doesn't notice this when a
    closure is involved, but go/types does notice,
    which was making "go vet" fail.
    
    This CL moves the variable into the closure
    and also makes sure to use it.
