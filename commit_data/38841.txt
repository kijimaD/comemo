    runtime: fix heap pointer invariant rules in HACKING.md
    
    This change fixes an error in HACKING.md which claims all pointers
    which live in unmanaged memory but point to the heap must be marked
    as GC roots explicitly by runtime.markroot. This isn't technically
    necessary if the pointer is accessible through a global variable.
