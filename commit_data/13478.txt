+What is the status of the project?</h3>
+
+<p>
+Go became a public open source project on November 10, 2009.
+After a couple of years of very active design and development, stability was called for and
+Go 1 was <a href="http://blog.golang.org/2012/03/go-version-1-is-released.html">released</a>
+on March 28, 2012.
+Go 1, which includes a <a href="/ref/spec">language specification</a>,
+<a href="/pkg/">standard libraries</a>,
+and <a href="/cmd/go/">custom tools</a>,
+provides a stable foundation for creating reliable products, projects, and publications.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+With that stability established, we are using Go to develop programs, products, and tools rather than
+actively changing the language and libraries.
+In fact, the purpose of Go 1 is to provide <a href="/doc/go1compat.html">long-term stability</a>.
+Backwards-incompatible changes will not be made to any Go 1 point release.
+We want to use what we have to learn how a future version of Go might look, rather than to play with
+the language underfoot.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Of course, development will continue on Go itself, but the focus will be on performance, reliability,
+portability and the addition of new functionality such as improved support for internationalization.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+There may well be a Go 2 one day, but not for a few years and it will be influenced by what we learn using Go 1 as it is today.
