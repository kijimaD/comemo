+<pre>
+This release includes changes to the net package. Your code will require
+changes if it uses the Dial or LookupHost functions.
+
+The laddr argument has been removed from net.Dial, and the cname return value
+has been removed from net.LookupHost. The new net.LookupCNAME function can be
+used  to find the canonical host for a given name.  You can update your
+networking code with gofix.
+
+The gotest shell script has been replaced by a Go program, making testing
+significantly faster.
