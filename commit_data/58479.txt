    runtime: remove work.pauseStart
    
    Most of the uses of work.pauseStart are completely useless, it could
    simply be a local variable. One use passes a parameter from gcMarkDone
    to gcMarkTermination, but that could simply be an argument.
    
    Keeping this field in workType makes it seems more important than it
    really is, so just drop it.
