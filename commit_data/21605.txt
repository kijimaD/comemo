    [dev.cc] cmd/dist: bootstrap Go toolchain using Go 1.4
    
    Bootstrap the Go parts of the Go toolchain using Go 1.4,
    as described in https://golang.org/s/go15bootstrap.
    
    The first Go part of the Go toolchain will be cmd/objwriter,
    but for now that's just an empty program to test that this
    new code works.
    
    Once the build dashboard is okay with this change,
    we'll make objwriter a real program depended upon by the build.
