    misc/ios: serialize iOS execution
    
    The iOS exec wrapper use complicated machinery to run a iOS binary
    on a device.
    Running several binaries concurrently doesn't work (reliably), which
    can break tests running concurrently. For my setup, the
    runtime:cpu124 and sync_cpu tests can't run reliably without one of them
    crashing.
    
    Add a file lock to the exec wrapper to serialize execution.
    
    Fixes #14318 (for me)
