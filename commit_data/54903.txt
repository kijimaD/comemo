    cmd/link: add capturehostobjs debugging flag
    
    Add a new debugging flag "-capturehostobjs" that instructs the linker
    to capture copies of all object files loaded in during the host object
    loading portion of CGO internal linking. The intent is to make it
    easier to analyze the objects after the fact (as opposed to having to
    dig around inside archives, which can be a "find needle in haystack"
    exercise).
