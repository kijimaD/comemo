    net/http/cgi: eliminate use of Perl in tests
    
    Previously, a Perl script was used to test the net/http/cgi package.
    This sometimes led to hidden failures as these tests were not run
    on builders without Perl.
    Also, this approach posed maintenance difficulties for those
    unfamiliar with Perl.
    
    We have now replaced Perl-based tests with a Go handler to simplify
    maintenance and ensure consistent testing environments.
    It's part of our ongoing effort to reduce reliance on Perl throughout
    the Go codebase (see #20032,#25586,#25669,#27779),
    thus improving reliability and ease of maintenance.
    
    Fixes #63800
    Fixes #63828
