    runtime: allow builtin write function to be redirected with function pointer
    
    The x/sys/windows package currently uses go:linkname for other facilities
    inside of runtime that are not suitable to be exposed as a public API
    due to their dangers but are still necessary for manipulating any
    low-level plumbing that the runtime controls.
    
    Logging, via the built-in println and panic handler, is one such
    low-level plumbing feature. In this case, x/sys/windows/svc needs to be
    able to redirect panics to the Windows event log. Because the event log
    is a complicated interface, this requires a bit more fiddling than the
    simple solution used on Android (baking it into runtime itself), and
    because Windows services are very diverse, the event log might not even
    always be a desirable destination.
    
    This commit accomplishes this by exposing a function pointer called
    "overrideWrite" that low-level runtime packages like x/sys/windows/svc
    can use to redirect output logs toward the event log or otherwise.
    
    It is not safe or acceptable to use as a generic mechanism, and for that
    reason, we wouldn't want to expose this as a real stable API, similar to
    the other instances of go:linkname in x/sys/windows. But for packages
    that must interoperate with low-level Go runtime fundamentals, this is a
    safety hatch for packages that are developed in tandem with the runtime.
    x/sys/windows is one such package.
    
    Updates #42888.
