    cmd/link/internal/ld: more fixes to TestElfBindNow readonly .got check
    
    Second try at fixing the TestElfBindNow testpoint: don't try to check
    for readonly ".got" section when using the external linker, since
    there is code in some linkers (BFD in particular) that will skip
    placing ".got" in relro if the section is below a specific size
    threshold. Revised version of the test checks only for readonly
    ".dynamic" in the external linking case.
    
    Fixes #67063.
