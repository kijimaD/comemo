    cmd/compile/internal/noder: suppress unionType consistency check
    
    In the types1 universe, we only need to represent value types. For
    interfaces, this means we only need to worry about pure interfaces. A
    pure interface can embed a union type, but the overall union must be
    equivalent to "any".
    
    In go.dev/cl/458619, we changed the types1 reader to return "any", but
    to incorporate a consistency check to make sure this is valid.
    Unfortunately, a pure interface can actually still reference impure
    interfaces, and in general this is hard to check precisely without
    reimplementing a lot of types2 data structures and logic into types1.
    
    We haven't had any other reports of this check failing since 1.20, so
    it seems simplest to just suppress for now.
    
    Fixes #60117.
