    spec: consistently use "defined type" and "type name" (cleanup)
    
    When we introduced the notion of alias type declarations, we renamed
    "named type" to "defined type" to avoid confusion with types denoted
    by aliases and thus are also types with names, or "named types".
    
    Some of the old uses of "named types" remained; this change removes
    them.
    
    Now the spec consistently uses the terms:
    
    - "defined type"  for a type declared via a type definition
    - "type name"     for any name denoting an (alias or defined) type
    - "alias"         for a type name declared in an alias declaration
    
    New prose is encouraged to avoid the term "named type" to counter-
    act further confusion.
    
    Fixes #23474.
