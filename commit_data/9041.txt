    5l, 6l, 8l: Add a PT_LOAD PHDR entry for the PHDR.
    
    Per the TIS ELF spec, if a PHDR entry is present in the
    program header table, it must be part of the memory image of
    the program. Failure to do this makes elflint complain, and
    causes some tools that manipulate ELF to crash.
