    cmd/compile: delete gdata
    
    All callers to gdata knew the kind of node they were working with,
    so all calls to gdata have been replaced with more specific calls.
    
    Some OADDR nodes were constructed solely for the purpose of
    passing them to gdata for unwrapping. In those cases, we can now
    cut to the chase.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
