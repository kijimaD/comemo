    cmd/doc: put blank lines around comment for types, etc.
    
    Better layout.
    
    Fixes #10859.
    
    The issue suggests rearranging so the comment comes out
    after the methods. I tried this and it looks good but it is less
    useful, since the stuff you're probably looking for - the methods
    - are scrolled away by the comment. The most important
    information should be last because that leaves it on your
    screen after the print if the output is long.
