    runtime: correct runtime.GOOS, runtime.GOARCH
    
    If the same directory was used for multiple builds,
    it was possible for a stale version.go to contain the
    wrong definitions for $GOOS and $GOARCH, because
    they can change even if the hg version does not.
    Split into multiple files to fix.
