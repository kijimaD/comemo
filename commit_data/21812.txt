    cmd/5a: prepare reglist correctly
    
    This was working when 5a was built on x86 because REG_R0 = 32,
    and a 32-bit shift on x86 uses only the low 32 bits of the shift count.
    
    On ARM, the shift clamping is different.
    
    Moving to Go will avoid these differing shift semantics.
    I tripped over and fixed this bug in new5a the same way earlier tonight.
