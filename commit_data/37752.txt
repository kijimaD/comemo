    runtime: use QPC for nanotime and time.now on windows/arm
    
    The previous implementation of nanotime and time.now used a time source
    that was updated on the system clock tick, which has a maximum
    resolution of about 1ms. On 386 and amd64, this time source maps to
    the system performance counter, so has much higher resolution.
    On ARM, use QueryPerformanceCounter() to get a high resolution timestamp.
    
    Updates #26148
