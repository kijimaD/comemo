    runtime/gdb: use goroutine atomicstatus to determine the state
    
    Previously find_goroutine determined whether a goroutine is
    stopped by checking the sched.sp field. This heuristic doesn't
    always hold but causes find_goroutine to return bogus pc/sp
    info for running goroutines.
    
    This change uses the atomicstatus bit to determine
    the state which is more accurate.
