    runtime: save/restore callee-saved registers in loong64's sigtramp
    
    Loong64's R22-R31 and F24-F31 are callee saved registers, which
    should be saved in the beginning of sigtramp, and restored at
    the end.
    
    In reviewing comments about sigtramp in sys_linux_arm64 it was
    noted that a previous issue in arm64 due to missing callee save
    registers could also be a problem on loong64, so code was added
    to save and restore those.
