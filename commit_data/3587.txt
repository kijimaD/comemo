    - method names in method sets/interfaces must be all different
    - specify evaluation order of floating-point expressions as
      discussed
    - specify floating point conversion rounding as discussed
    - slightly reformatted section on conversions to make it
      more readable (hopefully)
    - fixed production for interpreted_string_lit - components
      were not properly tagged before because of """ instead of `"`
