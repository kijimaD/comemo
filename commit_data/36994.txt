    encoding/json: always verify we can get a field's value
    
    Calling .Interface on a struct field's reflect.Value isn't always safe.
    For example, if that field is an unexported anonymous struct.
    
    We only descended into this branch if the struct type had any methods,
    so this bug had gone unnoticed for a few release cycles.
    
    Add the check, and add a simple test case.
    
    Fixes #28145.
