    doc/asm: add a section on go_asm.h, clean up go_tls.h section
    
    Currently the only mention of go_asm.h is buried in a confusing
    section about the runtime-specific go_tls.h header. We actually want
    people to use go_asm.h, so this CL adds a section with a proper
    discussion of this header. As part of this, we remove the discussion
    of go_asm.h from the go_tls.h section and clean up what remains.
    
    I stumbled on this when working on the internal ABI specification. I
    wanted to refer to stable documentation on how to access struct fields
    from assembly and found there was none.
