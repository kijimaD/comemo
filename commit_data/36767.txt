    net: concatenate multiple TXT strings in single TXT record
    
    When go resolver was changed to use dnsmessage.Parser, LookupTXT
    returned two strings in one record as two different records. This change
    reverts back to concatenating multiple strings in a single
    TXT record.
    
    Fixes #27763
