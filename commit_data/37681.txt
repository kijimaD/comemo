    encoding/json: simplify the structEncoder type
    
    structEncoder had two slices - the list of fields, and a list containing
    the encoder for each field. structEncoder.encode then looped over the
    fields, and indexed into the second slice to grab the field encoder.
    
    However, this makes it very hard for the compiler to be able to prove
    that the two slices always have the same length, and that the index
    expression doesn't need a bounds check.
    
    Merge the two slices into one to completely remove the need for bounds
    checks in the hot loop.
    
    While at it, don't copy the field elements when ranging, which greatly
    speeds up the hot loop in structEncoder.
