    cmd/6l: use .plt instead of .got on Solaris
    
    Solaris requires all external procedures to be accessed through the
    PLT. If 6l won't do it, /bin/ld will, so all the code written with .GOT
    in mind won't work with the external linker.
    
    This CL makes external linking work, opening the path to cgo support
    on Solaris.
    
    This CL breaks the Solaris build, this is fixed in subsequent CLs in
    this series.
