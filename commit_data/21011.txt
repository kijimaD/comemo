    os/exec: tell lsof not to block
    
    For some reason lsof is now hanging on my workstation
    without the -b (avoid blocking in the kernel) option.
    Adding -b makes the test pass and shouldn't hurt.
    
    I don't know how recent the -b option is.  If the builders
    are ok with it, it's probably ok.
