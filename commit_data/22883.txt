    runtime: remove runtime wait/notify from ppc64x architectures.
    
    Related to issue #10410
    
    For some reason, any non-trivial code in _cgo_wait_runtime_init_done
    (even fprintf()) will crash that call.
    
    If anybody has any guess why this is happening, please let me know!
    
    For now, I'm clearing the functions for ppc64, as it's currently not used.
