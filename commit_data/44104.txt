    testing: tests and benchmarks can assume flag.Parsed
    
    testing.M.Run has this bit of code:
    
            if !flag.Parsed() {
                    flag.Parse()
            }
    
    It makes sense, and it's common knowledge for many Go developers that
    test flags are automatically parsed by the time tests and benchmarks are
    run. However, the docs didn't clarify that. The previous wording only
    mentioned that flag.Parse isn't run before TestMain, which doesn't
    necessarily mean that it's run afterwards.
    
    Fixes #38952.
