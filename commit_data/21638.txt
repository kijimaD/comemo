    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: add lex internal package
    
    Add the lexing code for the new portable assembler.
    It is internal to the assembler, so lives in a subdirectory of cmd/asm/internal.
    
    Its only new dependency is the flags package for the assembler, so
    add that too; it's trivial. That package manages the command-line
    flags in a central place.
    
    The lexer builds on text/scanner to lex the input, including doing a
    Plan 9-level implementation of the C preprocessor.
