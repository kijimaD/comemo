    net/http: regenerate http2 bundle with bundle fixes to include comments
    
    The golang.org/x/tools/cmd/bundle tool previously had a bug where it
    dropped some comments.
    
    This regenerates it with the fixed version (https://golang.org/cl/45117).
    
    (Upstream is still git rev 3470a06c1, from https://golang.org/cl/44331)
    
    Updates #20548
