    net/http: disable recently-introduced flaky test on Windows
    
    Disable it until it's debugged so it doesn't hide other real
    problems on Windows. The test was known to be unreliable
    anyway (which is why it only needed 1 of 20 runs to pass), but
    apparently it never passes on Windows. Figure out why later.
    
    Update #7634
