    cmd/link: add -buildid flag to write Go build ID to ELF output, same as cmd/compile
    
    Other binary formats to follow.
    
    Using our own note instead of the GNU build ID note because
    we are not the GNU project, and I can't guarantee that the semantics
    of our note and the semantics of the GNU note will match forever.
    (Also they don't match today.)
    
    For #11048.
