    runtime/pprof/internal: delete package gzip0
    
    rsc's change golang.org/cl/32455 added a mechanism
    that allows pprof to depend on gzip without introducing
    an import cycle. This obsoletes the need for the gzip0
    package, which was created solely to remove the need
    for that dependency.
