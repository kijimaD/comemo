    runtime: fix openbsd build
    notetsleep: nosplit stack overflow
            120     assumed on entry to notetsleep
            96      after notetsleep uses 24
            88      on entry to runtime.semasleep
            32      after runtime.semasleep uses 56
            24      on entry to runtime.nanotime
            -8      after runtime.nanotime uses 32
    
    Nanotime seems to be using only 24 bytes of stack space.
    Unless I am missing something.
