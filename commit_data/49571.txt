    cmd/go: add a 'sleep' command for script tests
    
    Due to mtime skew we don't index mutable packages with an mtime
    younger than 2 seconds. In order to test indexed packages reliably, we
    want to be able to sleep long enough for the files in the package to be cached.
    
    (As an alternative we could instead use os.Chtimes to fake old enough
    timestamps, but sleeping keeps the tests more realistic.)
    
    For #53586.
