    internal/fuzz: log average execs/sec since last log
    
    This change also fixes a bug with calculating the
    total interesting count. When fuzzing with an empty
    corpus, the fuzzing engine adds an starting corpus
    value in that run in order to start fuzzing. That
    meant that the interesting total count was off by one:
    it would start at 1, even though the cache was empty.
    Added some tests for this as well.
    
    Fixes #48787
