    cmd/go: in TestScript, set $GOEXE instead of $exe
    
    $GOEXE exists and is documented in 'go env', so $exe is redundant and
    a bit confusing. Notably, mod_modinfo.txt already assumes that GOEXE
    is set (even though it isn't), and thus fails on Windows.
    
    After this CL, `go test cmd/go/...` passes on a windows-amd64-2016
    builder. However, given that the $PATH on the builder is very minimal
    (#32430) and network access is limited, tests that rely on binaries
    (such as 'git') or external networking may still be broken.
    
    Updates #25300
