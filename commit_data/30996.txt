    net/http: preserve original HTTP method when possible
    
    In Go1.7, a 301, 302, or 303 redirect on a HEAD method, would still
    cause the following redirects to still use a HEAD.
    In CL/29852 this behavior was changed such that those codes always
    caused a redirect with the GET method. Fix this such that both
    GET and HEAD will preserve the method.
    
    Fixes #18570
