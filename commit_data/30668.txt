    cmd/compile: define roles for ssa.Func, ssa.Config, and ssa.Cache
    
    The line between ssa.Func and ssa.Config has blurred.
    Concurrent compilation in the backend will require more precision.
    This CL lays out an (aspirational) organization.
    The implementation will come in follow-up CLs,
    once the organization is settled.
    
    ssa.Config holds basic compiler configuration,
    mostly arch-specific information.
    It is configured once, early on, and is readonly,
    so it is safe for concurrent use.
    
    ssa.Func is a single-shot object used for
    compiling a single Func. It is not concurrency-safe
    and not re-usable.
    
    ssa.Cache is a multi-use object used to avoid
    expensive allocations during compilation.
    Each ssa.Func is given an ssa.Cache to use.
    ssa.Cache is not concurrency-safe.
