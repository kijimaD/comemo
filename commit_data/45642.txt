    cmd/link: use internal linking for -race mode on darwin/arm64
    
    The code I wrote in ldmacho.go in CL 266373 was plainly wrong. It
    didn't carry rAdd over correctly. Fixed. Also added sign extension
    (as ld64 does).
    
    Internal linking with -race mode now works. Enable it.
    
    Updates #38485.
