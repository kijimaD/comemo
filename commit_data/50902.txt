    cmd/dist: drop support for pre-compiled test binaries
    
    We haven't used this in a while and it's going to complicate later
    changes to dist, so drop support. This was primarily for supporting
    slow QEMU-based builders, but an alternative and simpler way to do
    that if we need to in the future is to supply a go_exec wrapper to run
    tests in QEMU, like we do for other emulated platforms.
    
    Simplification for #37486.
