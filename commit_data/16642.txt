    cmd/ld: fix line numbers when using fieldtrack
    
    USEFIELD is a special kind of NOP, so treat it like a NOP
    when generating the pc-ln table.
    
    There are more invasive fixes that could be applied here.
    I am going for minimum number of lines changed.
    
    The smallest test case we know of is five distinct Go files
    in four packages, and the bug only happens with
    GOEXPERIMENT=fieldtrack enabled, which we don't
    normally build with, so the test would never run
    meaningfully anyway.
    
    Fixes #5762.
