    [dev.typeparams] runtime: rewrite softfloat functions to avoid using floats
    
    Currently, most softfloat functions take uint32/64 arguments (for
    bit representation of float32/64) and operate on uint32/64. But
    there are exeptions where the function take float arguments and
    operate on float. So they are only actually softfloat if the
    helper functions themselves are translated (by the compiler's
    softfloat mode). These are mostly fine (besides being a bit
    convoluted). But with register ABIs this inconsistency adds
    complexity to the compiler to generate such calls, because it
    needs to be called with the right ABI.
    
    Rewrite the functions to operate on uint32/64 directly, using
    other helper functions. So they all take uint32/64 arguments and
    return uint32/64.
