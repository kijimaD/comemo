    net: deflake lookup tests
    
    The build dashboard is dotted with net test failures.
    We cannot declare all builders to have flaky networks,
    although all fundamentally do.
    
    Instead, add a simple retry/backoff loop to the ones that
    show up most commonly on the dashboard at this moment.
    
    If this approach works well in practice, we can
    incrementally apply it to other flaky net tests.
