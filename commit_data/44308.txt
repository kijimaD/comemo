    cmd/go/internal/mvs: split Reqs into narrower per-function interfaces
    
    Reqs currently combines requirements with upgrades and downgrades.
    However, only Upgrade needs the Upgrade method, and only Downgrade
    needs the Previous method.
    
    When we eventually add lazy loading, the lazily-loaded module graph
    will not be able to compute upgrades and downgrades, so the
    implementation work from here to there will be clearer if we are
    explicit about which are still needed.
    
    For #36460
