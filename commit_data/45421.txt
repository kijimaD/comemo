    go/types: ensure that error code values do not change in 1.17
    
    Over this cycle some error code values have changed due to codes being
    added/removed. This is probably OK to do once more before we export
    error codes in a later Go version, but for now let's keep them stable.
    
    Move things around to correct the changes, and update comments in
    errorcodes.go to make it clearer that new codes should be added at the
    end.
