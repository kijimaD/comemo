    runtime: drop redundant gcBlackenEnabled reset
    
    This reset of gcBlackenEnabled is a no-op because it was already reset
    almost immediately before in gcMarkDone, which is the only caller of
    gcMarkTermination.
    
    Adjust the comment to clarify setGCPhase a bit more. We are coming from
    _GCmark, so write barriers are already enabled.
