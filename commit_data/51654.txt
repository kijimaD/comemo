    make.bash, make.rc: fix GOROOT detection when GOEXPERIMENT is set
    
    We need to clear GOEXPERIMENT any time we are invoking a bootstrap
    toolchain. One line missed the clearing of GOEXPERIMENT.
    
    There were three different lines using different syntaxes and subtly
    different sets of variables being cleared, so hoist them into a function
    so it's all in one place.
    
    Also quote $GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP consistently.
