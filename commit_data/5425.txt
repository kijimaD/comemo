commit b3901dc1d8c64f7c46840fdda0b114fdc790e56c
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>
Date:   Mon May 3 11:07:22 2010 -0700

    Add _cgo_export.[ch] targets so that make knows how they are
    built.  Note that they are only built if a //export comment
    appears, so other targets should only use them if there is
    such a comment.
    
    Fixes #723.
