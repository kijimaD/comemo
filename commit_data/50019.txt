    runtime: move entry method from _func to funcInfo
    
    This will be required when we change from storing entry PCs in _func
    to entry PC offsets, which are relative to the containing module.
    
    Notably, almost all uses of the entry method were already called
    on a funcInfo. Only Func.Entry incurs the additional module
    lookup cost.
    
    This makes Entry considerably slower, but it is probably
    still fast enough in absolute terms that it is OK.
