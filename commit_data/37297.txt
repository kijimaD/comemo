    cmd/go: pass go language version to cmd/compile
    
    Pass the Go language version specified in the go.mod file to
    cmd/compile.
    
    Also, change the behavior when the go.mod file requests a Go version
    that is later than the current one. Previously cmd/go would give a
    fatal error in this situation. With this change it attempts the
    compilation, and if (and only if) the compilation fails it adds a note
    saying that the requested Go version is newer than the known version.
    This is as described in https://golang.org/issue/28221.
    
    Updates #28221.
