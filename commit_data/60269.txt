    net/http: check GetConfigForClient in server.ServeTLS
    
    Just like for tls.Config.GetCertificate the http.Server.ServeTLS method
    should be checking tls.Config.GetConfigForClient before trying top open
    the specified certFile/keyFile.
    
    This was previously fixed for crypto/tls when using tls.Listen in
    CL205059, but the same change for net/http was missed. I've added a
    comment src/crypto/tls/tls.go in the relevant section in the hope that
    any future changes of a similar nature consider will consider updating
    net/http as needed as well.
