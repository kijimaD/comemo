    internal/syscall/windows/registry: remove TestWalkFullRegistry due to false assumptions
    
    This test's existence was predicated upon assumptions about the full
    range of known data types and known data into those types. However,
    we've learned from Microsoft that there are several undocumented secret
    registry types that are in use by various parts of Windows, and we've
    learned from inspection that many Microsoft uses of registry types don't
    strictly adhere to the recommended value size. It's therefore foolhardy
    to make any assumptions about what goes in and out of the registry, and
    so this test, as well as its "blacklist", are meaningless.
    
    Fixes #35084
