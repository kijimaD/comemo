    doc/godebug: correct gotypealias=1 deprecation
    
    Per the note earlier in the page, GODEBUGs are maintained for a
    minimum of two years (four Go releases). Not said but certainly
    implied is that they are maintained for four Go releases from the
    point where people started needing to use them.
    
    Since people would start needing gotypesalias=0 in Go 1.23,
    it can be removed in Go 1.27.
