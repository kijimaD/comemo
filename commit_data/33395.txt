    syscall: really use utimensat for UtimesNano on Solaris
    
    golang.org/cl/55130 added utimensat for Solaris but didn't use it in
    UtimesNano (despite indicating otherwise in the commit message). Fix
    this by also using utimensat for UtimesNano on Solaris.
    
    Because all versions of Solaris suppported by Go support utimensat,
    there is no need for the fallback logic and utimensat can be called
    unconditionally.
    
    This issue was pointed out by Shawn Walker-Salas.
    
    Updates #16480
