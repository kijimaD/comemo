    cmd/go/internal/modfetch: do not use mangled version strings to construct module.VersionErrors
    
    Better still would be to avoid passing around module.Version instances
    with invalid Version strings in the first place, so that any time we
    see a module.Version we know that it is actually a version of a module
    (and not a structurally-similar datum with something else tacked on to
    one of the fields). But that's a bigger cleanup for which I don't
    currently have enough bandwidth.
    
    Fixes #41060
