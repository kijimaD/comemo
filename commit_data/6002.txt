commit 6610d79eda2e1e67d8601b004114e124228ef043
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    regexp: new regularized methods for matching.
    The previous set was spotty, incomplete, and confusing.
    This CL proposes a regular, clean set with clearer names.
    It's also complete.  Many existing methods will be deprecated,
    but not in this CL.  Ditto for the tests.
