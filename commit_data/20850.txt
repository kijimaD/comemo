    test: comment out failing cases from sinit.go
    
    One failing case this removes is:
    
    var bytes = []byte("hello, world")
    var copy_bytes = bytes
    
    We could handle this in the compiler, but it requires special
    case for a variable that is initialized to the value of a
    variable that is initialized to a string literal converted to
    []byte.  This seems an unlikely case--it never occurs in the
    standrd library--and it seems unnecessary to write the code to
    handle it.
    
    If we do want to support this case, one approach is
    https://golang.org/cl/171840043.
    
    The other failing cases are of the form
    
    var bx bool
    var copy_bx = bx
    
    The compiler used to initialize copy_bx to false.  However,
    that led to issue 7665, since bx may be initialized in non-Go
    code.  The compiler no longer assumes that bx must be false,
    so copy_bx can not be statically initialized.
    
    We can fix these with https://golang.org/cl/169040043
    if we also pass -complete to the compiler as part of this
    test.  This is OK but it's too late in the release cycle.
    
    Fixes #8746.
