    crypto/x509: add x509omitbundledroots build tag to not embed roots
    
    On darwin/arm64, the copy of the system roots takes 256 KiB of disk
    and 560 KiB of memory after parsing them (which is retained forever in
    a package global by x509/root.go). In constrained environments like
    iOS NetworkExtensions where total disk+RAM is capped at 15 MiB, these
    certs take 5.3% of the total allowed memory.
    
    It turns out you can get down from 816 KiB to 110 KiB by instead
    storing compressed x509 certs in the binary and lazily inflating just
    the needed certs at runtime as a function of the certs presented to
    you by the server, then building a custom root CertPool in the
    crypto/tls.Config.VerifyPeerCertificate hook.
    
    This then saves 706 KiB.
    
    Arguably that should be the default Go behavior, but involves
    cooperation between x509 and tls, and adds a dependency to
    compress/gzip. Also, it may not be the right trade-off for everybody,
    as it involves burning more CPU on new TLS connections. Most iOS apps
    don't run in a NetworkExtension context limiting them to 15 MiB.
    
    The build tag is chosen to match the existing "nethttpomithttp2".
