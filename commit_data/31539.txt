    reflect: don't panic in ArrayOf if elem size is 0
    
    We do a division by the elem type size to check if the array size would
    be too large for the virtual address space. This is a silly check if the
    size is 0, but the problem is that it means a division by zero and a
    panic.
    
    Since arrays of empty structs are valid in a regular program, make them
    also work in reflect.
    
    Use a separate, explicit test with struct{}{} to make sure the test for
    a zero-sized type is not confused with the rest.
    
    Fixes #20313.
