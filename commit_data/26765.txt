    cmd/go: clear cmd cache to avoid duplicate loads errors
    
    go get -u all command updates all packages including standard
    commands. We need to get commands evicted from their cache to
    avoid loading old versions of the packages evicted from the
    packages cache.
    
    Fixes #14444
