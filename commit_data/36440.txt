    fmt: print values for map keys with non-reflexive equality
    
    Previously fmt would first obtain a list of map keys
    and then look up the value for each key. Since NaNs can
    be map keys but cannot be fetched directly, the lookup would
    fail and return a zero reflect.Value, which formats as <nil>.
    
    golang.org/cl/33572 added a map iterator to the reflect package
    that is used in this CL to retrieve the key and value from
    the map and prints the correct value even for keys that are not
    equal to themselves.
    
    Fixes #14427
