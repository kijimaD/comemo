    cmd/compile: escape analysis needs to run "flood" to fixed point
    
    In some cases the members of the root set from which flood
    runs themselves escape, without their referents being also
    tagged as escaping.  Fix this by reflooding from those roots
    whose escape increases, and also enhance the "leak" test to
    include reachability from a heap-escaped root.
    
    Fixes #17318.
