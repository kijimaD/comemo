    database/sql: clone data for named []byte types
    
    Previously named byte types like json.RawMessage could get dirty
    database memory from a call to Scan. These types would activate a
    code path that didn't clone the byte data coming from the database
    before assigning it. Another thread could then overwrite the byte
    array in src, which has unexpected consequences.
    
    Originally reported by Jason Moiron; the patch and test are his
    suggestions. Fixes #13905.
