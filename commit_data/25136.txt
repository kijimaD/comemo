    crypto/x509: make verification of an empty certificate consistent across platforms.
    
    Platform-specific verification needs the ASN.1 contents of a certificate
    but that might not be provided if the Certificate was not created by
    ParseCertificate. In order to avoid a panic on Windows, and to make
    behaviour consistent across platforms, this change causes verification
    to fail when the ASN.1 contents of a certificate are not available.
    
    Fixes #12184
