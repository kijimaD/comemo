    go/types: avoid race condition with dot-imported objects
    
    It would be nice to have a test, but it requires running
    this under the race detector which is a bit complicated
    to set up; yet the fix is trivial. Verified manually that
    it doesn't trip the race detector.
    
    Fixes #32154.
