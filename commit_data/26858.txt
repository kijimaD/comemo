    cmd/compile/internal/s390x: add s390x support
    
    s390x does not require duffzero/duffcopy since it has
    storage-to-storage instructions that can copy/clear up to 256
    bytes at a time.
    
    peep contains several new passes to optimize instruction
    sequences that match s390x instructions such as the
    compare-and-branch and load/store multiple instructions.
    
    copyprop and subprop have been extended to work with moves that
    require sign/zero extension. This work could be ported to other
    architectures that do not used sized math however it does add
    complexity and will probably be rendered unnecessary by ssa in
    the near future.
