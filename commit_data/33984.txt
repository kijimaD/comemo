    runtime: simplify stack walk in panicwrap
    
    panicwrap currently uses runtime.Callers and runtime.CallersFrames to
    find the name of its caller. Simplify this by using getcallerpc.
    
    This will be important for #16723, since to fix that we're going to
    make CallersFrames skip the wrapper method, which is exactly what
    panicwrap needs to see.
