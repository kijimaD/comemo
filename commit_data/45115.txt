    encoding/asn1: clarify use of SET suffix
    
    This change clarifies the usage of the SET type name suffix. Previously
    the documentation was somewhat confusing about where the suffix should
    be used, and when used what it applied to. For instance the previous
    language could be interpreted such that []exampleSET would be parsed as
    a SEQUENCE OF SET, which is incorrect as the SET suffix only applies to
    slice types, such as type exampleSET []struct{} which is parsed as a
    SET OF SEQUENCE.
