    crypto/x509: better documentation for ParsePKIXPublicKey
    
    The existing documentation for ParsePKIXPublicKey is difficult to understand
    and the return type of the parsed public key are not mentioned explicitly.
    
    Descriptions about types of public key supported, as well as an example on
    how to use type assertions to determine return type of a parsed public key
    has been added.
    
    Fixes #14355
