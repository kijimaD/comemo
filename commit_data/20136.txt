    io: document that Readers and Writers must not retain buffers
    
    There are both many callers and many implementations of these
    interfaces, so make the contract explicit. Callers generally
    assume this, and at least the standard library and other
    implementations obey this, but it's never stated explicitly,
    making it somewhat risky to assume.
