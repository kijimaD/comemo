commit 03bf6f4917c1c8cd883dfa1618b90a95b9192f9a
Author: Dmitri Shuralyov <dmitshur@golang.org>

    run.bash, cmd/dist: document GO_TEST_SHORT and GO_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE
    
    These environment variables affect cmd/dist, and in turn run.bash.
    They exist primarily for the Go build system, but are still needed
    sometimes when investigating problems. Document them in one place.
    
    Fixes #46054.
