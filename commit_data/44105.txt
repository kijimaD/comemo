    image/png: remove too early declaration of "n"
    
    Before this commit, the code declares and assigns "n" with the result of
    io.ReadFull() -- but the value is not used.  The variable is then reused
    later in the function.
    
    This commit removes the first declaration of "n" and declares it closer
    to where it is used.
