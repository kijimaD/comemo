commit 6d3d25de2100fece265be9e76d1a3bc0a80270aa
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 28 14:54:49 2009 -0700

    Ring ADT.
    - Provides analogous functionality to a doubly-linked list
      implementation.
    - Completely symmetric set of operations.
    - Operations on the ADT do not lead to results that are
      outside the domain of the ADT (closed interface).
    - Alternative to container/list.
