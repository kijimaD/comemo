    cmd/go: don't fail on missing runtime/internal/sys/zversion.go
    
    The generated file runtime/internal/sys/zversion.go is deleted by
    `go tool cmd dist clean` as part of running clean.bash. Don't treat
    a missing file as a reason to stop running the go tool; just treat
    is as meaning that runtime/internal/sys is stale.
    
    No test because I don't particularly want to clobber $GOROOT.
    
    Fixes #20385.
