    runtime/pprof: accept fewer PCs
    
    TestBlockProfile currently requires exactly five PCs in each sample.
    With more aggressive inlining there may be fewer, so change this test
    to use the same pattern as TestMutexProfile, which accepts one or more
    PCs. With this change, this test passes when compiled with -l=4.
