    crypto/x509: mitigate CVE-2020-0601 verification bypass on Windows
    
    An attacker can trick the Windows system verifier to use a poisoned set
    of elliptic curve parameters for a trusted root, allowing it to generate
    spoofed signatures. When this happens, the returned chain will present
    the unmodified original root, so the actual signatures won't verify (as
    they are invalid for the correct parameters). Simply double check them
    as a safety measure and mitigation.
    
    Windows users should still install the system security patch ASAP.
    
    This is the same mitigation adopted by Chromium:
