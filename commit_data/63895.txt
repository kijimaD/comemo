commit 614f2284d94364f8e245e2c6ea9b4eca50e650d1

    doc/initial, doc/next: add draft notice to introduction
    
    Go release notes always start out as a draft with a clear notice.
    That notice is removed when the final release (go1.N.0) is made.
    For example, the last time was in CL 562255.
    
    Add this to the Go 1.23 draft and to the future fragment template.
    
    Also switch to the main pkg.go.dev instance and use a relative issue
    link in 3-tools.md while here.
    
    For #64169.
    For #65614.
