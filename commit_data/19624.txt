    runtime: fix nacl amd64p32 flakiness
    
    newproc takes two extra pointers, not two extra registers.
    On amd64p32 (nacl) they are different.
    
    We diagnosed this before the 1.3 cut but the tree was frozen.
    I believe this is causing the random problems on the builder.
    
    Fixes #8199.
