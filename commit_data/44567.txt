    cmd/trace: move viewer data structs into cmd/internal/traceviewer
    
    The ViewerEvent, ViewerData and ViewerFrame structs are moved into
    cmd/internal/traceviewer, and renamed Event, Data, and Frame.
    
    The structs are the same, except for the following: A definition
    for the JSON "bp" field that's defined in the trace format, but
    missing in the structs has been added. Also, the Tid and Pid fields
    on Event have been renamed TID and PID to better match Go style.
    Finally, the footer field on ViewerData, which hasn't been used
    for a while, has been removed.
    
    This CL is in preparation for the usage of these structs by cmd/go's
    tracing functionality.
    
    Updates #38714
