    math/big: fix nil bug in GobEncode
    
    Update #5305.
    This handles the case where the nil pointers are inside a slice.
    A top-level nil pointer is harder, maybe fundamentally broken by gob's model.
    Thinking required.
    However, a slice is the important case since people don't expect to be sending
    top-level nils much, but they can arise easily in slices.
