    cmd/compile/internal/walk: relocate a stray comment
    
    The explanatory comment and the associated version counter variable
    for the helper routine "wrapCall" seem to have been left behind in
    walk.go during the big refactoring -- move it back to where it should
    be, next to wrapCall in stmt.go. Also fix a small buglet in the
    comment itself.
