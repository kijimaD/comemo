    runtime: reduce timing sensitivity in TestEINTR
    
    - Don't assume that a process interrupted at 100Î¼s intervals will have
      enough remaining time to make progress. (Stop sending signals
      in between signal storms to allow the process to quiesce.)
    
    - Don't assume that a child process that spins for 1ms will block long
      enough for the parent process to receive signals or make meaningful
      progress. (Instead, have the child block indefinitely, and unblock
      it explicitly after the signal storm.)
