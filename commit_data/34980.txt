commit 7b57e21a075b876903c735b3988a5be86c01f078
Author: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>

    runtime: skip gdb tests earlier before blocking goroutines in a t.Parallel
    
    Minor.
    
    Makes reading failing runtime test stacktraces easier (by having fewer
    goroutines to read) on machines where these gdb tests wouldn't have
    ever run anyway.
