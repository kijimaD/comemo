    cmd/go: improve documentation on defaults for get
    
    The existing docs states that, get looks for a branch or tag
    that matches the locally installed version of Go.
    First, this is only working for "go1", so it could be confusing.
    Second, "If no such version exists it retrieves the most recent
    version of the package". It's more the default branch, by git defaults,
    rather than most recent version.
    
    This should address the potential unclear parts.
    
    Fixes #20320
