    cmd/5g, cmd/5l, cmd/ld: Small adjustments for the Plan 9 native tools
    
    A few USED(xxx) additions and a couple of deletions of variable
    initialisations that go unused.  One questionable correction,
    mirrored in 8l/asm.c, where the result of invocation of a function
    shouldn't be used.
