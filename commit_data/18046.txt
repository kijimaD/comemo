    crypto/x509: set default signature hash to SHA256 and allow override.
    
    Previously the hash used when signing an X.509 certificate was fixed
    and, for RSA, it was fixed to SHA1. Since Microsoft have announced the
    deprecation of SHA1 in X.509 certificates, this change switches the
    default to SHA256.
    
    It also allows the hash function to be controlled by the caller by
    setting the SignatureAlgorithm field of the template.

    Fixes #5302.
