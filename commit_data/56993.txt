    cmd/asm: change register type for loong64 floating-point
    
    On Loong64, the two input operands and one output operand of the ADDF
    instruction are both floating-point registers; and the floating-point
    comparison instruction CMPEQ{F,D}, CMPGE{F,D}, CMPGT{F,D} both input
    operands are floating-point registers, and the output operation is a
    floating-point condition register, currently, only FCC0 is used as the
    floating-point condition register.
    
    Example:
            ADDF    F0, F1, F0
            CMPEQF  F0, F1, FCC0
