    runtime: fix lldb test after DWARF compression
    
    Most (all?) released versions of lldb don't support compressed DWARF.
    For now, skip the test if lldb can't find where to put the breakpoint.
    
    This is the best I could think of -- there is no explicit error that I
    can find that indicates it couldn't load the DWARF.
    
    Fixes #25925.
