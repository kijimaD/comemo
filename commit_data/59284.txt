    os: factor out newFileStatFromWin32FileAttributeData
    
    The stat function is quite long on Windows. Simplify it a bit by
    factoring out the creation of a fileStat from a Win32FileAttributeData.
    
    This also makes it more consistent with the creation of fileStats
    from other sources, which all have their own dedicated functions.
