    runtime: increase stack split limit again
    
    Increase NOSPLIT reservation from 192 to 384 bytes.
    The problem is that the non-Unix systems (Solaris and Windows)
    just can't make system calls in a small amount of space,
    and then worse they do things that are complex enough
    to warrant calling runtime.throw on failure.
    We don't have time to rewrite the code to use less stack.
    
    I'm not happy about this, but it's still a small amount.
    
    The good news is that we're doing this to get to only
    using copying stacks for stack growth. Once that is true,
    we can drop the default stack size from 8k to 4k, which
    should more than make up for the bytes we're losing here.
