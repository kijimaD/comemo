    runtime: on unexpected netpoll error, throw instead of looping
    
    The current code prints an error message and then tries to carry on.
    This is not helpful for Go users: they see a message that means
    nothing and that they can do nothing about.  In the only known case of
    this message, in issue 11498, the best guess is that the netpoll code
    went into an infinite loop.  Instead of doing that, crash the program.
    
    Fixes #11498.
