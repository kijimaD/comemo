    compress/flate: add optional runtime sanity checks
    
    This code's test coverage is ad hoc at best, and it's easy to make
    changes that accidentally regress invariants.  This CL adds a "sanity"
    constant that can be changed to "true" during development to add extra
    runtime checking that the Huffman decoder tables are sane.
