    net/http/pprof: updated documentation (run an http server)
    
    Added instructions for starting an http server
    to the godoc header for this package.  With the old
    instructions, the example "go tool pprof..." commands
    wouldn't work unless you happen to be running an http
    server on port 6060 in your application.
