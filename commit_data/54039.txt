    cmd/go: skip gccgo_link_c when cross-compiling
    
    I don't understand the rationale given in
    https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/commit/community/go/tests-unset-GCCGO.patch?id=a10e9a5e48507198e26a8cf19709e4059da4c79f,
    but I suspect that it may be working around test failures when
    cross-compiling, since we have a lot of other gccgo tests that need to
    skip in that circumstance.
    
    Alternatively, that may just be a stale patch working around #53815.
    I can't fine any issue filed against the Go project for this patch,
    so it's hard to be sure.
    
    Either way, adding this skip should make the test more robust.
    
    For #62053.
