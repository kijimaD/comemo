commit a329471ced905effe0282e011a668bdc5779b0f1
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    A first attempt to capture the type changes.
    
    Instead of trying to make open arrays look like arrays (which they aren't,
    they just look like them), I decided to call them "slice types". As a result
    they have value semantics, and one can really talk about what they really are.
    
    Note:
    - There are lots of missing details
    - There are probably lots of mistakes
    
    Looking for some initial feedback.
