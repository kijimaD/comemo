    crypto/x509: don't fail to parse addition elements in GeneralSubtree.
    
    The GeneralSubtree structure can have additional elements after the name
    (minimum and maximum, which are unused). Previously these fields, if
    present, would cause a parse error. This change allows trailing data in
    the GeneralSubtrees structure.
