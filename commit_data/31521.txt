    net/url: document the package better
    
    Changes made:
    * Adjust the documented form for a URL to make it more obvious what
    happens when the scheme is missing.
    * Remove references to Go1.5. We are sufficiently far along enough
    that this distinction no longer matters.
    * Remove the "Opaque" example which provides a hacky and misleading
    use of the Opaque field. This workaround is no longer necessary
    since RawPath was added in Go1.5 and the obvious approach just works:
            // The raw string "/%2f/" will be sent as expected.
            req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://example.com/%2f/")
    
    Fixes #18824
