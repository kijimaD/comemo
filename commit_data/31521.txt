    runtime/pprof: deflake TestGoroutineCounts
    
    TestGoroutineCounts currently depends on timing to get 100 goroutines
    to a known blocking point before taking a profile. This fails
    frequently, with different goroutines captured at different stacks.
    The test is disabled on openbsd because it was too flaky, but in fact
    it flakes on all platforms.
    
    Fix this by using Gosched instead of timing. This is both much more
    reliable and makes the test run faster.
    
    Fixes #15156.
