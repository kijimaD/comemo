    net: fix Dial(":80") on Plan 9
    
    CL 32101 fixed Dial(":80") on Windows and added TestDialLocal,
    which was failing on Plan 9, because it wasn't implemented
    on Plan 9.
    
    This change implements Dial(":80") by connecting to 127.0.0.1
    or ::1 (depending on network), so it works as documented.
    
    Fixes #17760.
