    path/filepath, os/exec: unquote PATH elements on Windows
    
    On Windows, directory names in PATH can be fully or partially quoted
    in double quotes ('"'), but the path names as used by most APIs must
    be unquoted. In addition, quoted names can contain the semicolon
    (';') character, which is otherwise used as ListSeparator.
    
    This CL changes SplitList in path/filepath and LookPath in os/exec
    to only treat unquoted semicolons as separators, and to unquote the
    separated elements.
    
    (In addition, fix harmless test bug I introduced for LookPath on Unix.)
