    test/run: always set goos and goarch
    
    Following CL 68150047, the goos and goarch
    variables are not currently set when the GOOS
    and GOARCH environment variables are not set.
    
    This made the content of the build tag to be
    ignored in this case.
    
    This CL sets goos and goarch to runtime.GOOS
    and runtime.GOARCH when the GOOS and GOARCH
    environments variables are not set.
