    os: drop unnecessary trailing . from symlink targets
    
    Adjust splitPathInRoot to match its documented behavior
    of dropping . path components except at the end of the path.
    This function takes a prefix, path, and suffix; previously
    it would preserve a trailing . at the end of the path
    even when joining to a suffix.
    
    The practical effect of this change is that we we'll skip
    a pointless open of . when following a symlink under some
    circumstances:
    
      - open "a/target"
      - "a" is a symlink to "b/."
      - previously: we rewrite our path to "b/./target"
      - now: we rewrite our path to "b/target"
    
    This is a fairly unimportant edge case, and our observable
    behavior isn't changing. The main motivation for this change is
    that the overall behavior is more comprehensible if splitPathInRoot
    follows its documentation.
