    runtime: remove outdated comment in select sortkey
    
    This CL removes an outdated comment regarding converting a pointer to `uintptr`.
    The comment was introduced in Go 1.4 and runtime GC was under the consideration of major revisions. According to the current situation, Go runtime memory allocator has no fragmentation issue. Therefore compact GC won't be implemented in the near future.
