    spec: clarify conditions for switch expression type
    
    1. The existing prose implied that a switch expression type must
       be comparable because it is tested for equality against all case
       expressions. But for an empty switch (no case expressions), it
       was not clear if the switch expression needed to be comparable.
       Require it to match the behavior of compiler and type checkers.
    
    2. While making this change, remove redundant language explaining
       what happens with untyped boolean switch expression values: the
       default type of an untyped boolean value is bool, this is already
       covered by the first part of the relevant sentence.
    
    Fixes #43200.
