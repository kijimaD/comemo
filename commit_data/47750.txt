    cmd/objdump: update test with register ABI
    
    With register ABI, the disassembly of the function may not
    contain a "movq" instruction (which used to be e.g. storing
    arguments to stack). Look for "jmp" instruction instead. This is
    also in consistent with the test for Go assembly syntax.
