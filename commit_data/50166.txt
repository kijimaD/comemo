    cmd/compile/obj/arm64: fix encoding error of FMOVD/FMOVS $0|ZR
    
    Previously the first operand of FMOVD and FMOVS could be $0, which
    would be converted to the ZR register. This is prohibited by CL 404316,
    also it broken the encoding of "FMOVD/FMOVS ZR, Rn", this CL restores
    this instruction format and fixes the encoding issue.
    
    Fixes #54655.
    Fixes #54729.
