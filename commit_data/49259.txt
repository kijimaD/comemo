    [dev.typeparams] runtime: handle d.link carefully when freeing a defer
    
    CL 339396 allowed stack copying on entry to and during freedefer, but
    this introduced a subtle bug: if d is heap-allocated, and d.link
    points to a stack-allocated defer, stack copying during freedefer can
    briefly introduce a stale pointer, which the garbage collector can
    discover and panic about. This happens because d has already been
    unlinked from the defer chain when freedefer is called, so stack
    copying won't update stack pointers in it.
    
    Fix this by making freedefer nosplit again and immediately clearing
    d.link.
    
    This should fix the longtest builders, which currently fail on
    GOMAXPROCS=2 runtime -cpu=1,2,4 -quick in the TestDeferHeapAndStack
    test.
    
    This seems like the simplest fix, but it just deals with the subtlety
    rather than eliminating it. Really, every call site of freedefer (of
    which there are surprisingly many) has hidden subtlety between
    unlinking the defer and calling freedefer. We could consolidate the
    subtlety into each call site by requiring that they unlink the defer
    and set d.link to nil before calling freedefer. freedefer could check
    this condition like it checks that various other fields have already
    been zeroed. A more radical option is to replace freedefer with
    "popDefer", which would both pop the defer off the link and take care
    of freeing it. There would still be a brief moment of subtlety, but it
    would be in one place, in popDefer. Annoyingly, *almost* every call to
    freedefer just pops the defer from the head of the G's list, but
    there's one place when handling open-coded defers where we have to
    remove a defer from the middle of the list. I'm inclined to first fix
    that subtlety by only expanding open-coded defer records when they're
    at the head of the defer list, and then revisit the popDefer idea.
