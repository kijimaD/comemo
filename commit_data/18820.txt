    net/http: eliminate defined-but-not-used var.
    
    gc does not report this as an error, but go/types does.
    (I suspect that constructing a closure counts as a reference
    to &all in gc's implementation).
    
    This is not a tool bug, since the spec doesn't require
    implementations to implement this check, but it does
    illustrate that dialect variations are always a nuisance.
