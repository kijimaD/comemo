    time: increase arbitrary upper bound in TestReset to 10s
    
    The previous upper bound was around 0.375 s, which is empirically
    too short on a slow, heavily-loaded builder. Since the test doesn't
    seem to depend on the actual duration in any meaningful way, let's
    make it several orders of magnitude larger.
    
    Fixes #61266.
