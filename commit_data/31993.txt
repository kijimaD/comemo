    runtime: save r11 in ARM addmoduledata
    
    R11 is callee-save in the C ABI, but the temporary register in the Go
    ABI. Currently it's being clobbered by runtime.addmoduledata, which
    has to follow the C ABI. The observed effect of this was that
    dl_open_worker was returning to a bad PC because after it failed to
    restore its SP because it was using R11 as a frame pointer.
    
    Fix this by saving R11 around addmoduledata.
    
    Fixes #19674.
