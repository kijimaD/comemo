    crypto/x509: reformat template members in docs
    
    It's easier to skim a list of items visually when the
    items are each on a separate line. Separate lines also
    help reduce diff size when items are added/removed.
    
    The list is indented so that it's displayed preformatted
    in HTML output as godoc doesn't support formatting lists
    natively yet (see #7873).
