    cmd/gc: move large stack variables to heap
    
    Individual variables bigger than 10 MB are now
    moved to the heap, as if they had escaped on
    their own.
    
    This avoids ridiculous stacks for programs that
    do things like
            x := [1<<30]byte{}
            ... use x ...
    
    If 10 MB is too small, we can raise the limit.
    
    Fixes #6077.
