    encoding/json: revert "add "json: " prefix to SyntaxError messages"
    
    This reverts commit 6af088bfc66c13143c9ef46b4cf0805df77a8fbe.
    
    Reason for revert: Broke many tests inside Google which implies many
    tests were broken outside of Google as well. The tests may be brittle
    but still would require work to change and it's not clear it's worth
    the benefit.
    
    Updates #36221
    Fixes #42675
