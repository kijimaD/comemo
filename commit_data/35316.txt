    CONTRIBUTING: remove Pull Request bit
    
    Also remove the "Also, please do not post patches on the issue
    tracker" part, since that didn't seem to reduce the number of patches
    inlined into bug reports. And now that we accept PRs, people will
    probably try that first. We'll see.
    
    Fixes #23779
    Updates #18517
