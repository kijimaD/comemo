    net: only perform IPv4 map check for AF_INET6 sockets
    
    This change avoids executing syscalls testing if IPv4 address mapping
    is possible unless the socket being opened belongs to the AF_INET6
    family.
    
    In a pledged OpenBSD process, this test is only allowed when the
    "inet" pledge is granted; however this check was also being performed
    for AF_UNIX sockets (separately permitted under the "unix" pledge),
    and would cause the process to be killed by the kernel.  By avoiding
    the IPv4 address mapping check until the socket is checked to be
    AF_INET6, a pledged OpenBSD process using AF_UNIX sockets without the
    "inet" pledge won't be killed for this misbehavior.
    
    The OpenBSD kernel is not currently ready to support using UNIX domain
    sockets with only the "unix" pledge (and without "inet"), but this is
    one change necessary to support this.
