    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: don't alloc new CSE classes
    
    This reduces the time to compile
    test/slice3.go on my laptop from ~12s to ~3.8s.
    It reduces the max memory use from ~4.8gb to
    ~450mb.
    
    This is still considerably worse than tip,
    at 1s and 300mb respectively, but it's
    getting closer.
    
    Hopefully this will fix the build at long last.
