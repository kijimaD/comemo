    runtime: add test for mutex starvation
    
    When multiple threads all need to acquire the same runtime.mutex, make
    sure that none of them has to wait for too long. Measure how long a
    single thread can capture the mutex, and how long individual other
    threads must go between having a turn with the mutex.
    
    For #68578
