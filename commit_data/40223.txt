    runtime: make goroutine for wasm async events short-lived
    
    An extra goroutine is necessary to handle asynchronous events on wasm.
    However, we do not want this goroutine to exist all the time.
    This change makes it short-lived, so it ends after the asynchronous
    event was handled.
    
    Fixes #34768
