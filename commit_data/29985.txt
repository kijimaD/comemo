    archive/tar: make Reader handle GNU format properly
    
    The GNU format does not have a prefix field, so we should make
    no attempt to read it. It does however have atime and ctime fields.
    Since Go previously placed incorrect values here, we liberally
    read the atime and ctime fields and ignore errors so that old tar
    files written by Go can at least be partially read.
    
    This fixes half of #12594. The Writer is much harder to fix.
    
    Updates #12594
