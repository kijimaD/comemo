-TODO stack copying, no longer segmented
+Go 1.3 has changed the implementation of goroutine stacks away from the old,
+"segmented" model to a contiguous model.
+When a goroutine needs more stack
+than is available, its stack is transferred to a larger single block of memory.
+The overhead of this transfer operation amortizes well and eliminates the old "hot spot"
+problem when a calculation repeatedly steps across a segment boundary.
+Details including performance numbers are in this
