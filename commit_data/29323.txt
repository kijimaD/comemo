    runtime: fix SIGILL in checkvectorfacility on s390x
    
    STFLE does not necessarily write to all the double-words that are
    requested. It is therefore necessary to clear the target memory
    before calling STFLE in order to ensure that the facility list does
    not contain false positives.
    
    Fixes #17032.
