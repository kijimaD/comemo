    runtime: store consistent total allocation stats as uint64
    
    Currently the consistent total allocation stats are managed as uintptrs,
    which means they can easily overflow on 32-bit systems. Fix this by
    storing these stats as uint64s. This will cause some minor performance
    degradation on 32-bit systems, but there really isn't a way around this,
    and it affects the correctness of the metrics we export.
    
    Fixes #52680.
