    internal/testenv: reduce init-time work for MustHaveExec
    
    In CL 486275 I added a somewhat complex init function that sets up a
    callback to probe for exec support. A lot of the complexity was simply
    to avoid an unnecessary call to os.Environ during init.
    
    In CL 491660, I made the os.Environ call unconditional on all
    platforms anyway in order to make HasGoBuild more robust.
    
    Since the init-function indirection no longer serves a useful purpose,
    I would like to simplify it to a package-level function, avoiding the
    complexity of changing package variables at init time.
