    cmd/compile: rework marking of dead hidden closure functions
    
    This patch generalizes the code in the inliner that marks unreferenced
    hidden closure functions as dead. Rather than doing the marking on the
    fly (previous approach), this new approach does a single pass at the
    end of inlining, which catches more dead functions.
    
    Fixes #59638.
    Updates #59404.
    Updates #59547.
