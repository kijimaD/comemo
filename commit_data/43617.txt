    runtime: tidy Context allocation
    
    The Context object we pass to GetThreadContext on Windows must be 16
    byte-aligned. We also can't allocate in the contexts where we create
    these, so they must be stack-allocated. There's no great way to do
    this, but this CL makes the code at least a little clearer, and makes
    profilem and preemptM more consistent with each other.
