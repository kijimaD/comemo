    runtime: 8-byte align the heap_live field for atomic access
    
    mheap_.heap_live is an atomically accessed uint64. It is currently not 8-byte
    aligned on 32-bit platforms, which has been okay because it's only accessed via
    Xadd64, which doesn't require alignment on 386 or ARM32. However, Xadd64 on
    MIPS32 does require 8-byte alignment.
    
    Add a padding field to force 8-byte alignment of heap_live and prevent an
    alignment check crash on MIPS32.
