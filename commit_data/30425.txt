    crypto/sha512: fix checkAVX2
    
    The checkAVX2 test doesn't appear to be correct,
    because it always returns the value of support_bmi2,
    even if the value of support_avx2 is false.
    
    Consequently, checkAVX2 always returns true, as long
    as BMI2 is supported, even if AVX2 is not supported.
    
    We change checkAVX2 to return false when support_avx2
    is false.
    
    Fixes #19316.
