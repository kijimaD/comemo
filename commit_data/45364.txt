    go/scanner: improve variety in benchmarks for file scanning
    
    BenchmarkScanFile was scanning scanner.go, which makes comparison
    difficult for a CL modifying that file. That file is also is not
    necessarily representative syntax.
    
    Add a few additional files as subtests to provide a larger variety of
    metrics.
