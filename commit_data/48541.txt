    net/http: correct Client.Do doc about context cancelation
    
    The documentation of the Client.Do method and Get function incorrectly
    stated that, in case of context cancelation, the returned url.Error
    Timeout method returns true.
    
    Update the documentation to correctly match the implementation.
    See also CL 200798 that, due to an oversight, corrected only the
    documentation of the Client.Get method.
    
    Remove a TODO note added in CL 125575 (net/http: document that Client
    methods always return *url.Error), since it is no longer applicable
    after CL 200798 (net/http: fix and lock-in Client.Do docs on request
    cancelation).
    
    Fixes #46402
