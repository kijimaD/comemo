    cmd/go: add basic docs on calling between Go and C/C++
    
    This is a framework for docs on the subject more than it is
    actual docs.
    
    The section header in go/doc.go just says "C", not "C/C++,"
    because otherwise godoc doesn't recognize the line as a
    section header.
    
    Fixes #5473.

+Calling between Go and C
+
+There are two different ways to call between Go and C/C++ code.
+
+The first is the cgo tool, which is part of the Go distribution.  For
+information on how to use it see the cgo documentation (godoc cmd/cgo).
+
+The second is the SWIG program, which is a general tool for
+interfacing between languages.  For information on SWIG see
+http://swig.org/.  When running go build, any file with a .swig
+extension will be passed to SWIG.  Any file with a .swigcxx extension
+will be passed to SWIG with the -c++ option.
+
+When either cgo or SWIG is used, go build will pass any .c, .s, or .S
+files to the C compiler, and any .cc, .cpp, .cxx files to the C++
+compiler.  The CC or CXX environment variables may be set to determine
+the C or C++ compiler, respectively, to use.
+
+
 GOPATH environment variable
 
 The Go path is used to resolve import statements.
