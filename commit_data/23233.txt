    runtime/cgo, cmd/dist: turn off exc_bad_access handler by default
    
    App Store policy requires programs do not reference the exc_server
    symbol. (Some public forum threads show that Unity ran into this
    several years ago and it is a hard policy rule.) While some research
    suggests that I could write my own version of exc_server, the
    expedient course is to disable the exception handler by default.
    
    Go programs only need it when running under lldb, which is primarily
    used by tests. So enable the exception handler in cmd/dist when we
    are running the tests.
    
    Fixes #10646
