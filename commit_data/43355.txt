    doc: decrease prominence of GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP
    
    Go build scripts on UNIX (make.bash, all.bash) have not required
    GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP since August 2017 (CL 57753). Windows build scripts
    have followed suit since CL 96455. Most people building Go will have
    a Go toolchain in their PATH and will not need to specify a different
    toolchain.
    
    This CL removes the GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP mention from the contribution guide
    (it was there for Windows only, but it's not required anymore). The guide
    is meant to be light and clear for beginners and is not supposed to be
    a reference, so there's not need to keep mentioning GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP.
    
    Also update install-source.html to reflect the current status quo,
    where using the PATH is probably the first and most used default, and
    GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP is just an option.

 <p>
 The Go toolchain is written in Go. To build it, you need a Go compiler installed.
-The scripts that do the initial build of the tools look for an existing Go tool
-chain in <code>$GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP</code>.
-If unset, the default value of <code>GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP</code>
-is <code>$HOME/go1.4</code>.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-There are many options for the bootstrap toolchain.
-After obtaining one, set <code>GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP</code> to the
-directory containing the unpacked tree.
-For example, <code>$GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP/bin/go</code> should be
-the <code>go</code> command binary for the bootstrap toolchain.
-</p>
+The scripts that do the initial build of the tools look for a "go" command
+in <code>$PATH</code>, so as long as you have Go installed in your
+system and configured in your <code>$PATH</code>, you are ready to build Go
+from source. 
+Or if you prefer you can set <code>$GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP</code> to the
+root of a Go installation to use to build the new Go toolchain;
+<code>$GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP/bin/go</code> should be the go command to use.</p>
