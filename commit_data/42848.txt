    go/types: fix missing Importer for TestBenchmark
    
    TestBenchmark is broken due to lack of a Config.Importer, but
    unfortunately fails silently due to an unchecked error.
    
    Fix the importer and check the error. Also improve the output to include
    allocation stats.
    
    Finally, don't run TestBenchmark on go/types by default. If the
    benchmark is being used during a refactoring of go/types itself, results
    for go/types will not be comparable.
