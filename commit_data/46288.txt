    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: setup to move Addrconst, Patch into cmd/internal/obj
    
    Deleting the Pc assignment from Patch is safe because the actual PCs
    are not assigned until well after the compiler is done patching jumps.
    And it proves that replacing uses of Patch with SetTarget will be safe later.
