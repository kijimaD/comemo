    5g, 6g, 8g: flush modified globals aggressively
    
    The alternative is to record enough information that the
    trap handler know which registers contain cached globals
    and can flush the registers back to their original locations.
    That's significantly more work.
    
    This only affects globals that have been written to.
    Code that reads from a global should continue to registerize
    as well as before.
    
    Fixes #1304.
