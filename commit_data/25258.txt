    text/template: resolve non-empty interface
    
    Read what a non-empty interface points to.
    
    The deleted lines were added in https://codereview.appspot.com/4810060/,
    which attempted to break an infinite loop. That was a long time ago.
    If I just delete these lines with current codebase, the test "bug1"
    (added in that CL) does not fail.
    
    All new tests fail without this fix.
    
    Fixes #12924
