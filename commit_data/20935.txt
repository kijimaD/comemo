 The latest Go release, version 1.4, arrives as scheduled six months after 1.3
 and contains only one tiny language change,
+a possibly breaking change to the compiler,
 a backwards-compatible simple form of <code>for</code>-<code>range</code> loop.
 The release focuses primarily on implementation work, improving the garbage collector
 and preparing the ground for a fully concurrent collector to be rolled out in the

+The Go specification allows a single dereference to be inserted automatically,

+It has therefore been disallowed in Go 1.4, which is a breaking change,

-misc: deleted editor support; refer to https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins instead (CL 105470043)
+The standard repository's top-level <code>misc</code> directory used to contain
+Go support for editors and IDEs: plugins, initialization scripts and so on.
+Maintaining these was becoming time-consuming
+and needed external help because many of the editors listed were not used by
+members of the core team.
+It also required us to make decisions about which plugin was best for a given
+editor, even for editors we do not use.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+The Go community at large is much better suited to managing this information.
+In Go 1.4, therefore, this support has been removed from the repository.
+Instead, there is a curated, informative list of what's available on
+a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins">wiki page</a>.
