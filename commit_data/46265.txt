    [dev.typeparams] go/types: import object resolution from dev.go2go
    
    Changes from dev.go2go:
     + Removed enableImplicitTParam
     + Fixed a bug in unpackRecv where pointer receivers were not being
       detected in the syntax. This didn't seem to actually matter, as I
       couldn't produce an incorrect test case as a result of this bug (I
       guess by the time method sets are considered, functions have already
       been type checked).
     + Updated to the new error API.
     + A line setting t.underlying to Typ[Invalid] was restored in
       Checker.validType when a cycle is detected. Though this didn't seem
       to matter, it preserves an invariant that invalid types are used to
       suppress error reporting.
