    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: avoid general traversal in deadcode
    
    deadcode is trying to walk the statements it can find,
    but it can sweep in other nodes too. Stop doing that:
    only walk known statements containing statements.
    
    Otherwise, if we put panics in expression accessors that
    shouldn't be used anymore, deadcode can trip them.
    
    deadcode would be a good candidate to rewrite using
    EditChildren, but that would certainly cause toolstash
    changes, since deadcode is so ad-hoc about exactly
    which parts of the function it looks at. For now just
    remove the general traversal and leave as is.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
