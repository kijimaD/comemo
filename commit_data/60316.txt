    cmd/compile: give the closure generated for rangefunc bodies a name.
    
    The generated name has the form "#yield%d" for %d = 1, 2, 3, ...
    This may help the debugger connect execution within a rangefunc
    loop's body to the frame containing the rest of the source code.
    (It may not actually be necessary; we need to confirm with Alessandro
    Aarzilli or someone else on the Delve team.)
