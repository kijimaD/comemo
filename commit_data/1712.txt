commit 5af7de3fe37378cb61060e554b885b1f26a8f8f6
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 15:17:59 2009 -0800

    Updated the section on Types.
    Moved assignment compatibility to its own small section. Although most rules are type-specific,
    some are not and it reduces redundancy to combine them.
    Also, more experimentally, wrote a section on comparison compatibility.
