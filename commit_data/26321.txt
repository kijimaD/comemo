    cmd/dist: restrict parallel tests to NumCPU on mips64x
    
    mips64 builder and one machine of the mips64le builder has small amount
    of memory. Since CL 18199, they have been running slowly, as more
    processes were launched in running 'test' directory, and a lot of swap
    were used. This CL brings all.bash from 5h back to 3h on Loongson 2E
    with 512 MB memory.
