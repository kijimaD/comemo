    .github: add .md extension to SUPPORT file
    
    This makes GitHub render the markdown file automatically
    on their web UI.
    
    SUPPORT.md is the recommended file name according to the GitHub
    documentation:
    https://help.github.com/articles/adding-support-resources-to-your-project/
    
    Fixes #21223
