    go/build: reserve GOARCH values for all common architectures
    
    Whenever we introduce a new GOARCH, older Go releases won't
    recognize them and this causes trouble for both our users and
    us (we need to add unnecessary build tags).
    
    Go 1.5 has introduced three new GOARCHes so far: arm64 ppc64
    ppc64le, we can take the time to introduce GOARCHes for all
    common architectures that Go might support in the future to
    avoid the problem.
    
    Fixes #10165.
