    [dev.power64] runtime: fix early GC of Defer objects
    
    go_bootstrap was panicking during runtime initialization
    (under runtime.main) because Defer objects were being
    prematurely GC'd.  This happened because of an incorrect
    change to runtime·unrollgcprog_m to make it endian-agnostic
    during the conversion of runtime bitmaps to byte arrays.
