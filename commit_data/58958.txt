    internal/testenv: support the LUCI mobile builders in tests
    
    This change updates the testenv tests to correctly match on future LUCI
    builder names for mobile builders. This isn't a problem today because
    those haven't been set up yet, but the builder names are structured and
    it's clear where the modifiers will appear. Might as well set them up
    now.
