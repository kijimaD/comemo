    [dev.fuzz] cmd/go/internal/test: don't set default timeout when fuzzing
    
    The -timeout flag is not used when the fuzzing engine
    is running, but there was another backup alarm that would
    stop the test binary after 11 minutes by default. This
    change disables that backup alarm when the -fuzz flag is
    set.
    
    Note: unfortunately this means that if someone is running
    `go test -fuzz` and a test hangs before the fuzzing engine
    starts running, then the backup alarm won't trigger and
    the test will run ~forever. I don't think there's a way
    around this though, since the backup alarm has no way of
    knowing what stage of the test execution we're in (ie.
    are we running the unit tests, the seed corpus, or is
    it fuzzing).
    
    Fixes #44483
