    cmd/compile: remove unused code from typecheckdef
    
    typecheckdef used to be used to handle references to package-level
    declarations that hadn't yet been typechecked yet. It's no longer
    needed, as the current IR frontends construct package-level
    declarations with proper types upfront.
    
    Exception: this code is still used for compiler-generated function
    declarations, so that code needs to be kept. Eventually that code can
    be moved elsewhere, but for now this CL makes it obvious that the rest
    of the code paths really are unused.
    
    Updates #51691.
