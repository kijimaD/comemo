    archive/tar: skip TestSparseFiles on Plan 9
    
    CL 60871 added TestSparseFiles. This test is succeeding
    on Plan 9 when executed on the ramfs file system, but
    is failing when executed on the Fossil file system.
    
    This may be due to an issue in the handling of sparse
    files in the Fossil file system on Plan 9 that should
    be investigated.
    
    Updates #21977.
