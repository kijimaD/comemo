    cmd/link: fix size of filetab slice
    
    The linker writes the number of file symbols (Nhistfile) to the filetab slice
    and then Nhistfile offsets -- which means the slice contains Nhistfile+1
    entries, not just Nhistfile.
    
    I think this bug has been around since at least 1.4 but it's easier to trigger
    with shared libraries and a tiny binary that only has a couple of functions in
    it -- try go install -buildmode=shared std && go run -linkshared test/fixedbugs/issue4388.go.
