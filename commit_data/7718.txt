    syslog: split Unix domain support from network support.
    
    This is to make it easier to support Solaris syslog.  On
    Solaris syslog messages are sent via STREAMS using putmsg to
    /dev/conslog.  The putmsg call uses a a control buffer of type
    log_cdtl and a data buffer which is the message, and it is in
    general a big mess.  This CL just splits out the Unix domain
    support so that Solaris can use a different mechanism.  I do
    not propose to implement the Solaris support today.  This
    split will make it possible for gccgo to just call the libc
    function for now.
