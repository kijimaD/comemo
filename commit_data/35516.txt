    os: make MkdirAll support path in extended-length form
    
    Calling MkdirAll on paths in extended-length form (\\?\-prefixed)
    failed.
    
    MkdirAll calls itself recursively with parent directory of given path in
    its parameter. It finds parent directory by looking for delimiter in
    the path, and taking the left part. When path is in extended-length form,
    it finds empty path at the end.
    
    Here is a sample of path in extended-length form:
    \\?\c:\foo\bar
    
    This change fixes that by passing trailing path separator to MkdirAll (so
    it works for path like \\?\c:\).
    
    Fixes #22230
