    runtime: fix liveness issue in test-only getgcmask
    
    getgcmask stops referencing the object passed to it sometime between
    when the object is looked up and when the function returns. Notably,
    this can happen while the GC mask is actively being produced, and thus
    the GC might free the object.
    
    This is easily reproducible by adding a runtime.GC call at just the
    right place. Adding a KeepAlive on the heap-object path fixes it.
    
    Fixes #64188.
