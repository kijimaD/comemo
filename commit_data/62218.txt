    runtime: make TestSpuriousWakeupsNeverHangSemasleep more robust
    
    This change modifies this test (which involves an arbitrary timeout) to
    be a little less flaky by double-checking that our subprocess program
    completed even if the ticker fires and we've exceeded our timeout. The
    logic behind this change is that the testing goroutine might get delayed
    for any number of reasons, but the subprocess could still complete in
    time. Still, the goroutine will wake up to handle the ticker and see its
    over time, even though the event it was waiting for did actually happen.
    
    I can't reproduce #71548 locally, so I suspect because this test calls
    t.Parallel other load can delay the testing goroutine enough for this to
    happen (especially with GODEBUG=gccheckmark=1, which pauses
    everything to perform a full mark and sweep, and runtime tests love to
    call runtime.GC).
    
    For #71548.
