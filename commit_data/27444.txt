    cmd/asm: add s390x support
    
    s390x doesn't introduce any new assembly syntax. There are a few
    instructions which require the operands to be reordered, notably
    the storage-storage instructions that put the length into From3 so
    that the memory operands can be put into From and To.
    
    The assembly test currently covers a subset of instructions but
    tries to hit edge cases as much as possible. Unlike the other ports
    it can be linked as an executable to make disassembling it easy.
    It would be nice to autogenerate it at some point in the future.
