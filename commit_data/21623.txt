    [dev.cc] cmd/go: run C and Go assemblers side by side and verify matching output
    
    When an assembly file must be assembled, cmd/go now runs
    both (say) 6a and new6a and checks that they write identical
    output files.
    
    This serves as a build-time test that the new assemblers are accurate
    conversions of the old ones. As long as they are producing identical
    bytes, there's no need for run-time testing.
    
    Once the C conversion is done, we'll throw away the C code
    and this checking.
