    cmd/go: reapply doc change from CL 60590044.
    
    https://golang.org/cl/60590044 edited
    doc.go without editing the file it is generated from.
    The edit was lost at the next mkdoc.sh.
    Make the change in help.go and rerun mkdoc.sh.
    
    Pointed out in the review of CL 68580043.
