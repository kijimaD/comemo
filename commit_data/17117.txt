    encoding/csv: always allow trailing commas
    
    Original CL by rsc (11916045):
    
    The motivation for disallowing them was RFC 4180 saying
    "The last field in the record must not be followed by a comma."
    I believe this is an admonition to CSV generators, not readers.
    When reading, anything followed by a comma is not the last field.
    
    Fixes #5892.
