    strings: add special cases for Join of 2 and 3 strings
    
    We already had special cases for 0 and 1. Add 2 and 3 for now too.
    To be removed if the compiler is improved later (#6714).
    
    This halves the number of allocations and total bytes allocated via
    common filepath.Join calls, improving filepath.Walk performance.
    
    Noticed as part of investigating filepath.Walk in #16399.
