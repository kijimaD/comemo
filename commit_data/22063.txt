    cmd/internal/gc: mv builtins builtin
    
    This directory is processed by mkbuiltin.go and generates builtin.go.
    It should be named builtin too, not builtins, both for consistency
    and because file and directory names in general are singular unless
    forced otherwise.
    
    Commented on CL 6233 too.
