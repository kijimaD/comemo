    runtime: make new tests shorter in short mode
    We see timeouts in these tests on some platforms,
    but not on the others.  The hypothesis is that
    the problematic platforms are slow uniprocessors.
    Stack traces do not suggest that the process
    is completely hang, and it is able to schedule
    the alarm goroutine. And if it actually hangs,
    we still will be able to detect that.
