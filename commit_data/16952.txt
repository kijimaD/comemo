commit 98d94b589cfb03104c0bfd7d4e89b23b1d3ddf73
Author: Dmitriy Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>

    runtime: better debug output for inconsistent Note
    Update #5139.
    Double wakeup on Note was reported several times,
    but no reliable reproducer.
    There also was a strange report about weird value of epoll fd.
    Maybe it's corruption of global data...
