    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: changes to get identical output as new6a
    
    Fix up a couple of minor things pointed out in the last review.
    Also:
    
    1. If the symbol starts with center dot, prefix the name with "".
    2. If there is no locals size specified, use ArgsSizeUnknown (sic).
    3. Do not emit a history point at the start of a macro invocation,
    since we do not pop it at the end, behavior consistent with the
    old code.
    
    With these changes, old and new assemblers produce identical
    output at least for my simple test case, so that provides a verifiable
    check for future cleanups.
