    cmd/compile: in prove pass, check for unsat before adding local facts
    
    Local facts can get us to unsatisfiable because there is an
    unconditional panic in the block. That shouldn't declare the whole
    block as unreachable, because we do still need to enter it to get
    that panic.
    
    Fixes #68816
