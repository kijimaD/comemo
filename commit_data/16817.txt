    regexp: exclude exhaustive RE2 test from running under race detector.
    
    It is an expensive test to run, and even more so with -race,
    and causes timeouts on builders. It is doubtful that it would
    find a race that other tests in this package wouldn't, so there
    is little loss in excluding it.
    
    Update #5837.
