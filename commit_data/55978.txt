    net: mptcp: fallback to TCP in case of any error
    
    Specific MPTCP errors could happen but only one is detectable: if
    ENOPROTOOPT errno is returned, it likely means MPTCP has been disable
    via this sysctl knob: net.mptcp.enabled.
    
    But because MPTCP could be blocked by the administrator using different
    techniques (SELinux, etc.) making the socket creation returning other
    errors, it looks better to always retry to create a "plain" TCP socket
    when any errors are returned.
