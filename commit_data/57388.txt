    cmd/cgo/internal/testerrors: unskip TestPointerChecks on Windows
    
    All TestPointerChecks cases can be executed on Windows with some minor
    tweaks.
    
    It seems that the skip has been cargo-culted from when cgo error tests
    were first added in https://codereview.appspot.com/13498046.
