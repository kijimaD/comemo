    cmd/go: apply same per-package flags to compile and link of test
    
    If package strings has a particular set of gcflags, then the strings_test
    pseudo-package built as part of the test binary started inheriting the
    same flags in CL 81496, to fix #22831.
    
    Now the package main and final test binary link built as part of the
    strings test binary also inherit the same flags, to fix #22994.
    
    I am slightly uneasy about reusing package strings's flags for
    package main, but the alternative would be to introduce some
    kind of special case, which I'd be even more uneasy about.
    
    This interpretation preserves the Go 1.9 behavior of existing
    commands like:
    
            go test -c -ldflags=-X=mypkg.debugString=foo mypkg
    
    Fixes #22994.
