    net/http: make race detector happy for recently-added test
    
    Update #7264
    
    Races:
    http://build.golang.org/log/a2e401fdcd4903a61a3375bff5da702a20ddafad
    http://build.golang.org/log/ec4c69e92076a747ac6d5df7eb7b382b31ab3d43
    
    I think this is the first time I've actually seen a manifestation
    of Issue 7264, and one that I can reproduce.
    
    I don't know why it triggers on this test and not any others
    just like it, or why I can't reproduce Issue 7264
    independently, even when Dmitry gives me minimal repros.
    
    Work around it for now with some synchronization to make the
    race detector happy.
    
    The proper fix will probably be in net/http/httptest itself, not
    in all hundred some tests.
