    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: better scanner error messages
    
    This is one of several changes that were part of a larger rewrite
    which I made in early 2019 after switching to the new number literal
    syntax implementation. The purpose of the rewrite was to simplify
    reading of source code (Unicode character by character) and speed up
    the scanner but was never submitted for review due to other priorities.
    
    Part 2 of 3:
    
    This change contains improvements to the scanner error messages:
    
    - Use "rune literal" rather than "character literal" to match the
      spec nomenclature.
    
    - Shorter, more to the point error messages.
      (For instance, "more than one character in rune literal" rather
      than "invalid character literal (more than one character)", etc.)
