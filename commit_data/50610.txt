    runtime/pprof: disable GC during calibration test
    
    TestCPUProfileMultithreadMagnitude compares Go's CPU profile against the
    OS's accounting of the process's execution time, expecting them to be
    near equal. Background work from the runtime (especially in the garbage
    collector) can add significant noise to that measurement and flakiness
    to the test. Disable automatic GC cycles during the test.
