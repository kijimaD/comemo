    net/http: eliminate a goroutine leak in (*persistConn.addTLS)
    
    In case of a handshake timeout, the goroutine running addTLS
    closes the underlying connection, which should unblock the call
    to tlsConn.HandshakeContext. However, it didn't then wait for
    HandshakeContext to actually return.
    
    I thought this might have something to do with #57602, but as
    far as I can tell it does not. Still, it seems best to avoid the leak:
    if tracing is enabled we emit a TLSHandshakeDone event, and it seems
    misleading to produce that event when the handshake is still in
    progress.
    
    For #57602.
