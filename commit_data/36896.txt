    spec: distinguish between explicit and implicit conversions (clarification)
    
    The spec used the term "conversion" somewhat indiscriminately for
    explicit conversions that appear literally in the source, and implicit
    conversions that are implied by the context of an expression.
    Be clearer about it by defining the terms.
    
    Also, state that integer to string conversions of the form string(x)
    are never implicit. This clarifies situations where implicit conversions
    might require an integer to change to a string (but don't and never have
    done so). See line 3948.
    
    Fixes #26313.
