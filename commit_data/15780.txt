    go/build: allow ~ in middle of path, just not at beginning
    
    CL 7799045 relaxed the restriction in cmd/go on ~ in GOPATH
    to allow paths with ~ in the middle while continuing to
    protect against the common mistake of using GOPATH='~/home'
    instead of GOPATH=~/home.  Unfortunately go/build still
    filters these paths out:
    
            $ GOPATH=/tmp/test~ing go build
            test.go:22:2: cannot find package "test" in any of:
                    /usr/lib/go/test (from $GOROOT)
                    ($GOPATH not set)
    
    So relax the requirement in go/build, too.
