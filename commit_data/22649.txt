    runtime: improve comment about non-preemption during GC work
    
    Currently, gcDrainN is documented saying that it must be run on the
    system stack. In fact, the problem and solution here are somewhat
    subtler. First, it doesn't have to happen on the system stack, it just
    has to be non-stoppable (that is, non-preemptible). Second, this isn't
    specific to gcDrainN (though gcDrainN is perhaps the most surprising
    instance); it's general to anything that uses the gcWork structure.
    
    Move the comment to gcWork and generalize it.
