    cmd/compile: check for negative upper bound to IsSliceInBounds
    
    IsSliceInBounds(x, y) asserts that y is not negative, but
    there were cases where this is not true.  Change code
    generation to ensure that this is true when it's not obviously
    true.  Prove phase cleans a few of these out.
    
    With this change the compiler text section is 0.06% larger,
    that is, not very much.  Benchmarking still TBD, may need
    to wait for access to a benchmarking box (next week).
    
    Also corrected run.go to handle '?' in -update_errors output.
    
    Fixes #28797.
