    runtime: pass gcWork to markroot
    
    Currently markroot uses a gcWork on the stack and disposes of it
    immediately after marking one root. This used to be necessary because
    markroot was called from the depths of parfor, but now that we call it
    directly and have ready access to a gcWork at the call site, pass the
    gcWork in, use it directly in markroot, and share it across calls to
    markroot from the same P.
