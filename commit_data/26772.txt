    runtime: merge lfstack{Pack,Unpack} into one file
    
    Merge the remaining lfstack{Pack,Unpack} implemetations into one file.
    
    unsafe.Sizeof(uintptr(0)) == 4 is a constant comparison so this branch
    folds away at compile time.
    
    Dmitry confirmed that the upper 17 bits of an address will be zero for a
    user mode pointer, so there is no need to sign extend on amd64 during
    unpack, so we can reuse the same implementation as all othe 64 bit
    archs.
