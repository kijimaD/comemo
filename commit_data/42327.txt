    runtime: ready scavenger without next
    
    This change makes it so that waking up the scavenger readies its
    goroutine without "next" set, so that it doesn't interfere with the
    application's use of the runnext feature in the scheduler which helps
    fairness.
    
    As of CL 201763 the scavenger began waking up much more often, and in
    TestPingPongHog this meant that it would sometimes supercede either a
    hog or light goroutine in runnext, leading to a skew in the results and
    ultimately a test flake.
    
    This change thus re-enables the TestPingPongHog test on the builders.
    
    Fixes #35271.
