    cmd/go,cmd/cgo: in _cgo_flags use one line per flag
    
    The flags that we recorded in _cgo_flags did not use any quoting,
    so a flag containing embedded spaces was mishandled.
    Change the _cgo_flags format to put each flag on a separate line.
    That is a simple format that does not require any quoting.
    
    As far as I can tell only cmd/go uses _cgo_flags, and it is only
    used for gccgo. If this patch doesn't cause any trouble, then
    in the next release we can change to only using _cgo_flags for gccgo.
    
    Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.
    
    Fixes #60306
    Fixes CVE-2023-29405
