    cmd/go: define an asm macro for GOEXPERIMENT=regabi
    
    This defines a macro for the regabi GOEXPERIMENT when assembling
    runtime assembly code.
    
    In general, assembly code will be shielded from the calling convention
    change, but there is a small amount of runtime assembly that is going
    to have to change. By defining a macro, we can easily make the small
    necessary changes. The other option is to use build tags, but that
    would require duplicating nontrivial amounts of unaffected code,
    leading to potential divergence issues. (And unlike Go code, assembly
    code can't depend on the compiler optimizing away branches on a
    feature constant.) We consider the macro preferable, especially since
    this is expected to be temporary as we transition to the new calling
    convention.
    
    Updates #40724.
