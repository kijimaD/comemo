    And:
    
    Add CL Sung (Individual CLA), but where gerrit is using personal email
    address with CLA signed, but the git commit itself is using an
    unverified htc.com address. The commit is:
        https://github.com/golang/oauth2/commit/099e4f0
    For github user https://github.com/clsung which says "Self-Employed"
    and "clsung@gmail.com". Perhaps the self-employed part is new
    since Sep 10, 2014.
