    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: fix failed lowerings
    
    One was OAPPEND of large types.  We need to mem-mem copy them
    instead of storing them.
    
    Another was pointer-like struct and array types being put in the
    data field of an eface.  We need to use the underlying pointer
    type for the load that fills in the eface.data field.
