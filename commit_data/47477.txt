    runtime: fix bogus NtCurrentTeb()->TlsSlots[n] calculation on windows/arm64
    
    runtime.save_g adds X18 to runtime.tls_g in order to have a pointer to
    thread local storage. X18 represents a pointer to the TEB on ARM64 and
    runtime.tls_g is set in runtime.wintls at initialization time. This
    function calls TlsAlloc to allocate a "TLS slot", which is supposed to
    index into NtCurrentTeb()->TlsSlots. So the full calculation we want is:
    
        X18 + offsetof(TEB, TlsSlots) + 8*TlsAllocReturnValue
    
    It makes sense to store the complete value of "offsetof(TEB,
    TlsSlots) + TlsAllocReturnValue" into runtime.tls_g so that the
    calculation can simplify to:
    
        X18 + runtime.tls_g
    
    But, instead of computing that, we're currently doing something kind of
    strange, in which we:
    
        - call TlsAlloc, which puts its return value into X0
        - make sure X0 is less than 64, so we don't overflow
        - set runtime.tls_g to 8*X1 + offsetof(TEB, TlsSlots)
    
    The question is: why are we using X1 instead of X0? What is in X1?
    
    Probably it was, by luck, zero before, and TlsAlloc returned zero, so
    there was no problem. But on recent versions of Windows, X1 is some
    other garbage value and not zero, so we eventually crash when trying to
    dereference X18 + runtime.tls_g.
    
    This commit fixes the problem by just computing:
    
       runtime.tls_g = 8*X0 + offsetof(TEB, TlsSlots)
    
    Fixes #45138.
