    crypto: reorg, cleanup and add function for generating CRLs.
    
    This change moves a number of common PKIX structures into
    crypto/x509/pkix, from where x509, and ocsp can reference
    them, saving duplication. It also removes x509/crl and merges it into
    x509 and x509/pkix.
    
    x509 is changed to take advantage of the big.Int support that now
    exists in asn1. Because of this, the public/private key pair in
    http/httptest/server.go had to be updated because it was serialised
    with an old version of the code that didn't zero pad ASN.1 INTEGERs.
