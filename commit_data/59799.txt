    cmd/compile: bail PGO method lookup on interface types
    
    Interface types don't have concrete method implementations, so it does
    not make sense to attempt a lookup.
    
    An interface method would not normally appear in a PGO profile as it has
    no symbol in the final binary. However it can appear if the method was
    concrete when the profile was collected and it has since been refactored
    to an interface method in the code being compiled.
    
    The guards here (OTYPE, !Alias, !IsInterface) now match
    noder.linker.relocObj, which does a similar iteration of all methods.
    
    Fixes #67016.
