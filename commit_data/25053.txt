    runtime: avoid debug prints of huge objects
    
    Currently when the GC prints an object for debugging (e.g., for a
    failed invalidptr or checkmark check), it dumps the entire object. To
    avoid inundating the user with output for really large objects, limit
    this to printing just the first 128 words (which are most likely to be
    useful in identifying the type of an object) and the 32 words around
    the problematic field.
