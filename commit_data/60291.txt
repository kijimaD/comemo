    time: add to format documentation about dangers of using RFC1123{,Z} for parsing
    
    When using time.RFC1123Z to parse the date header value out of an email,
    an error is returned for dates that occur in the first 9 days of a
    month. This is because the format strings for RFC 1123 defined in the
    time package indicate that the day should be prefixed with a leading 0.
    
    Reading the spec, the line that talks about it seems to indicate that
    days can be either 1 or 2 digits:
    
      `date = 1*2DIGIT month 2*4DIGIT`
    
    So a date header with a day like `7` with no leading zero should be
    accepted.
    
    Fixes #67887
