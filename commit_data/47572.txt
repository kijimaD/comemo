    misc/cgo/test: remove unnecessary forward declaration
    
    This test otherwise fails to build on windows/arm64 as of CL 364774
    due to a warning (promoted to an error) about a mismatched dllexport
    attribute. Fortunately, it seems not to need the forward-declared
    function in this file anyway.
