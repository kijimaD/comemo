    [dev.power64] runtime: match argument/return type signedness in power64x assembly
    
    Previously, the power64x runtime assembly was sloppy about
    using sign-extending versus zero-extending moves of arguments
    and return values.  I think all of the cases that actually
    mattered have been fixed in recent CLs; this CL fixes up the
    few remaining mismatches.
