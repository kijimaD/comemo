    runtime: remove pointless harvestwbufs
    
    Currently we harvestwbufs the moment we enter the mark phase, even
    before starting the world again. Since cached wbufs are only filled
    when we're in mark or mark termination, they should all be empty at
    this point, making the harvest pointless. Remove the harvest.
    
    We should, but do not currently harvest at the end of the mark phase
    when we're running out of work to do.
