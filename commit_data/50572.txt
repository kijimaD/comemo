    cmd/go: omit VCS stamping during bootstrap
    
    cmd/dist can't easily hard-code -buildvcs=false because not all
    versions of cmd/go supported for bootstrapping recognize that flag.
    
    However, we don't want to stamp the bootstrap binaries: the stamping
    is redundant with the VERSION file writted during bootstrapping (which
    is why it is normally omitted for standard-library packages and
    commands), and it may also interfere with building the Go repo from a
    source tarball or zip file.
    
    Fixes #54852.
