commit 8b67cf0bc6ad657fddcbaaa10729d0086f08f9a9

    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: pass obj.As to oaddi rather than an instruction
    
    This simplifies callers, as they do not need to call opirr before calling oaddi.
    Additionally, use appropriate types (int16) for registers, which avoids the need
    to continually cast.
