commit 6482fe6c65f105d2177b6278c97d464bc0976ca3
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 14 16:41:39 2015 -0500

    runtime: delete dead code called from C.
    
    printf, vprintf, snprintf, gc_m_ptr, gc_g_ptr, gc_itab_ptr, gc_unixnanotime.
    
    These were called from C.
    There is no more C.
    
    Now that vprintf is gone, delete roundup, which is unsafe (see CL 2814).
