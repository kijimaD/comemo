    path/filepath: document and test behavior of SkipDir on files
    
    This behavior is not what we might have designed from the start,
    but it has been present since Go 1. Rather than make a visible
    behavioral change that might cause programs to work differently
    in Go ≤1.4 vs Go ≥1.5, document what SkipDir on a non-directory
    has always meant. If code doesn't want this meaning, it is easy
    enough not to return SkipDir on non-directories.
    
    Fixes #10533.
