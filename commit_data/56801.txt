    cmd/go: fix handling of builtin packages in WriteCoverMetaFilesFile
    
    In certain unusual situations we can wind up with a build action for a
    dummy (built-in) package as a dependency for the writeCoverMeta
    pseudo-action generated when -coverpkg is in effect; this was causing
    a panic in WriteCoverMetaFilesFile when it discovered a predecessor
    whose Mode field was not "build". Update the code that constructs deps
    for writeCoverMeta action to skip dummy builds.
    
    Fixes #67953.
