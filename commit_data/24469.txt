    sync/atomic: reenable TestNilDeref everywhere
    
    There is absolutely no information about how this was failing.
    If we reenable the test then at least we can get a build log from
    darwin/arm.
    
    There are not even freebsd/arm or netbsd/arm builders,
    so not too worried about those. (That is another problem.)
