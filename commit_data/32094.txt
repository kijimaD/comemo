    testsanitizers: check that tsan program runs, skip tsan10 on gcc
    
    Check not only that a tsan program can be built, but also that it runs.
    This fails with some installations of GCC 7.
    
    Skip the tsan10 program when using GCC, as it reportedly hangs.
    
    This is a patch to help people build 1.9; we may be able to do a
    better fix for 1.10.
    
    Updates #21196
