    text/template: revert minor change to Name method
    For  better printing, I recently changed Name to return "<unnamed>" for templates
    with empty names, but this causes trouble for the many packages that used "" as
    the template name, so restore the old behavior.
    It's usually printed as a quoted string anyway, so it should be fine.
