    cmd/gofmt: remove -tabwidth and -tabs flags
    
    Having these flags misleads people into thinking they're acceptable
    for code that "must be gofmt'd".
    
    If an organization wishes to use gofmt internally with
    different settings, they can fork gofmt trivially. But "gofmt"
    as used by the community with open source Go code should not
    support these old knobs.
    
    Also removes the -comments flag.
    
    Fixes #7101
