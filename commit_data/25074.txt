    cmd/cover: allow part selection to be retained across page refreshes
    
    Usually, you are primarily interested to see the coverage of a particular
    file (e.g. when you're changing tests that affects a given source file),
    it is very valuable if you can just refresh the page and immediately see
    changes to the part you're already looking at (without selecting from the
    selector again.)
