    doc/effectivego: reword confusing sentence
    
    For some reason git won't let me write
    
            doc/effective_go.html: reword confusing sentence
    
    or even
    
            doc/effective_go: reword confusing sentence
    
    as the subject line for this CL, but that's not important. The
    actual CL just rewrites one sentence and adds an option to grep in
    the associated example.
    
    Fixes #15875

 Imagine you couldn't remember the name "Compile" but were looking for
 the parsing function for regular expressions, so you ran
 the command,

-$ godoc regexp | grep parse
