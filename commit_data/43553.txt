    [dev.link] cmd/link: convert inltree syms to anonymous in pclntab
    
    The pclntab phase generates a series of "inltree.*" symbols with
    inlining related pcdata; these symbols previously were given names and
    enterered into the symbol lookup table, but there is no real reason to
    do this, since they never need to be looked up when pcln generation is
    done. Switch them over to anonymous symbols.
    
    So as to insure that the later symtab phase picks them up correctly,
    assign them a type of SGOFUNC instead of SRODATA, and change symtab to
    look for this when assigning symbols to groups.
