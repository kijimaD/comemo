    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: reorganize ir/fmt.go
    
    This code is a few layer of abstraction stacked up on top
    of each other, and they're hard to see all at the same time
    because the file is pretty mixed up. As much as I try to avoid
    code rearrangement to keep history, this one is long overdue.
    
    A followup CL will cut out some of the layers, and the diff will be
    much clearer what's going on with the code ordered with
    callers near callees, as it is now.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
