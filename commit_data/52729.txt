    runtime, cmd: rationalize StackLimit and StackGuard
    
    The current definitions of StackLimit and StackGuard only indirectly
    specify the NOSPLIT stack limit and duplicate a literal constant
    (928). Currently, they define the stack guard delta, and from there
    compute the NOSPLIT limit.
    
    Rationalize these by defining a new constant, abi.StackNosplitBase,
    which consolidates and directly specifies the NOSPLIT stack limit (in
    the default case). From this we then compute the stack guard delta,
    inverting the relationship between these two constants. While we're
    here, we rename StackLimit to StackNosplit to make it clearer what's
    being limited.
    
    This change does not affect the values of these constants in the
    default configuration. It does slightly change how
    StackGuardMultiplier values other than 1 affect the constants, but
    this multiplier is a pretty rough heuristic anyway.

    For #59670.
