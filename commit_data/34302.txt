    cmd/compile/internal: use sparseSet, optimize isSynthetic
    
    changedVars was functionally a set, but couldn't be iterated over
    efficiently. In functions with many variables, the wasted iteration was
    costly. Use a sparseSet instead.
    
    (*gc.Node).String() is very expensive: it calls Sprintf, which does
    reflection, etc, etc. Instead, just look at .Sym.Name, which is all we
    care about.
