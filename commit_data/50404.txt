    testing: skip extra -count iterations if there are no tests
    
    When running benchmarks with high -count and no tests (either at all or
    filtered with -run), the time for runTests to check for tests -count
    times can add a significant delay to starting benchmarks.
    
    To avoid this delay, make runTests bail out on the second iteration if
    the first found no tests to run. We expect the same tests to run every
    time, so there is no reason to duplicate work.
    
    One caveat: the testing docs do not explicitly require the same subtests
    to be run on every call, so this could break tests that depend on
    multiple runs to actually run all tests. I consider such tests invalid,
    but some may exist.
    
    Fixes #49050
