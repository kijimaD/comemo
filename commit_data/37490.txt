    cmd/go/internal/imports: resolve symlinks in ScanDir
    
    We were using the mode reported by ReadDir to decide whether each
    entry is a file, but in the case of symlinks that isn't sufficient: a
    symlink could point to either a file or a directory, and if it is a
    file we should treat it as such.
    
    Fixes #28107
