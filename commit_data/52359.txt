    cmd/go: extend the linker -o workaround for plugins to all platforms
    
    On Linux, for a shared object, at least with the Gold linker, the
    output file path is recorded in the .gnu.version_d section. When
    the output file path is in a temporary directory, it causes
    nondeterministic build.
    
    This is similar to #58557, but for Linux with the Gold linker.
    Apply the same workaround as in CL 477296.
    
    Should fix the linux-arm64-longtest builder.
