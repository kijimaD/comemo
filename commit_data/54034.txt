    cmd/api: rename api.go to main_test.go
    
    This makes cmd/api no longer an importable package.
    In CL 453258 I forgot that there was no direct prohibition
    on importing packages from cmd - we just rely on the
    fact that cmd/* is all package main and everything else
    is cmd/internal.
    
    Fixes #62069.
