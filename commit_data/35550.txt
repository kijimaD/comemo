    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: don't store block start states
    
    Keeping the start state of each block around costs more than just
    recomputing them as necessary, especially because many blocks only have
    one predecessor and don't need any merging at all. Stop storing the
    start state, and reuse predecessors' end states as much as conveniently
    possible.
