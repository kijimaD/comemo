commit 36ca5fde680faf1abd4b05b4ca1b96c488fcbdb8
Author: Austin Clements <aclements@csail.mit.edu>

    Implement labels, goto, labeled break, and labeled continue.
    Return checking is now done as a general flow check at the end
    of function compilation, since break and goto complicated the
    way I was doing return checking before.  Goto-over-declaration
    checking is also done as a final flow check.
    
    Temporary variables used for effect extraction are now
    actually temporary.  Otherwise "op=", "++", and "--" appear as
    declarations that cannot be jumped over.
