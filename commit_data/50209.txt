    cmd/asm: fix condition check to work on ppc64
    
    A condition check was added to parse.go in CL 405542 to prevent
    usage of scaled operands on ppc64. However while trying to improve
    the error notification message, an if-condition was left out by
    oversight. This CL corrects that.
