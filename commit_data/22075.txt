    [dev.cc] cmd/go: fix expansion of 'std', add 'cmd'
    
    The wildcard 'std' is defined in documentation to be all the packages
    in the Go standard library. It has also historically matched commands
    in the main repo, but as we implement core commands in Go, that
    becomes problematic. We need a wildcard that means just the library,
    and since 'std' is already documented to have that definition, make it so.
    
    Add a new wildcard 'cmd' for the commands in the main repo ($GOROOT).
    Commands that want both can say 'std cmd' (or 'cmd std') to get the
    effect of the old 'std'.
    
    Update make.bash etc to say both std and cmd most of the time.
    
    Exception: in race.bash, do not install race-enabled versions of
    the actual commands. This avoids trying to write binaries while
    using them, but more importantly it avoids enabling the race
    detector and its associated memory overhead for the already
    memory-hungry compilers.
