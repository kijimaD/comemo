    cmd/go: add a regression test for package import cycles guarded by build tags
    
    I've been thinking about the relationship between the package import
    graph and the module import graph, and realized that the package
    import graph is not always acyclic. (The package import graph must be
    acyclic given a specific set of build tags, but the 'mod' subcommands
    intentionally ignore build tags.)
    
    I'm not sure whether we have any existing regression tests that cover
    this sort of cycle, so I'm adding one now. Thankfully, it passes!
    
    Updates #36460
