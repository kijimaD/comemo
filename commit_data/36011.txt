    cmd/go: handle relative temp dir
    
    Most programs seem to accept a relative temp dir, as weird as that might be.
    
    Also, the meaning of relative is a little more fluid on Windows:
    TMP=\temp is relative (to the current drive) but will work well enough.
    
    Also, Windows GetTempPath automatically converts a relative
    %TMP% into an absolute path, so we'd be imposing different
    behavior for GOTMPDIR vs TMP.
    
    It seems easier and more consistent to just impose the obvious
    meaning than to add an error we can only implement some of
    the time.
    
    Originally got here because "cmd/go:" should be"go:" in error message,
    but the error message is gone now.
    
    Fixes #23264.
