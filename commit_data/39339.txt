    cmd/dist: build exec wrappers during bootstrap
    
    The androidtest.bash script encodes the additional steps to build
    Go and run tests on Android. In order to add sharded builders and
    trybots, Android needs to fit into the usual make.bash + cmd/dist test
    pattern.
    
    This change moves building the exec wrapper into cmd/dist bootstrap.
    
    Do the same for iOS while we're here.
    
    Updates #23824
