    net: fix close on closed listener on Plan 9
    
    Since close errors have been cleaned up in CL 39997,
    TestCloseError is failing on Plan 9, because
    TCPListener.Close didn't check that the listener
    has already been closed before writing the "hangup"
    string to the listener control file.
    
    This change fixes TCPListener.Close on Plan 9,
    by closing poll.FD before writing the "hangup"
    string.
    
    Fixes #20128.
