    go/types: remove work-around for issue #26390
    
    This work-around is not needed anymore now that method
    signatures are type-checked separately from their receiver
    base types: no artificial cycles are introduced anymore
    and so there is no need to artificially cut them.
    
    Fixes #26854.
