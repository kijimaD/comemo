    encoding/csv: restore Go 1.9 quoted \r\n handling in Reader
    
    CL 52810 changed Reader to interpret a quoted \r\n as a raw \r\n
    when reading fields. This seems likely to break existing users, and
    discussion on both #21201 (the original issue that triggered the change)
    and #22746 (discussing whether to revert the change) failed to identify
    a single motivating example for this change. To avoid breaking existing
    users for no clear reason, revert the change.
    
    The Reader has been rewritten in the interim so this is not a git revert
    but instead and adjustment (and slight simplification) of the new Reader.
    
    Fixes #22746.
