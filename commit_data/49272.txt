    runtime: allow arm64 SEH to be called if illegal instruction
    
    DLLs built with recent Microsoft toolchains for ARM64 test for ARMv8.1
    atomics by potentially calling an illegal instruction, and then trapping
    the exception to disable use of them by way of a structured exception
    handler. However, vectored exception handlers are always called before
    structured exception handlers. When LoadLibrary-ing DLLs that do this
    probing during initialization, our lastcontinuehandler winds up being
    called, and then crashing, but actually it should give execution back to
    the library to handle the exception and fix up the state. So special
    case this for arm64 with illegal instructions, and hope that we're not
    masking other things in external DLLs that might more fatally trigger an
    illegal instruction exception.
    
    Updates #47576.
