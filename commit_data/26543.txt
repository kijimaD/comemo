    cmd/compile: clear OTFUNC info when converting to OTYPE
    
    I want to get rid of OTFUNC, which serves no useful purpose.  However,
    it turns out that the escape analysis pass looks at the node slices set
    up for OTFUNC, even though by the time escape analysis runs the OTFUNC
    has been converted to OTYPE.  This CL converts the escape analysis code
    to look at the function decls instead, and clears the OTFUNC info when
    converting to OTYPE to ensure that nothing else looks at it.
