    cmd/compile/internal/types: change NewNamed to use TypeObject
    
    Semantically, TypeObject is the interface that go/types.TypeName would
    implement, so we might as well use that instead of the more generic
    Object (analog to go/types.Object) for NewNamed. In practice, this
    doesn't really matter though, because we use *ir.Name for almost all
    Objects anyway.
    
    Also, remove VarObject: its last use was removed in CL 302071 (March
    2021).
