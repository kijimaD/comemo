    cmd/vendor: cherry pick asm_linux_riscv64.s for x/sys/unix
    
    Manually cherry pick asm_linux_riscv64.s from x/sys/unix rev 4c3a92842,
    as needed for the linux/riscv64 port.
    
    Normally this would be a vendor update, however this is significantly
    more risky at this point in time - a full update can be done post release.
    
    Updates #27532
