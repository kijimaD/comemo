    runtime: flush mcaches to mcentral before reading memstats
    
    Currently mcaches are flushed to mcentral after a bunch of memstats have
    already been read. This is not safe (in the sense that it doesn't ensure
    consisent memstats) since memstats may in general change when mcentral
    data structures are manipulated.
    
    Note that prior to the new mcentral implementation this was not a
    problem because mcentral operations happened to never modify certain
    memstats. As of the new mcentral implementation, we might for example
    persistentalloc when uncaching a span, which would change memstats. This
    can cause a skew between the value of sys (which currently is calculated
    before mcaches are flushed) and the value of gc_sys and other_sys.
    
    Fix this by moving mcache flushing to the very top of updatememstats.
    Also leave a comment explaining that this must be done first, in
    general, because mcentrals make no guarantee that they will not
    influence memstats (and doing so would be unnecessarily restrictive).
    
    Fixes #38712.
