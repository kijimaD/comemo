    cmd/compile: add newnamel, use in tempAt
    
    newnamel is newname but with no dependency on lineno or Curfn.
    This makes it suitable for use in a concurrent back end.
    Use it now to make tempAt global-free.
    
    The decision to push the assignment to n.Name.Curfn
    to the caller of newnamel is based on mdempsky's
    comments in #19683 that he'd like to do that
    for callers of newname as well.
    
    Passes toolstash-check. No compiler performance impact.
    
    Updates #19683
    Updates #15756
