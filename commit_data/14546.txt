commit cc3f21cefeb24c214487d89ebe50818c08e37d88
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    spec: channel operations are restricted by the channel direction
    
    Also:
    - 'for' statements with a range clause do not accept send-only
       channels
    - '_, _ = range ch' is not equivalent to "_ = range ch" if ch
       is a channel (rewriting the latter to the former leads to
       an invalid range clause).
    
    These clarifications document the status quo.
