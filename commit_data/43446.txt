    cmd/compile: refactor around HTMLWriter removing logger in favor of Func
    
    Replace HTMLWriter's Logger field with a *Func. Implement Fatalf method
    for HTMLWriter which gets the Frontend() from the Func and calls down
    into it's Fatalf method, passing the msg and args along. Replace
    remaining calls to the old Logger with calls to logging methods on
    the Func.
