    [dev.fuzz] cmd/go: fix test_fuzz_cache
    
    This test started failing when coverage-based fuzzing was enabled.
    It expects at least one file to be written to the fuzz cache. Nothing
    was written because the fuzz function was trivial, and no interesting
    inputs could be discovered.
    
    This CL makes the fuzz function return different values for different
    inputs, which is enough to pass.
