    net: disable Windows netsh tests when netsh won't run
    
    On my Surface Pro X running the insider preview,
    running "netsh help" from Powershell started from the task bar works.
    But running "powershell" at a cmd.exe prompt and then running
    "netsh help" produces missing DLL errors.
    These aren't our fault, so just skip the netsh-based tests if this happens.
