    syscall: introduce SysProcAttr.ParentProcess on Windows
    
    This allows users to specify which process should be used as the parent
    process when creating a new process.
    
    Note that this doesn't just trivially pass the handle onward to
    PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS, because inherited handles must be
    valid in the parent process, so if we're changing the destination
    process, then we must also change the origin of the parent handles. And,
    the StartProcess function must clean up these handles successfully when
    exiting, regardless of where the duplication happened. So, we take care
    in this commit to use DuplicateHandle for both duplicating and for
    closing the inherited handles.
    
    The test was taken originally from CL 288272 and adjusted for use here.
    
    Fixes #44011.
