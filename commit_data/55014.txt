    runtime: print g pointer in crash stack dump
    
    When debugging a runtime crash with a stack trace, sometimes we
    have the g pointer in some places (e.g. as an argument of a
    traceback function), but the g's goid in some other places (the
    stack trace of that goroutine), which are usually not easy to
    match up. This CL makes it print the g pointer. This is only
    printed in crash mode, so it doesn't change the usual user stack
    trace.
