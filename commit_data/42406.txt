    doc: remove expiration from PGP key in security.html
    
    The key had expired earlier this year. Simply resigned it with no
    expiration, so it maintains the same fingerprint.
    
    Removed the encouragement to use PGP above the fold. We trust the
    security of our mail system, so it's really only there for people that
    want it.
    
    Also removed the individual keys, as they were never used, and both Adam
    and I have access to the security@golang.org key anyway.
