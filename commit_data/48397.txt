    time: rewrite the documentation for layout strings
    
    People continue to be confused by how these work. Address that by some
    rejiggering.
    
    Introduce a constant called Layout that both defines the time and
    provides a reference point for Parse and Format to refer to. We can
    then delete much redundancy, especially for Format's comments, but
    Parse tightens a bit too.
    
    Then change the way the concept of the layout string is introduced,
    and provide a clearer catalog of what its elements are.
    
    Fixes #38871
