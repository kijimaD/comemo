    [dev.typeparams] runtime: allow newproc split stack
    
    newproc was not allowed to split stack because it had a special
    stack layout, where the go'd function's arguments were passed on
    stack but not included in the signature (therefore the stack map).
    Now it no longer has argument, so it does not need to be nosplit.
