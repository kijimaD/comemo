    exp/locale/collate: implementation of tailorings and table generation.
    Tailorings are represented by removing and reinserting entries from a linked list.
    After all tailorings are done, missing weights are computed and verified.
    This implementation assumes that entries that are used in expansions are not
    reinserted at a later point.  This considerably simplifies the implementation.
