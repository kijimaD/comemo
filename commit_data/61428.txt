    cmd/asm: use single-instruction forms for all loong64 sign and zero extensions
    
    8-bit and 16-bit sign extensions and 32-bit zero extensions were realized
    with left and right shifts before this change. We now support assembling
    EXTWB, EXTWH and BSTRPICKV, so all three can be done with a single insn
    respectively.
    
    This patch is a copy of CL 479496.
