    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile/internal/types2: don't report two errors for bad strings
    
    If the parser reported an error for (string) literals, don't report
    a second error during type checking.
    
    This should have a couple of tests but they are tricky to arrange
    with the current testing framework as the ERROR comment cannot be
    on the line where the string. But the change is straightforward
    and we have test/fixedbugs/issue32133.go that is passing now.
