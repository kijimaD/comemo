    cmd/go: improve handling of os.DevNull on Windows
    
    The "go test" and "go build" commands have special-case behavior when
    passed "-o /dev/null". These checks are case-sensitive and assume that
    os.DevNull is an absolute path. Windows filesystems are case-insensitive
    and os.DevNull is NUL, which is not an absolute path.
    
    CL 145220 changed filepath.IsAbs to report "NUL" as absolute to work
    around this issue; that change is being rolled back and a better fix here
    is to compare the value of -o against os.DevNull before attempting to
    merge it with a base path. Make that fix.
    
    On Windows, accept any capitilization of "NUL" as the null device.
    
    This change doesn't cover every possible name for the null device, such
    as "-o //./NUL", but this test is for efficiency rather than correctness.
    Accepting just the most common name is fine.
    
    For #56217.
