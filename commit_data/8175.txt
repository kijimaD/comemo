    net: try /etc/hosts before loading DNS config.
    
    On Mac X 10.6 /etc/resolv.conf is changed dynamically,
    and may not exist at all when all network connections
    are turned off, thus any lookup, even for "localhost"
    would fail with "error reading DNS config: open
    /etc/resolv.conf: no such file or directory". This
    change avoids the error by trying to lookup addresses
    in /etc/hosts before loading DNS config.
