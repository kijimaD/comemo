commit adc19ac5e3fc4914df4b09400686c964e379532b

    exp/locale/collate: adjusted contraction trie to support Myanmar (Burmese),
    which has a rather large contraction table. The value of the next state
    offset now starts after the current block, instead of before.  This is
    slightly less efficient (on extra addition per state change), but gives
    some extra range for the offsets.
    Also introduced constants for final (0) and noIndex (0xFF).
    tables.go is updated in a separate CL.
