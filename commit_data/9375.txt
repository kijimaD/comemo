    errchk: allow multiple patterns
    
    // ERROR "pattern1" "pattern2"
    
    means that there has to be one or more
    lines matching pattern1 and then excluding
    those, there have to be one or more lines
    matching pattern2.  So if you expect two
    different error messages from a particular
    line, writing two separate patterns checks
    that both errors are produced.
    
    Also, errchk now flags lines that produce
    more errors than expected.  Before, as long as
    at least one error matched the pattern, all the
    others were ignored.
    
    Revise tests to expect or silence these
    additional errors.
