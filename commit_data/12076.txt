    strconv: run garbage collection before counting allocations in test
    
    My theory is that the call to f() allocates, which triggers
    a garbage collection, which itself may do some allocation,
    which is being counted.  Running a garbage collection
    before starting the test should avoid this problem.
    
    Fixes #2894 (I hope).
