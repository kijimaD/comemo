    net: add (*Resolver).LookupIP
    
    Previously, looking up only IPv4 or IPv6 addresses was only possible
    with DefaultResolver via ResolveIPAddr. Add this functionality to the
    Resolver type with a new method, LookupIP. This largely brings Resolver
    functionally to parity with the global functions. The name LookupIP is
    used over ResolveIPAddr to be consistent with the other Resolver
    methods.
    
    There are two main benefits to (*Resolver).LookupIP over
    (*Resolver).LookupHost. First is an ergonomic benefit. Wanting a
    specific family of address is common enough to justify a method, evident
    by the existence of ResolveIPAddr. Second, this opens the possibility of
    not performing unnecessary DNS requests when only a specific family of
    addresses are needed. This optimization is left to follow up work.
