    runtime: add "max waste" column to size class table comment
    
    This computes the maximum possible waste in a size class due to both
    internal and external fragmentation as a percent of the span size.
    This parallels the reasoning about overhead in the comment at the top
    of mksizeclasses.go and confirms that comment's assertion that (except
    for the few smallest size classes), none of the size classes have
    worst-case internal and external fragmentation simultaneously.
