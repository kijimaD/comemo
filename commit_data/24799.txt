    net: Increase the acceptable delay in TestDialerDualstack
    
    This may fix the flakiness on Windows/x64, assuming that it's actually
    due to a variance in the connection time which slightly exceeds 100ms.
    
    150ms + 95ms = 245ms, which is still low enough to avoid triggering
    Happy Eyeballs (300ms) on non-Windows platforms.
