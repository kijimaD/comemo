    net: revise IP.String result for malformed IP address to add ? back
    
    In earlier versions of Go the result was simply "?".
    A change in this cycle made the result echo back the hex bytes
    of the address, which is certainly useful, but now the result is
    not clearly indicating an error. Put the "?" back, at the beginning
    of the hex string, to make the invalidity of the string clearer.
