    cmd/asm,cmd/dist,cmd/go: remove asm -compiling-runtime flag
    
    Currently, dist and go pass a -compiling-runtime flag to asm if
    they're compiling a runtime package. However, now that we always pass
    the package path to asm, it can make that determination just as well
    as its callers can. This CL moves that check into asm and drops the
    flag.
    
    This in turn makes dist's copy of IsRuntimePackagePath unnecessary, so
    we delete it.
