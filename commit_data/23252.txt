    text/template/parse: huge integers are not floats
    
    Ideal constants in the template package are a little different from Go.
    This is a case that slipped through the cracks: A huge integer number
    was accepted as a floating-point number, but this loses precision
    and is confusing. Also, the code in the template package (as opposed
    to the parse package) wasn't expecting it.
    
    Root this out at the source: If an integer doesn't fit an int64 or uint64,
    complain right away.
