    cmd/compile: seed rand with time when race enabled
    
    When the race detector is enabled,
    the compiler randomizes the order in which functions are compiled,
    in an attempt to shake out bugs.
    But we never re-seed the rand source, so every execution is identical.
    Fix that to get more coverage.
