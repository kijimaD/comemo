    bufio: test for exact error value in TestNegativeEOFReader and TestLargeReader
    
    CL 225357 added tests for Scanner not panicking on bad readers.
    CL 225557 created a named error value that is returned instead.
    CL 237739 documents that the bufio.ErrBadReadCount is returned
    when bufio.Scanner is used with an invalid io.Reader.
    
    This suggests we wouldn't want that behavior to be able to change
    without a test noticing it, so modify the tests to check for the
    exact error value instead of just any non-nil one.
    
    For #38053.
