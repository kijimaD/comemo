    [dev.link] cmd/compile: pass index through when re-exporting
    
    When we re-export an imported symbol that has an index, we should
    pass the index through. Currently, if the symbol is not
    referenced in the generated machine code, it does not get
    assigned a package index, and the exporter will not export its
    symbol index. Let the exporter handle this case -- if the symbol
    has a symbol index but not a package index, still export its
    symbol index. This is safe as referenced-by-name symbols always
    have their package indices set to a special value.
    
    This should reduce the number of referenced-by-name symbols, and
    also make the export data more stable, less dependent on codegen
    details.
