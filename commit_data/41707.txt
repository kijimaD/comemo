    [dev.link] cmd/link: do not put static symbols into name lookup table
    
    Since the previous CL, we will not reference static symbols by
    name. Therefore no need to put them into the name lookup table.
    
    On Linux/ARM, in runtime/internal/atomic/sys_linux_arm.s, the
    kernelcas function has a definition and a reference written in
    two different forms, one with package prefix, one without. This
    way, the assembler cannot know they are the same symbol, only the
    linker knows. This is quite unusual, unify the names to so the
    assembler can resolve it to index.
