    net/http: close server conn after broken trailers
    
    Prior to this change, broken trailers would be handled by body.Read, and
    an error would be returned to its caller (likely a Handler), but that
    error would go completely unnoticed by the rest of the server flow
    allowing a broken connection to be reused.  This is a possible request
    smuggling vector.
    
    Fixes #12027.
