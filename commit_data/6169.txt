    solitaire: an exercise in backtracking and string conversions
    
    Solves the (English) peg solitaire game. The board is represented
    by a 1-dimensional array for easy representation of directions
    with a single integer. The board's contents are chosen such that
    it can be printed with a direct string() conversion.
