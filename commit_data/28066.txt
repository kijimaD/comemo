    [dev.garbage] runtime: replace ref with allocCount
    
    This is a renaming of the field ref to the
    more appropriate allocCount. The field
    holds the number of objects in the span
    that are currently allocated. Some throws
    strings were adjusted to more accurately
    convey the meaning of allocCount.
