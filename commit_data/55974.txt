    encoding/gob: use reflect.Value.IsZero
    
    The reflect method was added in Go 1.13, in 2019.
    gob's own version dates all the way back to 2011.
    
    The behavior appears to be the same, and all tests still pass.
    gob does have special cases like always encoding arrays even when they
    are the zero value, but that is done via the sendZero boolean field.
