    cmd/go/internal/work: use par.Cache to cache tool IDs.
    
    The tool IDs can be calculated once and reused across multiple
    threads. This is a small optimization that helps optimize system
    resources.
    
    On a normal Windows machine with 12 virtual CPUs, the time to build
    a hello world program is reduced from over 1 second, with spikes of 2
    seconds, to a consistent 0.7 seconds.
    
    Updates #71981.
