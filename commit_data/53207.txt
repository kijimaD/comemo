    runtime: fall back on mmap if madvise is unsupported
    
    Since Linux 3.18, support for madvise is optional, depending on
    the setting of the CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS configuration option.
    
    The Go runtime currently assumes in several places that we
    do not unmap heap memory; that needs to remain true. So, if
    madvise is unsupported, we cannot fall back on munmap. AFAIK,
    the only way to free the pages is to remap the memory region.
    
    For the x86, the system call mmap() is implemented by sys_mmap2()
    which calls do_mmap2() directly with the same parameters. The main
    call trace for
    mmap(v, n, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0)
    is as follows:
    
    ```
    do_mmap2()
        \- do_mmap_pgoff()
            \- get_unmapped_area()
            \- find_vma_prepare()
    
            // If a VMA was found and it is part of the new mmaping, remove
            // the old mapping as the new one will cover both.
            // Unmap all the pages in the region to be unmapped.
            \- do_munmap()
    
            // Allocate a VMA from the slab allocator.
            \- kmem_cache_alloc()
    
            // Link in the new vm_area_struct.
            \- vma_link()
    ```
    
    So, it's safe to fall back on mmap().
