    os/user: skip tests that create users when running on dev machines
    
    Creating and deleting users is tricky to get right, and it's not
    something we want to do on a developer machine. This change skips the
    tests that create users when not running on a Go builder.
    
    This will fix #70396, although I still don't understand why the test
    user couldn't be recreated.
    
    Fixes #70396
