    os: report Windows exit status in hex
    
    We print things like “exit status 3221225477”
    but the standard Windows form is 0xc0000005.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
