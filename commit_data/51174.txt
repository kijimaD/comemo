    cmd/compile: fix identity case relating to 'any' and shape types
    
    In identical(), we don't want any to match a shape empty-interface type
    for the identStrict option, since IdenticalStrict() is specifically not
    supposed to match a shape type with a non-shape type.
    
    There is similar code in (*Type).cmp() (TINTER case), but I don't
    believe that we want to disqualify shape types from matching any in this
    case, since cmp() is used for back-end code, where we don't care about
    shape types vs non-shape types.
    
    The issue mainly comes about when 'any' is used as a type argument
    (rather than 'interface{}'), but only with some complicated
    circumstances, as shown by the test case. (Couldn't reproduce with
    simpler test cases.)
    
    Fixes #50109
