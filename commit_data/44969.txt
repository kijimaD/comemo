    test/syntax: remove interface.go
    
    The exact same test case covered by this file is also in
    fixedbugs/bug121.go. No need for duplication.
    
    Also, the actual syntax error tested (multiple method names
    with a single signature) is an unlikely syntax error, and
    only here for historical reasons (in the very beginning, this
    was actually possible to write). Now, virtually nobody is making
    this mistake.
