    regexp: fix BenchmarkMatch_onepass_regex
    
    This benchmark - in contrast to all other benchmarks - was
    running the regexp match on 1-byte substrings of the input
    instead of the entire input. Worse, it was doing so by preallocating
    a slice of slices of every 1-byte substring. Needless to say,
    this does not accurately reflect what happens when the regexp
    matcher is given a large input.
