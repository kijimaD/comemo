    reflect: audit and explain safety of all unsafe.Pointer additions
    
    It's not safe to do p+x with unsafe if that would point past the
    end of the object. (Valid in C, not safe in Go.)
    Pass a "whySafe" reason (compiled away) to explain at each
    call site why it's safe.
    
    Fixes #21733.
