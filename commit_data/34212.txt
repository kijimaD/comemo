    runtime: move vdso_linux_amd64.go to vdso_linux.go
    
    This is a preparation step for adding vDSO support on linux/386.
    
    In a follow-on change, the vDSO ELF symbol lookup code in this
    file will be refactored so it can be used on multiple architectures.
    
    First, move the file to an architecture-neutral file name so that
    the change history is preserved. Build tags are added so that the
    build behaves as it did before.
    
    vdso_linux_amd64.go will be recreated later, just containing the
    amd64 specifics.
    
    If the move and refactor were combined in a single change, then the
    history to date would be lost because git would see the existing code
    as a new file.
