    runtime: eliminate parfor ctx field
    
    Prior to the conversion of the runtime to Go, this void* was
    necessary to get closure information in to C callbacks.  There
    are no more C callbacks and parfor is perfectly capable of
    invoking a Go closure now, so eliminate ctx and all of its
    unsafe-ness.  (Plus, the runtime currently doesn't use ctx for
    anything.)
