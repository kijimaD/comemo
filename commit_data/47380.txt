    encoding/xml: handle leading, trailing, or double colons in names
    
    Before this change, <:name> would parse as <name>, which could cause
    issues in applications that rely on the parse-encode cycle to
    round-trip. Similarly, <x name:=""> would parse as expected but then
    have the attribute dropped when serializing because its name was empty.
    Finally, <a:b:c> would parse and get serialized incorrectly. All these
    values are invalid XML, but to minimize the impact of this change, we
    parse them whole into Name.Local.
    
    This issue was reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost as it leads to
    round-trip mismatches. See #43168. It's not being fixed in a security
    release because round-trip stability is not a currently supported
    security property of encoding/xml, and we don't believe these fixes
    would be sufficient to reliably guarantee it in the future.
