    cmd/link: set alignment of compressed section based on arch
    
    The ELF compression header(Chdr) has Addralign field that is set to the
    alignment of the uncompressed section which makes section able to have
    a different alignment than the decompressed section. However `file` and
    other tools require both Chdr.Addralign and Addralign to be equal.
