    cmd/link: rewrite some code without using reflection
    
    In Mach-O DWARF combining, some code was written using reflection,
    so it could support both 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O files without
    duplicating code. We no longer support 32-bit darwin platforms
    now. 32-bit support can go. Rewrite it with direct field access,
    for 64-bit only.
