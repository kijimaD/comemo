    runtime/coverage: add support for "auxiliary" meta-data files
    
    Enhance the functions called by _testmain.go during "go test -cover"
    test binary runs to allow for injection of extra or "auxiliary"
    meta-data files when reporting coverage statistics. There are unit
    tests for this functionality, but it is not yet wired up to be used by
    the Go command yet, that will appear in a subsequent patch.
