    fmt: add Append, Appendln, Appendf
    
    These are straightforward variants of the existing Sprintf etc.,
    but append the resulting bytes to a provided buffer rather than
    returning a string.
    
    Internally, there is potentially some allocation because the package
    uses a pool of buffers to build its output. We make no attempt to
    override that, so the result is first printed into the pool and
    then copied to the output. Since it is a managed pool, asymptotically
    there should be no extra allocation.
