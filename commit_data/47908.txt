    cmd/compile, test: updated comments in crawler.go, added test
    
    Added a test to make sure that the private methods of a local generic
    type are properly exported, if there is a global variable with that
    type.
    
    Added comments in crawler.go, to give more detail and to give more about
    the overall purpose.
    
    Fixed one place where t.isFullyInstantiated() should be replaced by
    isPtrFullyInstantiated(t), so that we catch pointers to generic types
    that may be used as a method receiver.
