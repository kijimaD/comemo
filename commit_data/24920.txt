    cmd/compile/internal/gc: handle weird map literals in key dedup
    
    We compute whether two keys k1 and k2 in a map literal are duplicates by
    constructing the expression OEQ(k1, k2) and calling the constant
    expression evaluator on that expression, then extracting the boolean
    result.
    
    Unfortunately, the constant expression evaluator can fail for various
    reasons.  I'm not really sure why it is dying in the case of 12536, but
    to be safe we should use the result only if we get a constant back (if
    we get a constant back, it must be boolean).  This probably isn't a
    permanent fix, but it should be good enough for 1.5.2.
    
    A permanent fix would be to ensure that the constant expression
    evaluator can always work for map literal keys, and if not the compiler
    should generate an error saying that the key isn't a constant (or isn't
    comparable to some specific other key).
    
    This patch has the effect of allowing the map literal to compile when
    constant eval of the OEQ fails.  If the keys are really equal (which the
    map impl will notice at runtime), one will overwrite the other in the
    resulting map.  Not great, but better than a compiler crash.
    
    Fixes #12536
