    cmd/doc: add test for constructor, fix build
    
    Most important: skip test on darwin/arm64 for unclear reasons.
    
    First cut at the test missed this feature of go doc: when asking for
    the docs for a type, include any function that looks like it constructs
    a that type as a return value.
