    runtime: fix race that dropped GoSysExit events from trace
    
    This makes TestTraceStressStartStop much less flaky.
    Running under stress, it changes the failure rate from
    above 1/100 to under 1/50000. That very unlikely
    failure happens when an unexpected GoSysExit is
    written. Not sure how that happens yet, but it is much
    less important.
    
    Fixes #11953.
