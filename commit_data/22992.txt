    misc/cgo/testcshared: fix test for android.
    
    On android the generated header files are located in
    pkg/$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)_testcshared.
    The test was broken since https://go-review.googlesource.com/9798.
    
    The installation path differs based on codegenArgs
    (around src/cmd/go/build.go line 389), and the codegenArgs
    is platform dependent.
