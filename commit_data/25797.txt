    runtime: make stack barrier locking more robust
    
    The stack barrier locking functions use a simple cas lock because they
    need to support trylock, but currently don't increment g.m.locks. This
    is okay right now because they always run on the system stack or the
    signal stack and are hence non-preemtible, but this could lead to
    difficult-to-reproduce deadlocks if these conditions change in the
    future.
    
    Make these functions more robust by incrementing g.m.locks and making
    them nosplit to enforce non-preemtibility.
