    runtime: zero entire bitmap for object, even past dead marker
    
    We want typedmemmove to use the heap bitmap to determine
    where pointers are, instead of reinterpreting the type information.
    The heap bitmap is simpler to access.
    
    In general, typedmemmove will need to be able to look up the bits
    for any word and find valid pointer information, so fill even after the
    dead marker. Not filling after the dead marker was an optimization
    I introduced only a few days ago, when reintroducing the dead marker
    code. At the time I said it probably wouldn't last, and it didn't.
