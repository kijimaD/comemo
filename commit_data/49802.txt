    test: add test for package-scope method value GC
    
    The Go 1.18 frontend handles package-scope generic method values by
    spilling the receiver value to a global temporary variable, which pins
    it into memory. This issue isn't present in unified IR, which uses
    OMETHVALUE when the receiver type is statically known.
    
    Updates #54343.
