    runtime: fix tiny memory leak
    
    The m->cret word holds the C return value when returning
    across a stack split boundary.  It was not being cleared after
    use, which means that the return value (if a C function)
    or else the value of AX/R0 at the time of the last stack unsplit
    was being kept alive longer than necessary.  Clear it.
    
    I think the effect here should be very small, but worth fixing
    anyway.
