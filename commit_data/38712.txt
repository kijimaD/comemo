    cmd/compile: provide updating mechanism for format test
    
    The compiler's Format test verifies that the correct format
    strings for the given arguments are used in the compiler
    sources. The format strings are fairly specialized which is
    why we cannot use go vet; and the mapping is based on a
    hard-wired map.
    
    In the past, if that map got out of sync with the compiler
    sources, it was necessary to manually update the map. This
    change introduces an update mechanism which simply requires
    the test to be run with the -u flag.
    
    (Formerly, the -u flag was used to automatically rewrite
    format strings; now we use -r for that.)
