    cmd/go/internal/modload: don't initialize build cache
    
    modload.Init initialized the build cache with the intent of providing
    a better error message in Go 1.12, when the build cache became
    mandatory (in module mode, packages aren't installed outside the build
    cache). Unfortunately, this didn't provide a more descriptive error
    (the cache calls base.Fatalf with its own message), and it caused
    errors for commands that don't use the cache (like 'go mod edit').
    
    This CL removes the cache initialization from modload.Init. The
    builder will initialize it when it's needed.
    
    For #39882
