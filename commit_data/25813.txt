    runtime: fix handling VirtualAlloc failure in sysUsed
    
    Original code is mistakenly panics on VirtualAlloc failure - we want
    it to go looking for smaller memory region that VirtualAlloc will
    succeed to allocate. Also return immediately if VirtualAlloc succeeds.
    See rsc comment on issue #12587 for details.
    
    I still don't have a test for this. So I can only hope that this
    
    Fixes #12587
