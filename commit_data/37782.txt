    cmd/go: add regression test for cryptic vcs errors
    
    On Go 1.11.x, if one ran 'go build' on a main package within a module,
    while a needed vcs program like git was missing, a confusing error would
    show up:
    
            build testmod: cannot find module for path rsc.io/quote
    
    The error should instead point at the source of the problem, which is
    the missing vcs program. Thankfully, Go 1.12 doesn't have this bug, even
    though it doesn't seem like the bug was fixed directly and
    intentionally.
    
    To ensure that this particular edge case isn't broken again, add a
    regression test. Piggyback on mod_vcs_missing, since it already requires
    a missing vcs program and network access.
    
    I double-checked that Go 1.11 fails this test via /usr/bin/go, which is
    1.11.3 on my system:
    
            $ PATH=~/tip/bin go test -v -run Script/mod_vcs_missing
            [...]
            > exec /usr/bin/go build
            [stderr]
            build m: cannot find module for path launchpad.net/gocheck
    
    Fixes #28948.
