    mime/multipart: sort header keys to ensure reproducible output
    
    Adds a transparent sort to the mime/multipart package, which is
    only used in the CreatePart func. This will ensure the ordering
    of the MIMEHeader.
    
    The point of this change was to ensure the output would be consistent
    and something that could be depended on.
    
    Fixes #13522
