    crypto/tls: add examples for [Load]X509KeyPair
    
    I was confused about how to start an HTTP server if the server
    cert/key are in memory, not on disk. I thought it would be good to
    show an example of how to use these two functions to accomplish that.
    
    example-cert.pem and example-key.pem were generated using
    crypto/tls/generate_cert.go.
