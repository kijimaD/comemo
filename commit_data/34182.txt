    go/types: make gotype continue after syntax errors
    
    This avoids odd behavior where sometimes a lot of useful
    errors are not reported simply because of a small syntax
    error.
    
    Tested manually with non-existing files. (We cannot easily
    add an automatic test because this is a stand-alone binary
    in this directory that must be built manually.)
    
    Fixes #23593.
