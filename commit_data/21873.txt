    cmd/internal/ld: make ELF constants explicit
    
    c2go produced accurate but complex constant definitions like
    "ElfSymBindLocal  = 0 + iota - 67" which break when any constants
    are added above them in the list. Change them to explicit values
    in separate blocks by class. I wrote a little program (using awk)
    to dump the values of the constants:
    
        https://gist.github.com/mwhudson/82f82008279a38ce584e
    
    and confirmed that its output before and after this change is the
    same.
