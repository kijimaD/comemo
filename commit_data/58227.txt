    crypto/pbkdf2: init package
    
    This commit imports the x/crypto/pbkdf2 package as described in the
    linked proposal. The code is unchanged with the exception of a few
    small updates to reflect feedback from the proposal comment period:
    
    * the Key function is made generic over a hash.Hash
    * the h function is moved to be the first argument
    * keyLen is renamed to keyLength
    * an error return is added
    * the unit tests were moved to the pbkdf2_test package
    
    Updates #69488
