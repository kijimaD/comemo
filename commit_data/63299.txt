    os: disallow Root.Remove(".") on Plan 9, js, and Windows
    
    Windows already forbids this, since removing the root causes a
    sharing violation (can't delete the directory while the os.Root
    has a handle open to it), but add a more explicit check for
    attempts to delete "." and return EINVAL.
    
    Note that this change to Windows doesn't affect operations like
    Root.Remove("dir/."), since the path is cleaned into just "dir"
    before attempting the deletion.
    
    Fixes #73863
