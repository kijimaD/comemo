    text/template: remove duplicate logic in conditional
    
    It looks like this conditional may have been refactored at some point,
    but the logic was still very confusing. The outer conditional checks if
    the function is variadic, so there's no need to verify that in the
    result. Additionally, since the function isn't variadic, there is no
    reason to permit the function call if the number of input arguments is
    less than the function signature requires.
