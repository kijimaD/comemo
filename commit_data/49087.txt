    math/big: don't force second arg to Jacobi and Int.ModSqrt to escape
    
    This CL updates big.Jacobi to avoid forcing its y argument to escape
    to the heap. The argument was escaping because it was being passed
    through an empty interface to fmt.Sprintf during an assertion failure.
    As a result, callers of Jacobi and Int.ModSqrt (which calls Jacobi)
    could not keep this value on the stack.
    
    Noticed when working on https://github.com/cockroachdb/apd/pull/103.
