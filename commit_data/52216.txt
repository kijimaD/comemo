    go/doc: fix incorrect identifier parsing in comments
    
    This code was trying to iterate codepoints, but didn't reslice the string,
    so it was reading the first codepoint over and over, if the string length was
    not a multiple of the first codepoint length, this would cause to overshoot
    past the end of the string.
    
    This was a latent bug introduced in CL 384265 but was revealed to
    Ngolo-fuzzing in OSS-Fuzz in CL 397277.
    
    Fixes #52353
