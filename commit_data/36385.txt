    doc: update "go get" HTTPS answer to mention .netrc
    
    The existing text makes it seem like there's no way
    to use GitHub over HTTPS. There is. Explain that.
    
    Also, the existing text suggests explicit checkout into $GOPATH,
    which is not going to work in the new module world.
    Drop that alternative.
    
    Also, the existing text uses pushInsteadOf instead of insteadOf,
    which would have the effect of being able to push to a private
    repo but not clone it in the first place. That seems not helpful,
    so suggest insteadOf instead.
    
    Fixes #18927.
