    cmd/compile: declare runtime bit func aliases after math/bits intrinsics
    
    Currently runtime/internal/sys bit-manipulation functions are aliased to
    math/bits functions, which are intrinsified. Unfortunately these aliases
    are declared before the intrinsified versions are generated, resulting
    in the generic version of the code being copied over.
    
    This change moves the aliases for bit operations in runtime/internal/sys
    after the addF calls to generate those intrinsics in SSA, so that the
    intrinsified SSA representation of those functions actually get copied
    over.
    
    This should improve the overall performance of the runtime (especially
    the page allocator) since these bit operations will actually be
    intrinsified now.
