    cmd/cgo: wrap generated exports with extern "C" for C++
    
    This will make it possible for C++ code to #include the export header
    file and see the correct declarations.
    
    The preamble remains the user's responsibility.  It would not be
    appropriate to wrap the preamble in extern "C", because it might
    include header files that work with both C and C++.  Putting those
    header files in an extern "C" block would break them.
