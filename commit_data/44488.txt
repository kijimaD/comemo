    cmd/compile: adjust stack slot alignment requirements on arm64
    
    Currently any variable that is spilled onto the stack will occupy at least 8 bytes,
    because the stack offset is required to be aligned with 8 bytes on linux/arm64.
    This CL removes this constraint by aligning the stack slot with its actual size.
    
    Updates #42385
