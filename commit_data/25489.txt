    net/http: add some tests around sending & receiving star requests
    
    I thought there was still work to do in http2 for this, but I guess
    not: the work for parsing them is in net/url (used by http2) and the
    handling of OPTIONS * is already in net/http serverHandler, also used
    by http2.
    
    But keep the tests.
