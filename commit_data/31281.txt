    cmd/compile: remove most uses of duintxx
    
    The only remaining uses of duintxx
    are in the implementation of duintNN.
    I hope to inline those once I figure out why
    CL 40864 is broken.
    
    Note that some uses of duintxx with width Widthint
    were converted into duintptr.
    I did that, since #19954 is officially going to move forward.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
