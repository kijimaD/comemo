    cmd/link: set alignment for carrier symbols
    
    For carrier symbols like type.*, currently we don't set its
    alignment. Normally it doesn't actually matter as we still align
    the inner symbols. But in some cases it does make the symbol table
    a bit weird, e.g. on darwin/arm64,
    
    0000000000070000 s _runtime.types
    0000000000070001 s _type.*
    
    The address of the symbol _type.* is a bit weird. And the new
    darwin linker from Xcode 14 beta doesn't like that (see issue
    53372).
    
    This CL aligns them.
    
    Fixes #53372.
