    cmd/compile: fix buglet in inlined info abstract function dwarf-gen
    
    When generating DWARF inlined info records, it's possible to have a
    local function whose only callsites are inlined away, meaning that we
    emit an abstract function DIE but no regular subprogram DIE. When
    emitting DWARF scope info we need to handle this case (specifically
    when scoping PCs, check for the case that the func in question has
    been entirely deleted).
    
    Fixes #44344.
