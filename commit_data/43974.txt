    runtime/metrics: simplify test to support more environments
    
    go test sets the working directory to that of the package being tested,
    so opening one of the package source files can be done in a simpler way.
    This also allows the test to run in more environments, for example when
    GOROOT_FINAL¹ is set.
    
    Also remove the testenv.HasSrc-like check for Go source. The doc.go
    file is a part of the package being built and tested, so it's expected
    to be available. If it's important for this test to handle when a test
    binary is built with go test -c and executed elsewhere without package
    source files, something more than testenv.HasSrc would be needed.
