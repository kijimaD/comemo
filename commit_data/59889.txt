    cmd/go: download 1.X.0 instead of 1.X during toolchain upgrade.
    
    This CL modifies the download behavior when downloading a toolchain for 1.21+. Previously, Go would attempt to download 1.X when upgrading the toolchain which would cause the download to fail for 1.21+ since 1.X is an invalid toolchain. We will attempt to download 1.X.0 since that's likely what the user intended.
    
    Additionally, we will also now provide a better error message when the
    user provides a language version instead of a toolchain version for
    1.21+.
    
    Fixes #66175
    Fixes #62278
