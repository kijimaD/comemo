    test: add support for code generation tests (asmcheck)
    
    The top-level test harness is modified to support a new kind
    of test: "asmcheck". This is meant to replace asm_test.go
    as an easier and more readable way to test code generation.
    
    I've added a couple of codegen tests to get initial feedback
    on the syntax. I've created them under a common "codegen"
    subdirectory, so that it's easier to run them all with
    "go run run.go -v codegen".
    
    The asmcheck syntax allows to insert line comments that
    can specify a regular expression to match in the assembly code,
    for multiple architectures (the testsuite will automatically
    build each testfile multiple times, one per mentioned architecture).
    
    Negative matches are unsupported for now, so this cannot fully
    replace asm_test yet.
