commit 1e3ffb0c902fc282469e7748ce066ee9ea7a6580

    spec: clarify that slice a expression shares underlying array with operand
    
    The spec was not very precise as to what happens with respect to sharing
    if a sliced operand is (a pointer to) an array. Added a small clarification
    and a supporting example.
    
    Fixes #31689.
