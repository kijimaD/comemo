    [dev.typeparams] runtime: undo go'd closure argument workaround
    
    In CL 298669 we added defer/go wrapping, and, as it is not
    allowed for closures to escape when compiling runtime, we worked
    around it by rewriting go'd closures to argumentless
    non-capturing closures, so it is not a real closure and so not
    needed to escape.
    
    Previous CL removes the restriction. Now we can undo the
    workaround.
    
    Updates #40724.
