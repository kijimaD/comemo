    cmd/go, cmd/dist: temporarily disable race and PIE internal link tests on Alpine
    
    In an effort to at least understand the complete set of things not
    working on Alpine Linux, I've been trying to get the build passing
    again, even with tests disabled.
    
    The race detector is broken on Alpine. That is #14481 (and #9918).
    So disable those tests for now.
    
    Also, internal linking with PIE doesn't work on Alpine yet.
    That is #18243. So disable that test for now.
    
    With this CL, all.bash almost passes. There's some cgo test failing
    still, but there's no bug yet, so that can be a separate CL.
