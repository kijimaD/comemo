    cmd/link: improve comments for relocsym
    
    This patch contains the remnants of CL (122482), which was intended to
    reduce memory allocation in 'relocsym'. Another CL (113637) went in
    first that included pretty much all of the code changes in 122482,
    however there are some changes to comments that are worth preserving.
