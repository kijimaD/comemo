    cmd/compile: load map length with the right type
    
    len(map) is lowered to loading the first field of the map
    structure, which is the length. Currently it is a load of an int.
    With the old map, the first field is indeed an int. With Swiss
    map, however, it is a uint64. On big-endian 32-bit machine,
    loading an (32-bit) int from a uint64 would load just the high
    bits, which are (probably) all 0. Change to a load with the proper
    type.
    
    Fixes #70248.
