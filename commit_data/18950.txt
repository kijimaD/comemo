    net: deflake TestTCPConcurrentAccept
    
    Some platform that implements inp_localgroup-like shared internet
    protocol control block group looks a bit sensitive about transport
    layer protocol's address:port reuse. Sometimes it rejects a TCP SYN
    packet using TCP RST, and sometimes silence.
    
    For now, until test case refactoring, we admit few Dial failures on
    TestTCPConcurrentAccept as a workaround.
