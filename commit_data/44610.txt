    image/gif: add more writer benchmarks
    
    The two existing benchmarks encode randomized pixels, which isn't very
    representative. The two new benchmarks encode a PNG photo as a GIF.
    
    Also rename the benchmarks for consistency.
    
    Also fix the bytes-per-op measure for paletted images, which are 1 (not
    4) bytes per pixel.
    
    Also simplify BenchmarkEncodeRandomPaletted (formerly just called
    BenchmarkEncode). It doesn't need to generate a random palette (and the
    GIF encoder largely doesn't care about the palette's RGBA values).
    Use palette.Plan9 instead, a pre-existing 256-element color palette.
