    runtime: remove legacy comments and code from arm morestack
    
    CL 137410043 deleted support for split stacks, which means morestack
    no longer needed to save its caller's frame or argument size or its
    caller's argument pointer. However, this commit failed to update the
    comment or delete the line that computed the caller's argument
    pointer. Clean these up now.
