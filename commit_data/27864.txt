    cmd/internal/obj: reduce per-architecture opcode space
    
    s390x took up the last available chunk of int16 opcodes.
    There are RISC-V and sparc64 ports in progress out of tree,
    and there will likely be other architectures.
    Reduce the opcode space to allow more architectures to
    fit without increasing to int32.
    
    This is the smallest power of two that accomodates all
    existing architectures. All else being equal, smaller is
    better--smaller numbers are easier to generate immediates
    for and easier on the eyes when debugging.
