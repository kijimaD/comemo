    cmd/go: use cached source files in "go list -find -compiled"
    
    When "go list" is invoked with -find, it clears the list of imports
    for each package matched on the command line. This affects action IDs,
    since they incorporate dependencies' action IDs. Consequently, the
    build triggered by -compiled won't find sources cached by
    "go build".
    
    We can still safely cache compiled sources from multiple runs of
    "go list -find -compiled" though, since cgo generated sources are not
    affected by imported dependencies. This change adds a second look into
    the cache in this situation.
    
    Fixes #29371
