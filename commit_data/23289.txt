    runtime: fix checkmarks to rescan stacks
    
    Currently checkmarks mode fails to rescan stacks because it sees the
    leftover state bits indicating that the stacks haven't changed since
    the last scan. As a result, it won't detect lost marks caused by
    failing to scan stacks correctly during regular garbage collection.
    
    Fix this by marking all stacks dirty before performing the checkmark
    phase.
