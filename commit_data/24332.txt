    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: speed up liveness analysis
    
    This reduces the wall time to run test/slice3.go
    on my laptop from >10m to ~20s.
    
    This could perhaps be further reduced by using
    a worklist of blocks and/or implementing the
    suggestion in the comment in this CL, but at this
    point, it's fast enough that there is no need.
