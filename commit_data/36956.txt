    testing: implement -benchtime=100x
    
    When running benchmarks with profilers and trying to
    compare one run against another, it is very useful to be
    able to force each run to execute exactly the same number
    of iterations.
    
    Discussion on the proposal issue #24735 led to the decision
    to overload -benchtime, so that instead of saying
    -benchtime 10s to run a benchmark for 10 seconds,
    you say -benchtime 100x to run a benchmark 100 times.
    
    Fixes #24735.
