    net: ignore Dial errors in TestAcceptTimeout
    
    Also use DialContext instead of just Dial so that we can ensure
    the call returns before we close the listener.
    
    The Dial in this test is intended to complete before the call to
    Accept, but there is no synchronization to ensure that and sometimes
    it doesn't happen. That's ok and mostly immaterial to the test, but it
    does mean we need to ignore Dial errors (which can happen when the
    listener is closed), and we need to be a little more careful about not
    dialing a port that may have already been reused by some other test.
    
    Fixes #65240.
    Updates #17948.
