    runtime: fix usleep on windows/arm
    
    Changed calling convention to pre-multiply the argument by -100,
    and then deleted the * 100 but not the negation in the windows/arm assembly.
    Delete the negation.
    
    Fixes the current all.bash breakage on windows/arm builder.
    (Maybe that will uncover more.)
