    unicode: build maketables during build, take 2
    
    The "all:" target is the default for running gomake
    by hand, but it is not used during the build.
    The build runs make install and make test.
    
    Save the build of maketables for the test phase
    so that the packages it needs will have been
    installed already.
    
    R=r, r2
