    cmd/go: don't start upload until after toolchain selection
    
    Run telemetry.Start (without the upload) first thing so we can increment
    counters in toolchain selection. Then run telemetry.StartWithUpload
    after toolchain selection so we don't start the upload until after
    toolchain selection has happened so we don't start something heavyweight
    before selection.
