    runtime: In Frames.Next, delay file/line lookup until just before return
    
    That way we will never have to look up the file/line for the frame
    that's next to be returned when the user stops calling Next.
    
    For the benchmark from #32093:
    
    name      old time/op  new time/op  delta
    Helper-4   948ns ± 1%   836ns ± 3%  -11.89%  (p=0.000 n=9+9)
    
    (#32093 was fixed with a more specific, and better, fix, but this
    fix is much more general.)
