    database/sql: fix regression from earlier RawBytes fix
    
    The earlier CL 497675 for #60304 introduced a behavior change
    that, while not strictly a bug, caused a bunch of test failures
    in a large codebase. Rather than add behavior changes in a 10 year
    old package, revert to the old behavior: a context cancelation
    between Rows.Next reporting false and a call to Rows.Err should
    not result in Rows.Err returning the context error.
    
    That behavior was accidentally added in CL 497675 as part of changing
    how contexts and Rows iteration worked.
    
    Updates #60304
    Updates #53970
