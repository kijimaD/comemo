    cmd/link/internal/ld: split varDeclCoords tests
    
    This test set is a bit hard to follow due to trying to test both
    variable and function declaration location information.
    
    Now that we have additional helpers to avoid duplication, it isn't too
    much work to split them up into individually more understandable tests.
