    net/http: don't allow Content-Type or body on 204 and 1xx
    
    Status codes 204, 304, and 1xx don't allow bodies. We already
    had a function for this, but we were hard-coding just 304
    (StatusNotModified) in a few places.  Use the function
    instead, and flesh out tests for all codes.
    
    Fixes #6685
