    sync: replace Mutex benchmarks
    For both contended and uncontended case:
     - support arbitrary number of cpus (not just 2)
     - dynamic load balancing (improves stability)
     - periodic execution of Gosched() to work around non-preemptiviness
    For uncontended case eliminates possible false-sharing.
    For contended case includes additional variation with some
    amount of local work between mutex operations.
