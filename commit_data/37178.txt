    strings: declare IndexByte as noescape
    
    This lets []byte->string conversions which are used as arguments to
    strings.IndexByte and friends have their backing store allocated on
    the stack.
    
    It only prevents allocation when the string is small enough (32
    bytes), so it isn't perfect. But reusing the []byte backing store
    directly requires a bunch more compiler analysis (see #2205 and
    related issues).
    
    Fixes #25864.
