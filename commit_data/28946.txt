    runtime: get s390x vector facility availability from AT_HWCAP
    
    This is a more robust method for obtaining the availability of vx.
    Since this variable may be checked frequently I've also now
    padded it so that it will be in its own cache line.
    
    I've kept the other check (in hash/crc32) the same for now until
    I can figure out the best way to update it.
    
    Updates #15403.
