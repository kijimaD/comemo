    cmd/compile: lower priority of avoiding registers
    
    We avoid allocating registers when we know they may have a fixed use
    later (arg/return value, or the CX shift argument to SHRQ, etc.) But
    it isn't worth avoiding that register if it requires moving another
    register.
    
    A move we may have to do later is not worth a move we definitely have
    to do now.
    
    Fixes #59288
