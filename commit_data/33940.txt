    cmd/compile/internal/types: simplify dclstack
    
    We used to backup symbol declarations using complete Syms, but this
    was unnecessary: very few of Sym's fields were actually needed. Also,
    to restore a symbol, we had to re-Lookup the Sym in its Pkg.
    
    By introducing a new dedicated dsym type for this purpose, we can
    address both of these deficiencies.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
