    cmd/go: for missing binary-only package, say where it should be
    
    Before this CL the user effectively has to guess at the expected
    location of a binary-only package. While the location is normally
    obvious ($GOPATH/pkg/GOOS_GOARCH/PATH/PKG.a) it is much less so when
    building with options that implicitly add an -installsufix option.
    
    Fixes #26590
