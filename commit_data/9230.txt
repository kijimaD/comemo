    image/tiff: Do not panic when RowsPerStrip is missing.
    
    The RowsPerStrip tag is mandatory according to the spec. However,
    Mac OS sometimes (?) omits it. I managed to create such an image
    by applying "tiffutil -none" on a compressed image.
    
    If RowsPerStrip is 0, there was a division by zero in the decoder.
    Assume that the image is a single strip in this case.
