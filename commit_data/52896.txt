    [dev.unified] cmd/compile/internal/noder: stop handling type expressions as expressions
    
    There are two places currently where we rely on type expressions as
    generic expressions: the first argument to "make" and "new", and the
    selectable operand within a method expression.
    
    This CL makes that code responsible for handling the type expressions
    directly. Longer term, this will be relevant to appropriately handling
    derived types, because it will provide additional context about how
    the derived type is to be used.
