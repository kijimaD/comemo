    runtime: stack allocate Panic structure during runtime.panic
    
    Update #7347
    
    When runtime.panic is called the *Panic is malloced from the heap. This can lead to a gc cycle while panicing which can make a bad situation worse.
    
    It appears to be possible to stack allocate the Panic and avoid malloc'ing during a panic.
