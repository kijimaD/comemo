    runtime: use cgo_import_dynamic for QueryPerformanceCounter
    
    QueryPerformanceCounter is available since Windows 2000 [1], so there
    is no need to conditionally load it.
    
    Even if the Go runtime doesn't eventually use it, it is still simpler
    and faster to just tell the Windows loader to load it, instead of doing
    it ourselves.
