    doc/go1.14: highlight the addition of hash/maphash package
    
    Given that it's a package that did not exist before, was a proposal
    in issue #28322, got accepted and implemented for 1.14, it seems to
    be more than a minor change to the library. Highlight it accordingly.
    
    Also specify the results are 64-bit integers, as done in CL 219340.
