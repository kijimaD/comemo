    path/filepath: fix escaped chars in Glob on non-Windows
    
    Backslashes are ignored in Match and Glob on Windows, since those
    collide with the separator character. However, they should still work in
    both functions on other operating systems.
    
    hasMeta did not reflect this logic - it always treated a backslash as a
    non-special character. Do that only on Windows.
    
    Assuming this is what the TODO was referring to, remove it. There are no
    other characters that scanChunk treats especially.
    
    Fixes #23418.
