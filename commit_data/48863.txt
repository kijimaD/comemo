    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: add -d=unifiedquirks for quirks mode
    
    Originally, overloading -d=inlfuncswithclosures=0 to enable quirks
    mode was convenient because toolstash -cmp doesn't provide a way to
    pass different gcflags to the installed vs stashed toolchains. Prior
    to unified IR being merged, the stashed toolchain wouldn't know about
    or accept any unified-specific flags.
    
    However, this concern is no longer applicable since unified IR has
    been merged, and the TestUnifiedCompare test can easily specify
    different flag sets for the baseline and experiment build configs.
    
    This CL adds a new -d=unifiedquirks flag to enable quirks mode, so
    that it's possible to test unified IR with -d=inlfuncswithclosures=0
    without also affecting a bunch of other compilation details.
