    cmd/compile: pass only the itab to the assertI2I-style functions
    
    It is currently slightly better to pass the whole interface to these
    functions, so that we don't need to spill/restore the data word across
    the function call.
    
    I'm adding a cache in front of these calls, which means we'll no longer
    need a spill/restore in the common case, so it is better to just pass
    the itab word.
    
    It also makes unifying the logic between I2I and I2I2 versions easier.
