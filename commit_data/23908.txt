    cmd/internal/obj/arm: fix line numbers after constant pool
    
    If a function is large enough to need to flush the constant pool
    mid-function, the line number assignment code was forcing the
    line numbers not just for the constant pool but for all the instructions
    that follow it. This made the line number information completely
    wrong for all but the beginning of large functions on arm.
    
    Same problem in code copied into arm64.
    
    This broke runtime/trace's TestTraceSymbolize.
    
    Fixes arm build.
