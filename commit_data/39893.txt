    go/ast: fix SortImports to handle block comments
    
    The current algorithm only assumed line comments which always
    appear at the end of an import spec. This caused block comments
    which can appear before a spec to be attached to the previous spec.
    
    So while mapping a comment to an import spec, we maintain additional
    information on whether the comment is supposed to appear on the left
    or right of the spec.
    
    And we also take into account the possibility of "//line" comments
    in the source. So we use unadjusted line numbers.
    
    While at it, added some more testcases from tools/go/ast/astutil/imports_test.go
    
    Fixes #18929
