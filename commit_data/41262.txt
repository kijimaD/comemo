    cmd/compile: parallelize one more bit of rulegen
    
    'go tool trace' pointed at an obvious inefficiency; roughly the first
    fifth of the program's life was CPU-heavy and making use of only one CPU
    core at a time.
    
    This was due to genOp being run before genLower. We did make genLower
    use goroutines to parallelize the work between architectures, but we
    didn't make genOp run in parallel too.
    
    Do that. To avoid having two layers of goroutines, simply fire off all
    goroutines from the main function, and inline genLower, since it now
    becomes just two lines of code.
    
    Overall, this shaves another ~300ms from 'go run *.go' on my laptop.
