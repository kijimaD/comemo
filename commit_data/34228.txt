    cmd/compile: split TestNexting into subtests
    
    This makes it more obvious which of the two builds is failing by
    putting "dbg" or "opt" directly in the test name. It also makes it
    possible for them to fail independently, so a failure in "dbg" doesn't
    mask a failure in "opt", and to visibly skip the opt test when run
    with an unoptimized runtime.
