    go/types: if base type for an alias is known, use it when needed
    
    Because methods are type-checked before the receiver base type
    is "complete" (i.e., they are checked as part of the receiver
    base type), situations occur where aliases of those base types
    are used (in those methods) but the alias types are not known
    yet (even though their base types are known).
    
    This fix is a temporary work-around that looks syntactically
    for the base types of alias types and uses those base types
    when we refer to an "incomplete" alias type. The work-around
    is completely localized and guarded with a flag so it can be
    disabled at short notice.
    
    The correct fix (slated for 1.12) is to decouple type-checking
    of methods from their receiver base types. See issue #26854.
    
    Fixes #26390.
