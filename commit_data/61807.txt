    doc/next: update with reviewed output from relnote todo
    
    This is the result of running relnote todo today and reviewing its
    output. Most of the remaining items that still need to be added to
    Go 1.24 release notes are now tracked in release blocking issues.
    For a few where it's less clear, I opted to comment on issues.
    A good number of items were proposals that affect golang.org/x repos
    and don't need to be mentioned in Go 1.24 release notes; they're now
    annotated as such.
    
    For #68545.
