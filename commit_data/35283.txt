    runtime: fail silently if we unwind over sigpanic into C code
    
    If we're running C code and the code panics, the runtime will inject a
    call to sigpanic into the C code just like it would into Go code.
    However, the return PC from this sigpanic will be in C code. We used
    to silently abort the traceback if we didn't recognize a return PC, so
    this went by quietly. Now we're much louder because in general this is
    a bad thing. However, in this one particular case, it's fine, so if
    we're in cgo and are looking at the return PC of sigpanic, silence the
    debug output.
    
    Fixes #23576.
