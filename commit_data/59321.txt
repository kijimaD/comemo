    internal/poll: remove outdated tests
    
    TestFileFdsAreInitialised and TestSerialFdsAreInitialised were added
    to ensure handles passed to os.NewFile were not added to the runtime
    poller. This used to be problematic because the poller could crash
    if an external I/O event was received (see #21172).
    
    This is not an issue anymore since CL 482495 and #19098.
