    cmd/compile: allow directory specification for GOSSAFUNC output
    
    This was useful for debugging failures occurring during make.bash.
    The added flush also ensures that any hints in the GOSSAFUNC output
    are flushed before fatal exit.
    
    The environment variable GOSSADIR specifies where the SSA html debugging
    files should be placed.  To avoid collisions, each one is written into
    the [package].[functionOrMethod].html, where [package] is the filepath
    separator separated package name, function is the function name, and method
    is either (*Type).Method, or Type.Method, as appropriate.  Directories
    are created as necessary to make this work.
