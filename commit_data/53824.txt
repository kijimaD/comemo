    cmd/go: make go list -m -u all not complain about missing checksums
    
    This is a band-aid of a fix for Go 1.21, to create space to work on
    a real fix for Go 1.22, if in fact the real fix is different. It simply
    disables the go.sum update check during go list -m -u.
    I don't have a self-contained test for the breakage. See #61605.
    All existing tests continue to pass.
    
    For #61605.
    After merging into the Go 1.21 branch we can move #61605 to the Go 1.22 milestone.
