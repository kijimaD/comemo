    net: use DialTimeout in TestSelfConnect
    
    This avoids problems with systems that take a long time to
    find out nothing is listening, while still testing for the
    self-connect misfeature since a self-connect should be fast.
    With this we may be able to remove the test for non-Linux
    systems.
    
    Tested (on GNU/Linux) by editing selfConnect in
    tcpsock_posix.go to always return false and verifying that
    TestSelfConnect then fails with and without this change.
    
    Idea from Uros Bizjak.
