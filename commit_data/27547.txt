    cmd/compile: additional paranoia and checking in plive.go
    
    The main check here is that liveness now crashes if it finds an instruction
    using a variable that should be tracked but is not.
    
    Comments and adjustments in nodarg to explain what's going on and
    to remove the "-1" argument added a few months ago, plus a sketch
    of a future simplification.
    
    The need for n.Orig in the earlier CL seems to have been an intermediate
    problem rather than fundamental: the new explanations in nodarg make
    clear that nodarg is not causing the problem I thought, and in fact now
    using n instead of n.Orig works fine in plive.go.
