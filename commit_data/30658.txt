    archive/zip: skip large concurrent tests in race mode
    
    We recently added these large zip64 tests. They're slow-ish already,
    but fast enough in non-race mode with t.Parallel. But in race mode,
    the concurrency makes them much slower than the normal
    non-race-to-race multiplier.
    
    They're taking so long now that it's causing test failures when it
    sometimes is over the test timeout threshold.
