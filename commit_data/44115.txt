    cmd/internal/objfile: don't require runtime.symtab symbol for XCOFF
    
    For some reason (that I didn't look into), externally linked
    AIX binaries don't have runtime.symtab symbol. Since recent Go
    releases (Go 1.3 maybe?), that symbol is empty and not necessary
    anyway. Don't require it.
    
    Fixes #40972.
