    A+C: add Kush Patel (corporate CLA for Hootsuite Inc)
    
    I'm from Hootsuite. We're a Canadian tech company who provides products
    and services to businesses, organizations and individuals to really help
    them succeed on social. We have leveraged Go in our stack for the past
    4+ years. I am super happy to give back to Go on behalf of Hootsuite
    through a small contribution to pkgsite (with a few more in the works).
    We love this project and we love open source :)
    
    Hopefully we can give back more in the future!
    Kush
