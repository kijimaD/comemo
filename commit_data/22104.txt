commit 564eab891a2a0da77aeec29d94a5a4c0c9d002b8
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    runtime: add GODEBUG=sbrk=1 to bypass memory allocator (and GC)
    
    To reduce lock contention in this mode, makes persistent allocation state per-P,
    which means at most 64 kB overhead x $GOMAXPROCS, which should be
    completely tolerable.
