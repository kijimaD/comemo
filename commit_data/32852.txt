    runtime: fix GDB goroutine N command when N is running
    
    The current implementation of "goroutine N cmd" assumes it can get
    goroutine N's state from the goroutine's sched buffer. But this only
    works if the goroutine is blocked. Extend find_goroutine so that, if
    there is no saved scheduler state for a goorutine, it tries to find
    the thread the goroutine is running on and use the thread's current
    register state. We also extend find_goroutine to understand saved
    syscall register state.
    
    Fixes #13887.
