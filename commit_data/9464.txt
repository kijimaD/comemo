    http: delete error kludge
    
    The kludge is targeted at broken web browsers
    like Chrome and IE, but it gets in the way of
    sending 400 or 500-series error results with
    formatted bodies in response to AJAX requests
    made by pages executing in those browsers.
    
    Now the AJAX cases will work and Chrome
    and IE will be as broken with Go servers as
    they are with all the other servers.
    
    Fixes #2169.
