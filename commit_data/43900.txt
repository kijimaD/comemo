    database/sql: document Connect and Close may need a timeout
    
    Opening a connection with Connect should still create a derived
    context with a timeout because some clients will not use a timeout
    and the connection pool may open a connection asynchronously.
    
    Likewise, if a connection close makes a network operation it should
    provide some type of sane timeout for the operation.
    
    Fixes #38185
