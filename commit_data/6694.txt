commit 59315fbfb5cc24fc130ed683c8be10bc659d3808

    netchan: fix locking bug.
    There's no need to hold the client mutex when calling encode, since encode itself
    uses a mutex to make the writes atomic.  However, we need to keep
    the messages ordered, so add a mutex for that purpose alone.
    Fixes #1244.
