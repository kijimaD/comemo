    net: fix non-blocking connect handling on dragonfly
    
    Performing multiple connect system calls on a non-blocking socket
    under DragonFly BSD does not necessarily result in errors from earlier
    connect calls being returned, particularly if we are connecting to
    localhost. Instead, once netpoll tells us that the socket is ready,
    get the SO_ERROR socket option to see if the connection succeeded
    or failed.
    
    Fixes #7474
