    cmd/dist: simplify work list functions
    
    There are no uses of addCmd, so delete it. The only use of bgDirCmd is
    dirCmd, so inline it. Now the only function that interacts with the
    work queue is registerTest and dist's "background commands" are used
    exclusively in goTest.bgCommand and registerTest (which calls
    goTest.bgCommand).
    
    For #37486.
