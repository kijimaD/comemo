    all: replace usages of whitelist/blacklist and master/slave
    
    There's been plenty of discussion on the usage of these terms in tech.
    I'm not trying to have yet another debate. It's clear that there are
    people who are hurt by them and who are made to feel unwelcome by their
    use due not to technical reasons but to their historical and social
    context. That's simply enough reason to replace them.
    
    Anyway, allowlist and blocklist are more self-explanatory than whitelist
    and blacklist, so this change has negative cost.
    
    Didn't change vendored, bundled, and minified files. Nearly all changes
    are tests or comments, with a couple renames in cmd/link and cmd/oldlink
    which are extremely safe. This should be fine to land during the freeze
    without even asking for an exception.
