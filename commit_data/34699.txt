    cmd/go: always update mtime during go install / go build -o / go test -c
    
    Even if the go command can see that the target is up-to-date
    an mtime-based build system invoking the go command may not
    be able to tell. Update the mtime to make clear that the target is
    up-to-date, and also to hide exactly how smart the go command
    is or is not. This keeps users (and programs) from depending on
    the exact details of the go command's staleness determination.
    
    Without this I believe we will get a stream of (completely reasonable)
    bug reports that "go install (or go test -c) did not update the binary
    after I trivially changed the source code or touched a source file".
