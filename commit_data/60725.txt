    internal/pkgbits: add Version type
    
    Adds a new Version type to pkgbits to represent the version of the
    bitstream. Versions let readers and writers know when different data is
    expected to be present or not in the bitstream. These different pieces
    of data are called Fields, as an analogy with fields of a struct.
    Fields can be added, removed or changed in a Version. Extends Encoder
    and Decoder to report which version they are.
    
    Updates #68778
