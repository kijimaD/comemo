    cmd/vet: do not import net/http at startup
    
    The httpresponse.go module wants to be able to tell if a particular type t
    is net/http.Response (and also net/http.Client). It does this by importing
    net/http, looking up Response, and then comparing that saved type against
    each t.
    
    Instead of doing an eager import of net/http, wait until we have a type t
    to ask a question about, and then just look to see if that t is http.Response.
    This kind of lazy check does not require assuming that net/http is available
    or will be important (perhaps the check is disabled in this run, or perhaps
    other conditions that lead to the comparison are not satisfied).
    
    Not loading these kinds of types at startup time will scale better.
