    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: improve comment and signature of pcAlignPadLength
    
    The function just calculates the number of needed padding bytes,
    instead of actually carrying out the alignment operation. And it has
    the context argument at the end of the argument list, while contexts
    idiomatically come first. Indeed, this is the only case in
    cmd/internal/obj where ctxt is not the only argument and does not come
    first.
    
    Fix those two nits; no functional change intended.
    
    Suggested by Ian during review of CL 479815 (that introduces a copy of
    this helper into the loong64 port).
