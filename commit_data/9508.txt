    net: disable "tcp" test on openbsd
    
    Doing a socket/listen on an unspecified address with an unspecified
    address family is likely to result in an AF_INET6 socket on an IPv6
    capable system, which under OpenBSD means IPv6 only - not IPv4 *and*
    IPv6. In this case trying to connect to this socket from an IPv4
    loopback address is not going to end well.
