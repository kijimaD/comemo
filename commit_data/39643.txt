    test: fix memcombine tests
    
    Two tests (load_le_byte8_uint64_inv and load_be_byte8_uint64)
    pass but the generated code isn't actually correct.
    
    The test regexp provides a false negative, as it matches the
    MOVQ (SP), BP instruction in the epilogue.
    
    Combined loads never worked for these cases - the test was added in error
    as part of a batch and not noticed because of the above false match.
    
    Normalize the amd64/386 tests to always negative match on narrower
    loads and OR.
