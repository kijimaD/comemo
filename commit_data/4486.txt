commit 8c557962de06deff625dfe200b80ea4583b51ba4
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 24 07:17:49 2009 +1100

    make 6prof (sic) architecture-independent.
    for now, it's amd64 and 386 only but it's trivial to add more.
    
    Fixes #385.
    
    (why couldn't it have been issue 386?)
    
    tested for amd64 and 386 on darwin.
