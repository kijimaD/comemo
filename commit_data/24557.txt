-Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may redeclare variables provided they
-were originally declared earlier in the same block with the same type, and at
-least one of the non-<a href="#Blank_identifier">blank</a> variables is new.  As a consequence, redeclaration
-can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration.
-Redeclaration does not introduce a new
-variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.
