    crypto/subtle: don't cast to *uintptr when word size is 0
    
    Casting to a *uintptr is not ok if there isn't at least 8 bytes of
    data backing that pointer (on 64-bit archs).
    So although we end up making a slice of 0 length with that pointer,
    the cast itself doesn't know that.
    Instead, bail early if the result is going to be 0 length.
    
    Fixes #59334
