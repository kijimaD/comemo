commit af678a593da3e2bc942aa3bf41e66bd50e0b3bab
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    new approach for generating sysimport.c
    (renamed to avoid any conflict with old p4 copies).
    
    this approach doesn't require auto-generating
    files also kept in p4, so it should be easier on
    go users who don't sync very often.
    
    this approach will be more work for go developers:
    builtin.c needs to be copied to builtin.c.boot in p4
    as new functions are added.  mkbuiltin does this
    for certain $USERs to help us remember.
