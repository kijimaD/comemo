    runtime: remove maxstring
    
    Before this CL the runtime prevented printing of overlong strings with the print
    function when the length of the string was determined to be corrupted.
    Corruption was checked by comparing the string size against the limit
    which was stored in maxstring.
    
    However maxstring was not updated everywhere were go strings were created
    e.g. for string constants during compile time. Thereby the check for maximum
    string length prevented the printing of some valid strings.
    
    The protection maxstring provided did not warrant the bookkeeping
    and global synchronization needed to keep maxstring updated to the
    correct limit everywhere.
    
    Fixes #16999
