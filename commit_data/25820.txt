    net: fix TestUpdateResolvConf after CL 18860
    
    When writing a fake dnsConfig to conf.dnsConfig, set lastChecked to an
    hour into the future.  This causes dnsclient_unix.go's
    tryUpdate("/etc/resolv.conf") calls to short-circuit and ignore that
    /etc/resolv.conf's mtime differs from the test's fake resolv.conf
    file.  We only need to zero out lastChecked in teardown.
    
    While here, this makes two other tryUpdate(conf.path) test calls
    pointless, since they'll now short circuit too.
    
    Fixes #14437.
