    runtime: guard against runtime/sema* ops on Darwin signal stack.
    
    These operations misbehave and cause hangs and flakes.
    Fail hard if they are attempted.
    
    Tested by backing out the Darwin-profiling-hang fix
    CL 518836 and running run.bash, the guard panicked in
    runtime/pprof tests, as expected/hoped.
    
    Updates #61768
