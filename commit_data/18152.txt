commit d4c66a35baba191b5857960d75fe66d766f6d573

    runtime: add a test for randomised map iteration order.
    
    Technically the spec does not guarantee that the iteration order is random,
    but it is a property that we have consciously pursued, and so it seems
    right to verify that our implementation does indeed randomise.
    
    Update #6719.
