    cmd/go: make go line declare minimum required Go version
    
    For #57001, enforce the go line as declaring the minimum required
    version of Go that can compile a module.
    
    Modules that maintain compatibility with old versions of Go
    but want to make use of new features in //go:build-constrained files
    will be able to do so: the //go:build constraint will be interpreted
    as changing the minimum Go version for that file and will unlock
    the Go features allowed in that version.
