    cmd/compile: add special case for testing first field of struct variable
    
    The change to the write barrier in https://golang.org/cl/16899 means
    that the compiler now emits tests of the first field of a struct.  That
    was using a register that was not used before.  This change fixes that
    for amd64 by adding a special case for the first field of a struct.
    
    Update #12416.
