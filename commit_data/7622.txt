    http: allow handlers to send non-chunked responses
    
    Currently all http handlers reply to HTTP/1.1 requests with
    chunked responses.  This patch allows handlers to opt-out of
    that behavior by pre-declaring their Content-Length (which is
    then enforced) and unsetting their Transfer-Encoding or
    setting it to the "identity" encoding.
