    net/http/fcgi: expose cgi env vars in request context
    
    The current interface can't access all environment
    variables directly or via cgi.RequestFromMap, which
    only reads variables on its "white list" to be set on
    the http.Request it returns. If an fcgi variable is
    not on the "white list" - e.g. REMOTE_USER - the old
    code has no access to its value.
    
    This passes variables in the Request context that aren't
    used to add data to the Request itself and adds a method
    that parses those env vars from the Request's context.
    
    Fixes #16546
