    path/filepath: revert "fix Windows-specific Clean bug"
    
    Revert CL 137055, which changed Clean("\\somepath\dir\") to return
    "\\somepath\dir" on Windows. It's not entirely clear this is correct,
    as this path is really "\\server\share\", and as such the trailing
    slash may be the path on that share, much like "C:\". In any case, the
    change broke existing code, so roll it back for now and rethink for 1.13.
    
    Updates #27791
    Fixes #30307
