commit bbe601789cf7526925192abe0a6bc7e7d9265588
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    encoding/gob: disable fuzz tests unless command-line flag is set
    
    They can generate huge amounts of memory, causing failure on
    small machines. Also they can be very slow. So slow that one test
    was commented out! We uncomment it and use a flag.
    
    Fixes #3742.
