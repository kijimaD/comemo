    encoding: document that base32 and base64 do not use UTF-8
    
    The invention of base32 and base64 predates the invention of UTF-8
    and was never meant to output valid UTF-8.
    By default, the output is always valid ASCII (and thus valid UTF-8)
    except when the user specifies an alphabet or padding value
    that is larger than '\x7f'. If that is done,
    then the exact byte symbol is used rather than the UTF-8 encoding.
    
    Fixes #60689
