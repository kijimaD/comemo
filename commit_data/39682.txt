    cmd/go/internal/base: remove MergeEnvLists
    
    This internally exported function allowed merging environment variable
    lists, and was mostly a convenience for the rest of cmd/go/internal.
    It seems to date all the way back to 2013.
    
    However, since CL 37586 in early 2017, os/exec has already taken care of
    deduplicating environment variable lists. Thus, it's unnecessary for
    cmd/go to take care of that before calling exec.Cmd.Start.
    
    Moreover, because os/exec will deduplicate the list in any case, we're
    adding extra work in all these scenarios.
    
    Finally, remove an unnecessary addition of GOROOT= in internal/tool.
    cfg.OrigEnv may not have the correct GOROOT set up, but os.Environ does;
    cmd/go's main function makes sure of that.
