    net/http/httptest: don't register a flag unless it looks like it's in use
    
    We shouldn't pollute people's flags with this debugging flag that was
    never really meant to be public. It's certainly not documented.
    
    So keep it for now, but don't register it unless it looks like it's in
    use (by looking at os.Args). Kinda gross, but less gross than before.
    
    Fixes #28619
