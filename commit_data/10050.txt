+This weekly snapshot includes some language and package changes that may
+require code changes. Please read these notes carefully, as there are many
+changes and your code will likely be affected.
+
+The syntax for map deletion has been changed. Code that looks like:
+	m[x] = 0, false
+should be written as:
+	delete(m, x)
+The compiler still accepts m[x] = 0, false for now; even so, you can use gofix
+to rewrite such assignments into delete(m, x).
+
+The Go compiler will reject a return statement without arguments when any of
+the result variables has been shadowed. Code rejected as a result of this
+change is likely to be buggy.
+
+Receive-only channels (<-chan T) cannot be closed.
+The compiler will diagnose such attempts.
+
+The first element of a map iteration is chosen at random. Code that depends on
+iteration order will need to be updated.
+
+Goroutines may be run during program initialization.
+
+A string may be appended to a byte slice. This code is now legal:
+	var b []byte
+	var s string
+	b = append(b, s...)
+
+The gotry command and its associated try package have been deleted.
+It was a fun experiment that - in the end - didn't carry its weight.
+
+The gotype tool has been moved to exp/gotype and its associated go/types
+package has been moved to exp/types. The deprecated go/typechecker package has
+been deleted.
+
+The enbflint tool has been moved to pkg/exp/ebnflint and its associated ebnf
+package has been moved to pkg/exp/ebnf.
+
+The netchan package has been moved to old/netchan.
+
+The http/spdy package has been moved to exp/spdy.
+
+The exp/datafmt package has been deleted.
+
+The container/vector package has been deleted. Slices are better:
