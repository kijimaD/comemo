    cmd/compile: in prove, fail fast when unsat is found
    
    When an unsatisfiable relation is recorded in the facts table,
    there is no need to compute further relations or updates
    additional data structures.
    
    Since we're about to transitively propagate relations, make
    sure to fail as fast as possible to avoid doing useless work
    in dead branches.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
