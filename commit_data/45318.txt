    debug/dwarf: skip over zero-length compilation units
    
    DWARF sections generated by mingw-clang seem to include these
    (not often - only one out of many in the binary that I am looking at).
    Skipping over them, everything parses correctly.
    
    This makes TestDefaultLinkerDWARF pass on windows/arm64.
