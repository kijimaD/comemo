commit 53c92f95a888837571eda1cf356425010f92edde
Author: Shenghou Ma <minux@golang.org>

    os: document that behavior of Seek on O_APPEND files is not specified
    
    The actual behavior varies across platforms, and due to the inherent
    race, we can't do anything better (other than to always return 0).
    
    Fixes #12710.
