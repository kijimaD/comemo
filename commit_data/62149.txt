    {all,clean,make,race,run}.bat: remove %GOBUILDEXIT% and %GOBUILDFAIL%
    
    %GOBUILDEXIT% is used to avoid closing the terminal window when the
    build or the tests fail on a dev machine. It is only set in CI to get
    a non-zero exit code in case of failure.
    
    %GOBUILDFAIL% is used to pass the exit code from a child batch file to
    the parent batch file. It is set to 1 in the child batch file if the
    build or the tests fail.
    
    These two variables add complexity to the batch files and impose some
    limitations on how they are implemented. For example, the child files
    can't use setlocal, as it would make the parent file unable to read the
    %GOBUILDFAIL% variable.
    
    This CL removes these two variables and replaces them with unconditional
    calls to "exit /b 1" in case of failure, which is more idiomatic and
    composable. The trick is that the "/b" parameter makes the exit only
    apply to the current batch file, not the entire shell session (unless
    the bat file is the root, in which case the parameter is ignored), so
    the parent batch file can continue executing, potentially checking the
    errorlevel of the child batch file (which we always set to 1).
