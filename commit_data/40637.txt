    cmd/go: recommend -d when -m is used
    
    In #32038, it was decided to remove get's -m, since one former use case
    is removed, and the other can be done via -d, as pointed by Russ.
    
    However, a user getting this short error might not realise that they can
    switch to -d to skip building packages. Add a short mention to point
    them in the right direction.
    
    It's important to note "packages", because -m was a flag that acted on
    modules, while -d acts on packages. Simply replacing -m with -d might
    not be enough in some cases because of that distinction.
