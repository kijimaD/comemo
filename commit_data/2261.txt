    reflect bug: NewZeroValue was refusing to create slices.
    as far as I can tell there's no reason not to.
    
    the Nillable test was succeeding because NewZeroValue
    returned the nil interface value and the type guard
    was letting it through.  the only change in the test is
    more detail in the print.
