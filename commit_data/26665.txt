    cmd/compile: set lexer nlsemi state directly
    
    The old code used an extra function call and switch to inspect the
    current token and determine the new state of curio.nlsemi. However,
    the lexer knows the token w/o the need of an extra test and thus
    can set curio.nlsemi directly:
    
    - removed need for extra function call in next
    - renamed _yylex to next
    - set nlsemi at the point a token is identified
    - moved nlsemi from curio to lexer - it's really part of the lexer state
    
    This change makes the lexer call sequence less convoluted and should
    also speed up the lexing a bit.
