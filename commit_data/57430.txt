    cmd/compile: remove types.Type rparams field
    
    This field is present during the initial development of generic support
    inside compiler, and indicating whether a type is fully instantiated is
    the solely purpose at this moment. Further, its name is also confused,
    and there have been a TODO to chose a better name for it.
    
    Instead, just using a bit to track whether a type is fully instantiated,
    then this rparams field can be removed to simplify the code.
