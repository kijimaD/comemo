    test: relax closure name matching in closure3.go
    
    The mismatch between Unified IR and the old frontend is not about how
    they number the closures, but how they name them. For nested closure,
    the old frontend use the immediate function which contains the closure
    as the outer function, while Unified IR uses the outer most function as
    the outer for all closures.
    
    That said, what important is matching the number of closures, not their
    name prefix. So this CL relax the test to match both "main.func1.func2"
    and "main.func1.2" to satisfy both Unified IR and the old frontend.
