    cmd/go: replace a.Package.Internal.Pkgfile with a.built
    
    Logically the build needs to start treating a.Package as immutable,
    since we might want to build a.Package multiple ways.
    Record the built target in a.built instead.
    
    Right now a.built is predictable ahead of time, but we want to
    move toward satisfying some builds from a cache directory,
    in which case a.built will point into the cache directory
    and not be determined until action execution time.
    
    There is probably more to do with shared libraries, but this
    does not break what's there.
