    runtime: proper panic tracebacks with mid-stack inlining
    
    As a followon to CL 152537, modify the panic-printing traceback
    to also handle mid-stack inlining correctly.
    
    Also declare -fm functions (aka method functions) as wrappers, so that
    they get elided during traceback. This fixes part 2 of #26839.
    
    Fixes #28640
    Fixes #24488
    Update #26839
