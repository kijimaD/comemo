    cmd/go, cmd/link: silence bogus Apple Xcode warning
    
    Certain installations of Xcode are affected by a bug that causes
    them to print an inconsequential link-time warning that looks like:
    
            ld: warning: text-based stub file /System/Library/Frameworks//Security.framework/Security.tbd and library file /System/Library/Frameworks//Security.framework/Security are out of sync. Falling back to library file for linking.
    
    This has nothing to do with Go, and we've sent this repro case
    to Apple:
    
            $ pkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables | grep version
            version: 10.0.0.0.1.1535735448
            $ clang --version
            Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.44.2)
            Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0
            Thread model: posix
            InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
            $ cat > issue.c
            int main() { return 0; }
            ^D
            $ clang issue.c -framework CoreFoundation
            ld: warning: text-based stub file /System/Library/Frameworks//CoreFoundation.framework/CoreFoundation.tbd and library file /System/Library/Frameworks//CoreFoundation.framework/CoreFoundation are out of sync. Falling back to library file for linking.
            $
    
    Even if Apple does release a fixed Xcode, many people are seeing
    this useless warning, and we might as well make it go away.
    
    Fixes #26073.
