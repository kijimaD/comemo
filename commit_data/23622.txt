    debug/pe: truncate pe sections to their size in memory
    
    Section.Data returns disk section data, but those are rounded up to
    some predefined value. Processing these as is confuses dwarf parser
    because of garbage at the end. Truncate Section.Data as per memory
    section description.
    
    Sometimes dwarf sections have memory section size of 0
    (for pe object files). Keep those to their disk size.
    
    Fixes #11608
