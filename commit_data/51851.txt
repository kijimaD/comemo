    cmd/dist, internal/platform: test agreement on supported build modes
    
    This synchronizes the supported build modes between cmd/dist and
    internal/platform, and adds a test to keep them in synch.
    
    In order to do that, this has several changes to cmd/dist, and one
    change to internal/platform.
    
    If the build dashboard is green after this is submitted, we can
    probably make the functions identical.
