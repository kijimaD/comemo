    net: remove parsing of negative decimals in IPv4 literal
    
    https://golang.org/cl/27206 fixed the dtoi function such that
    it now properly parses negative number. Ironically, this causes
    several other functions that depended on dtoi to now (incorrectly)
    parse negative numbers.
    
    For example, ParseCIDR("-1.0.0.0/32") used to be rejected prior to the
    above CL, but is now accepted even though it is an invalid CIDR notation.
    This CL fixes that regression.
    
    We fix this by removing the signed parsing logic entirely from dtoi.
    It was introduced relatively recently in https://golang.org/cl/12447
    to fix a bug where an invalid port was improperly being parsed as OK.
    It seems to me that the fix in that CL to the port handling logic was
    sufficient such that a change to dtoi was unnecessary.
