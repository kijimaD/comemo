    cmd/compile: fix inlining function has shape in type
    
    CL 395854 made inline pass to not inlining function with shape params,
    but pass no shape arguments. But it does not consider the case where
    function has shape params, but passing zero arguments. In this case, the
    un-safe interface conversion that may be applied to a shape argument can
    not happen, so it's safe to inline the function.
    
    Fixes #52907
