    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: remove remaining uses of Unshapify
    
    The other uses of Unshapify were really only there to allow for the
    dictionary checking code at the beginning of generic functions/methods.
    But that will go away as soon as we start combining real shapes. If we
    get rid of that code, we can get rid of the unshapify calls elsewhere.
    
    The only tricky part is that getInstantiation now gets targs that may each
    either be a shape or concrete type, and it must translate any concrete
    types to shapes, while leaving the already existing shapes.
