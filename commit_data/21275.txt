commit 60ea2c594bdfb8d0ae4e13c8a028e59ed07bf9a9

    test: add test that gccgo failed to compile
    
    Gccgo failed to create the type descriptor for the type used to
    allocate the nil value passed to append as the second argument when
    append is called with only one argument.  Calling append with only one
    argument is unusual but obviously should not cause a compiler crash.
