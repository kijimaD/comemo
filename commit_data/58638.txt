    runtime: disable trace v2 optimistic deadlock debugger
    
    The v2 execution tracer has a rudimentary deadlock detector, but it's
    based on an arbitrary threshold that an actually get hit even if there's
    no deadlock. This ends up breaking tests sometimes, and it would be bad
    if this just appeared in production logs.
    
    Put this 'deadlock detector' behind a flag.
    
    For #55317.
