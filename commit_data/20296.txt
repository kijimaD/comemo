    runtime: run runtime.init
    
    Run it right before main.init.
    There is still some runtime initialization that
    happens before runtime.init, and some of that
    may call into Go code (for example to acquire locks)
    so this timing is not perfect, but I believe it is the
    best we can do.
    
    This came up because global variables intialized
    to func values are done in the generated init code,
    not in the linker.
