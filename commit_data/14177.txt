commit e55fdff21030e4925086af90fa669b3e378f2dfc

    bufio: make Writer.ReadFrom not flush prematurely. For example,
    many small writes to a network may be less efficient that a few
    large writes.
    
    This fixes net/http's TestClientWrites, broken by 6565056 that
    introduced Writer.ReadFrom. That test implicitly assumed that
    calling io.Copy on a *bufio.Writer wouldn't write to the
    underlying network until the buffer was full.
