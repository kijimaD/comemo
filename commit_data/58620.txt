    internal/trace/traceviewer: make the mmu handler more self-contained
    
    The last change made the MMU rendering code common and introduced a new
    API, but it was kind of messy. Part of the problem was that some of the
    Javascript in the template for the main page referred to specific
    endpoints on the server.
    
    Fix this by having the Javascript access the same endpoint but with a
    different query variable. Now the Javascript code doesn't depend on
    specific endpoints, just on query variables for the current endpoint.
    
    For #60773.
    For #63960.
