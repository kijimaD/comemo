    cmd/gofmt: fix a data race in TestPermissions
    
    The asynchronous call to processFile is synchronized by the call to
    GetExitCode. We can't safely access errBuf until then, because
    processFile may still be writing to it.
    
    This is diagnosed by 'go test -race cmd/gofmt', but only the
    darwin-amd64-race builder caught it because the other "-race" builders
    apparently all run as root (see #10719).
    
    Updates #60225.
