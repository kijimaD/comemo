    runtime: replace index and contains with bytealg calls
    
    The runtime has its own implementation of string indexing. To reduce
    code duplication and cognitive load, replace this with calls to the
    internal/bytealg package. We can't do this on Plan 9 because it needs
    string indexing in a note handler (which isn't allowed to use the
    optimized bytealg version because it uses SSE), so we can't just
    eliminate the index function, but this CL does down-scope it so make
    it clear it's only for note handlers on Plan 9.
