commit cd2ecfb7b35cb4199bcbc735bd120393e6c4ba8e
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 6 08:53:46 2010 +1100

    Ugly hack to provide some mechanism for printing documentation about
    Go source outside $GOROOT.
    
    If the argument is a path starting with / or ., disregard $GOROOT.
    Also, disable the check for package name matching the directory,
    which is counterproductive in this case.
    
    Apologies for the violence to the code but we need some help documenting
    Go code outside the standard repository.
