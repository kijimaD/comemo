    encoding/xml: add wildcard support for collecting all attributes
    
    - Like ",any" for elements, add ",any,attr" for attributes to allow
      a mop-up field that gets any otherwise unmapped attributes.
    - Map attributes to fields of type slice by extending the slice,
      just like for elements.
    - Allow storing an attribute into an xml.Attr directly, to provide
      a way to record the name.
    
    Combined, these three independent features allow
    
            AllAttrs []Attr `xml:",any,attr"`
    
    to collect all attributes not otherwise spoken for in a particular struct.
    
    Tests based on CL 16292 by Charles Weill.
    
    Fixes #3633.
