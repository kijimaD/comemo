    cmd/go: send output of build and install to stderr
    
    "go build" and "go install" were mixing stdout and stderr
    from the toolchain, then putting it all on stdout. With this
    change, it stays mixed, and is sent to stderr. Because
    the toolchain does not create output in a clean compile/install,
    sending all output to stderr makese more sense.
    
    Also fix test.bash because of "mktemp: too few X's
    in template `testgo'" on Linux.
    
    Fixes #4917.
