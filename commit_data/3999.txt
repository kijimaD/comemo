commit 2643f742a5b7c5db8a51fbe0b5b824190c9d5571
Author: Adam Langley <agl@golang.org>

    make.bash: detect and warn about SELinux policy that crashes us.
    
    The default SELinux policy on Fedora 12 (at least) disallows stack
    pages to be +x. This causes all binaries written by 6g/6l to segfault
    immedately. The 'true' way to fix this issue is to mark binaries with
    the correct type. However, that assumes that 6l is going to detect
    SELinux, figure out the correct type for the current distribution and
    set the type (without libselinux).
    
    For now we'll warn users and point them towards the way to enable
    execstack for the whole system.
