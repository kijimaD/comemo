       The race detector has been upgraded to use thread sanitizer
-      version v3. Compared to v2, it is now typically 1.5x to 2x
-      faster, uses half as much memory, and it supports an unlimited
-      number of goroutines.
+      version v3 on all supported platforms
+      except <code>windows/amd64</code>
+      and <code>openbsd/amd64</code>, which remain on v2.
