 To avoid portability issues all numeric types are distinct except
 <code>byte</code>, which is an alias for <code>uint8</code>, and
-<code>rune</code>, which is an alias for <code>int</code> (to become
-<code>int32</code> in a later version of Go).
+<code>rune</code>, which is an alias for <code>int32</code>.

 are required when different numeric types are mixed in an expression
 or assignment. For instance, <code>int32</code> and <code>int</code>
