    cmd/compile: remove PDISCARD class
    
    This pseudo-Class was previously used by the importer code to optimize
    processing duplicate inline bodies, since we didn't actually care
    about the declarations in those contexts.
    
    This functionality is no longer needed with indexed exports, since we
    now only process function bodies as needed (and never more than once).
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
