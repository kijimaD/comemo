    cmd/cc: grow some global arrays
    
    Avoids global array buffer overflows if they are
    indexed using some of the values between NTYPE
    and NALLTYPE.  It is entirely likely that not all of these
    are necessary, but this is the C compiler and not worth
    worrying much about.  This change takes up only a
    few more bytes of memory and makes the behavior
    deterministic.
    
    Fixes #3078.
