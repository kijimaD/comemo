    net/http: explain more how Pusher.Push works
    
    This will clarify that the resources are not completely pushed yet when `Push` returns and that it starts a separate goroutine. This might be implementation dependant but as I believe there is currently only one implementation it should be added to the documentation of the interface which most people will look up first.
