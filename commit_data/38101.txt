    cmd/asm: improve DATA size operand validation
    
    Prior to this change, DATA instructions accepted
    the values 1, 2, 4, and 8 as sizes.
    The acceptable sizes were further restricted
    to 4 and 8 for float constants.
    
    This was both too restrictive and not restrictive enough:
    string constants may reasonably have any length,
    and address constants should really only accept pointer-length sizes.
    
    Fixes #30269
