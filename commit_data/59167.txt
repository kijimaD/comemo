    internal/poll,net: set SIO_UDP_CONNRESET in net
    
    Setting the SIO_UDP_CONNRESET option in internal/poll.FD.Init
    adds unnecessary complexity to the FD.Init signature and
    implementation. Better to set it in the net package when initializing
    the UDP connection, which is where conceptually it belongs.
    
    While here, update an outdated comment in FD.Init that said the runtime
    poller doesn't support I/O operations initialized by the user
    outside the internal/poll package. It does support those operations
    since CL 561895.
    
    For #19098.
    Updates #21172.
