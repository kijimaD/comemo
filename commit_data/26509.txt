    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: simple forward-looking register allocation tweak
    
    For each value that needs to be in a fixed register at the end of the
    block, and try to pick that fixed register when the instruction
    generating that value is scheduled (or restored from a spill).
    
    Just used for end-of-block register requirements for now.
    Fixed-register instruction requirements (e.g. shift in ecx) can be
    added later.  Also two-instruction constraints (input reg == output
    reg) might be recorded in a similar manner.
