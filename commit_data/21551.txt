    runtime: don't put container symbols in functab
    
    Container symbols shouldn't be considered as functions in the functab.
    Having them present probably messes up function lookup, as you might get
    the descriptor of the container instead of the descriptor of the actual
    function on the stack.  It also messed up the findfunctab because these
    entries caused off-by-one errors in how functab entries were counted.
    
    Normal code is not affected - it only changes (& hopefully fixes) the
    behavior for libraries linked as a unit, like:
      net
      runtime/cgo
      runtime/race
    
    Fixes #9804
