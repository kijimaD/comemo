    [dev.link] cmd/compile: refactor aux handling in newobj sym traversal
    
    Generalize symbol traversal code for aux symbols to allow for client
    control over whether the walk incldues symbols referenced by
    relocations on visited aux syms. This is not needed just yet but will
    be required in order to support anonymous aux syms that have
    relocations.
