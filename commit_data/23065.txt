    runtime: disallow preemption during startTheWorld
    
    Currently, startTheWorld clears preemptoff for the current M before
    starting the world. A few callers increment m.locks around
    startTheWorld, presumably to prevent preemption any time during
    starting the world. This is almost certainly pointless (none of the
    other callers do this), but there's no harm in making startTheWorld
    keep preemption disabled until it's all done, which definitely lets us
    drop these m.locks manipulations.
