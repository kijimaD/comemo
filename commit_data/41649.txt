    [dev.link] cmd/link: new loader method for reading relocations in batch
    
    Add a new loader.Relocs method that reads all of the relocations for a
    symbol into a slice. Handy in cases where the client knows in advance
    that it wants to visit all the relocations on a symbol (as opposed to
    just one or two).
