    runtime/pprof: Mention goroutine label heritability
    
    Document goroutine label inheritance. Goroutine labels are copied upon
    goroutine creation and there is a test enforcing this, but it was not
    mentioned in the docstrings for `Do` or `SetGoroutineLabels`.
    
    Add notes to both of those functions' docstrings so it's clear that one
    does not need to set labels as soon as a new goroutine is spawned if
    they want to propagate tags.
