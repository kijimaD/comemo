    cmd/compile: remove now-irrelevant test
    
    This test measures "line churn" which was minimized to help
    improve the debugger experience.  With proper is_stmt markers,
    this is no longer necessary, and it is more accurate (for
    profiling) to allow line numbers to vary willy-nilly.
    
    "Debugger experience" is now better measured by
    cmd/compile/internal/ssa/debug_test.go
    
    This CL made the obsoleting change:
