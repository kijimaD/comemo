    cmd/asm: add s390x instructions BLTU and BLEU
    
    These instructions are the same as BLT and BLE except that they
    also branch if the 'unordered' bit is set in the condition code.
    
    They are already used by the SSA backend. This change allows them
    to be used in hand-written assembly code.
