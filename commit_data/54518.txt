    flag: clarify that the main func at pkg.go.dev is part of a testing suite
    
    flag.Example() has this comment:
    
        ... one must execute, typically at the start of main (not init!):
          flag.Parse()
        We don't run it here because this is not a main function
    
    This example function will be renamed to "main" at pkg.go.dev, which
    makes the comment confusing.
    See https://pkg.go.dev/flag#example-package.
    
    This change modify the comment to clarify this situation.
