    database/sql: document Stmt lifetime
    
    When prepared on a DB, prepared statement code in database/sql handles everything to keep the prepared statement alive as it moves across the connection pool. Understanding this is an important part of using this API correctly, but it was only documented indirectly via `(*Tx) Prepare*`.
