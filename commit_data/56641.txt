    cmd/cgo/internal/testcarchive: fix nocgo and no-c-archive builds
    
    CL 495918 enabled testcarchive much more widely and added many dynamic
    test skips. CL 495855 added TestDeepStack before these dynamic skips
    were in. Unfortunately, the two CLs don't logically commute, so when
    CL 495918 landed, it broke at least nocgo builders and platforms that
    don't support c-archive builds. Fix this by adding the necessary skips
    to TestDeepStack.
