    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: don't try to parse files in GOROOT/.git
    
    This test was failing locally in my clone of the go repo due to a Git
    branch ending in ".go", which the test found and was attempting to
    parse as a file. It's fragile to try to parse .go files in
    GOROOT/.git, and wasteful to scan GOROOT/pkg and other non-source
    directories; instead, let's only parse the directories we actually
    expect to contain source files.
    
    (I was running the test for #51461.)
