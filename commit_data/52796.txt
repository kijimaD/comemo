    crypto: use t.Parallel() to increase speed
    
    It is necessary to invoke the t.Parallel() method in both the top-level test function and its subtest function to maximize parallelism. In doing so, all subtest functions calling the t.Parallel() method in the package will work in parallel.
    
    On my machine, the execution time of this test file was cut in half.
