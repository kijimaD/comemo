    fmt: split package documentation into more sections
    
    The package-level documentation on fmt previously had only two formal
    sections, for printing and scanning. Because of this, the section on
    printing was very long, including some pseudo-sections describing
    particular features. This feature makes those pseudo-sections into
    proper sections, both to improve readability and so that those sections
    have hyperlinks on documentation sites.
    
    Fixes #46522
