    cmd/compile: only sort methods/interfaces during export for -d=unifiedquirks
    
    These sorts are only important for 'toolstash -cmp' testing of unified
    IR against -G=0 mode, but they were added before I added
    -d=unifiedquirks to allow altering small "don't care" output details
    like this.
    
    This CL should help mitigate issues with #44195 until package
    objectpath is updated and deployed.
