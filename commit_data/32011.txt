    cmd/link: disable mach-o dwarf munging with -w (in addition to -s)
    
    Might as well provide a way around the mach-o munging
    that doesn't require stripping all symbols.
    After all, -w does mean no DWARF.
    
    For #11887, #19734, and anyone else that needs to disable
    this code path without losing the symbol table.
