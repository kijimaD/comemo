    sync: add example for Pool
    
    It was a little tricky to figure out how to go from the documentation
    to figuring out the best way to implement a Pool, so I thought I'd
    try to provide a simple example. The implementation is mostly taken
    from the fmt package.
    
    I'm not happy with the verbosity of the calls to WriteString() etc,
    but I wanted to provide a non-trivial example.
