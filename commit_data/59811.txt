    internal/trace: improve gc-stress test
    
    The gc-stress test is useful for trying to exercise GC-related trace
    events by producing a lot of them in many different situations.
    Unfortunately this test is flaky, because allocating in a loop can
    easily out-run the GC when it's trying to preempt the allocating
    goroutine.
    
    It's been a long standing problem that a program that allocates in a
    loop can outrun a GC. The problem isn't the GC persay, it's consistently
    correlated with a high STW time (likely a high 'stopping' time, not a
    'stopped' time), suggesting that in the window of time when the garbage
    collector is trying to stop all goroutines, they continue to allocate.
    
    This should probably be fixed in general, but for now, let's focus on
    this flaky test.
    
    This CL changes the gc-stress test to (1) set a memory limit and (2) do
    more work in between allocations. (2) is really what makes things less
    flaky, but (2) unfortunately also means the GC is less exercised. That's
    where (1) comes in. By setting a low memory limit, we increase GC
    activity (in particular, assist activity). The memory limit also helps
    prevent the heap from totally blowing up due to the heap goal inflating
    from floating garbage, but it's not perfect.
    
    After this change, under stress2, this test exceeds a heap size of 500
    MiB only 1 in 5000 runs on my 64-vCPU VM. Before this change, it got
    that big about 1/4th of the time.
    
    Fixes #74052.
