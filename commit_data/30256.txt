    runtime: shade stack-to-stack copy when starting a goroutine
    
    The hybrid barrier requires barriers on stack-to-stack copies if
    either stack is grey. There are only two instances of this in the
    runtime: channel sends and starting a goroutine. Channel sends already
    use typedmemmove and hence have the necessary barriers. This commits
    adds barriers for the stack-to-stack copy when starting a goroutine.
    
    Updates #17503.
