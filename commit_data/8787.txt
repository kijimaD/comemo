    goinstall: Add support for arbitary code repositories
    
    Extend goinstall to support downloading from any hg/git/svn/bzr hosting
    site, not just the standard ones.  The type of hosting is automatically
    checked by trying all the tools, so the import statement looks like:
    
      import "example.com/mything"
    
    Which will work for Mercurial (http), Subversion (http, svn), Git (http,
    git) and Bazaar (http, bzr) hosting.
    
    All the existing package imports will work through this new mechanism,
    but the existing hard-coded host support is left in place to ensure
    there is no change in behaviour.
