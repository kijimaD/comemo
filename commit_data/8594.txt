    sync/atomic: fix check64
    
    The LDREXD and STREXD instructions require
    aligned addresses, and the ARM stack is not
    guaranteed to be aligned during the check.
    This may cause other problems later (on the ARM
    not all 64-bit pointers may be 64-bit aligned)
    but at least the check is correct now.
