    testing: reference benchmark format spec
    
    This updates the testing package documentation to reference the
    specification for the benchmark format, and points users to our
    standard tools for working with benchmark data. (It's somewhat
    remarkable how widely used benchstat appears to be given that we don't
    mention it anywhere!)
