    cmd/cgo: enable test with non-sensible build tag
    
    The build tag on this file is currently unsatisfiable. It was clearly
    supposed to be "linux || freebsd || openbsd", but the test doesn't
    actually compile on FreeBSD or OpenBSD because they don't define
    SYS_gettid. Change the build tag to just "linux".
