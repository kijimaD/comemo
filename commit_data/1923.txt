commit 4e8417481689214e388c3e978bf6af156e117de9
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>

    Separate the alignment of a field from the alignment of the
    type of the field.  Use the field alignment to compute the
    size of a structure.
    
    This may help 8g but is mainly for gccgo.  gccgo maintains the
    standard C/C++ ABI for structure field alignment.  For the
    i386, this requires that a float64 field in a struct be
    aligned on a 32-bit boundary, although for efficiency a
    variable of type float64 or []float64 should be aligned on a
    64-bit boundary.
    
    I also removed the unused size field from structField.
