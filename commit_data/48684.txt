    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: do extra markObjects during iexport to deal with generics
    
    markInlBody/markObject/markType don't fully work as they stand for
    generic functions/methods, since markInlBody can't understand method
    calls on generic types. Those method calls will be resolved to concrete
    methods in a full instantiation, but markInlBody on a generic
    function/method can't understand those method calls. So, we won't
    necessarily cause export of the appropriate extra method/function bodies
    needed for inlining in an instantiated function.
    
    One way to do this is just to make sure that we call markType
    on all generic types that are exported (whether explicitly exported via
    a capitalized name or unexported types that are referenced by a generic
    function body). That way, we will call markInlBody on all possible
    generic methods that might be called.
    
    Fixes the current problem for i386-softfloat builds on dev.typeparams.
