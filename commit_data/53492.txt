    cmd/dist: enable testsanitizer test on ppc64le
    
    Even though the -race option works for ppc64le, some of the
    testsanitizer test have failed in the past on our builders. These
    same failures can't be reproduced on other systems.
    
    This is an experiment to re-enable this test on ppc64le to see if
    it still fails on the builders.
    
    Updates #45040
