    cmd/dist: disable PGO for toolchain2 build
    
    Toolchain2 is only used for building toolchain3. We don't need to
    build it with PGO. And building with PGO causes packages to be
    built twice (one with PGO for the compiler, one without for other
    programs). Disable PGO for toolchain2.
    
    Also, I thought cmd/dist requires toolchain2 and toolchain3
    compilers are identical binaries, so they need to be built in the
    same way. But it doesn't.
