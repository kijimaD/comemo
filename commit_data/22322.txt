    doc/progs: rewrite test driver in Go
    
    The tests in doc/progs appear to have been originally written
    for use with the old test driver. At some later point,
    they acquired their own test driver.
    Both ran tests in serial.
    
    This CL rewrites the current test driver in Go,
    runs tests concurrently, and cleans up
    historical artifacts from the old drivers.
    
    The primary motivation is to speed up all.bash.
    On my laptop, using tip, this CL reduces doc/progs test
    wall time from 26s to 7s. The savings will remain
    even when the compiler gets faster. Using Go 1.4,
    this CL reduces test wall time from 15s to 4s.
