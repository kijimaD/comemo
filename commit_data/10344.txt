    exp/terminal: rename shell to terminal and add SetSize
    
    It was never really a shell, but the name carried
    over from SSH's ServerShell.
    
    Two small functional changes:
    
    Add SetSize, which allows the size of the terminal
    to be changed in response, say, to an SSH message.
    
    Don't write the prompt if there's already something
    on the current line.
