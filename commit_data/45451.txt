    cmd/gofmt: always format non-directory arguments again
    
    golang.org/cl/284138 introduced a regression: running "gofmt foo" would
    silently ignore the file due to its lack of a ".go" extension, whereas
    the tool is documented otherwise:
    
            Given a file, it operates on that file; given a directory, it
            operates on all .go files in that directory, recursively.
    
    This wasn't caught as there were no tests for these edge cases. gofmt's
    own tests are regular Go tests, so it's hard to test it properly without
    adding an abstraction layer on top of func main.
    
    Luckily, this kind of test is a great fit for cmd/go's own script tests,
    and it just takes a few straightforward lines.
    
    Finally, add the relevant logic back, with documentation to clarify its
    intentional purpose.
    
    Fixes #45859.
