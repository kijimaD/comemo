    runtime: improve comments for nextSample
    
    The previous comment of nextSample didn't mention Poisson processes,
    which is the reason why it needed to create an exponential
    distribution, so it was hard to follow the reasoning for people
    not highly familiar with statistics.
    
    Since we're at it, we also make it clear that we are just creating
    a random number with exponential distribution by moving the
    bulk of the function into a new fastexprand().
    
    No functional changes.
