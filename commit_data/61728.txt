    cmd/dist: vet non-test packages in short mode
    
    Pass all packages to go test, even if they don't have test files,
    so that go test can still run vet.
    
    I just got burned by a vet error in a package without a test
    showing up when I added an (unrelated) test.
    There are not enough packages without tests to be worth
    the "savings" of not letting the go command vet those packages.
    
    For #60463.
