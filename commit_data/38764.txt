    debug/pe: use kernel32.dll in TestImportTableInUnknownSection
    
    TestImportTableInUnknownSection was introduced in CL 110555 to
    test PE executable with import table located in section other than
    ".idata". We used atmfd.dll for that purpose, but it seems
    atmfd.dll is not present on some systems.
    
    Use kernel32.dll instead. kernel32.dll import table is located in
    ".rdata" section, so it should do the job. And every Windows
    system has kernel32.dll file.
    
    Also make TestImportTableInUnknownSection run on windows-arm,
    since windows-arm should also have kernel32.dll file.
    
    Updates #27904
