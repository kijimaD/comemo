    net/http: return error from Serve if http2.ConfigureServer returns an error
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/15860 http2.ConfigureServer was changed to
    return an error if explicit CipherSuites are listed and they're not
    compliant with the HTTP/2 spec.
    
    This is the net/http side of the change, to look at the return value
    from ConfigureServer and propagate it in Server.Serve.
    
    h2_bundle.go will be updated in a future CL. There are too many other
    http2 changes pending to be worth updating it now. Instead,
    h2_bundle.go is minimally updated by hand in this CL so at least the
    net/http change will compile.
    
    Updates #12895
