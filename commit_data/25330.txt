    cmd/go: don't be clever about mtime precision in test
    
    This doesn't happen enough in the tests to be worth debugging.
    Empirically, I expect this to add 5 seconds to the overall 'go test -short cmd/go'
    on systems with precise file systems, and nothing on systems without them
    (like my Mac).
    
    Fixes #12205.
