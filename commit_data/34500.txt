    runtime: buffered write barrier implementation
    
    This implements runtime support for buffered write barriers on amd64.
    The buffered write barrier has a fast path that simply enqueues
    pointers in a per-P buffer. Unlike the current write barrier, this
    fast path is *not* a normal Go call and does not require the compiler
    to spill general-purpose registers or put arguments on the stack. When
    the buffer fills up, the write barrier takes the slow path, which
    spills all general purpose registers and flushes the buffer. We don't
    allow safe-points or stack splits while this frame is active, so it
    doesn't matter that we have no type information for the spilled
    registers in this frame.
    
    One minor complication is cgocheck=2 mode, which uses the write
    barrier to detect Go pointers being written to non-Go memory. We
    obviously can't buffer this, so instead we set the buffer to its
    minimum size, forcing the write barrier into the slow path on every
    call. For this specific case, we pass additional information as
    arguments to the flush function. This also requires enabling the cgo
    write barrier slightly later during runtime initialization, after Ps
    (and the per-P write barrier buffers) have been initialized.
    
    The code in this CL is not yet active. The next CL will modify the
    compiler to generate calls to the new write barrier.
    
    This reduces the average cost of the write barrier by roughly a factor
    of 4, which will pay for the cost of having it enabled more of the
    time after we make the GC pacer less aggressive. (Benchmarks will be
    in the next CL.)
    
    Updates #14951.
    Updates #22460.
