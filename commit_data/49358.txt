    syscall: use correct type for TIOCSPGRP/TIOCGPGRP
    
    These ioctls take a pid_t (generally a C integer aka int32) and not an int64 - we
    currently get away with this on little endian 64 bit platforms, since the bytes
    fall into the correct place, however this breaks on big endian 64 bit platforms
    (like openbsd/mips64).
    
    This is the same fix as CL 267605, however for libc based exec.
    
    Updates #36435
