    runtime: eliminate write barriers from dropg
    
    Currently this contains no write barriers because it's writing nil
    pointers, but with the hybrid barrier, even these will produce write
    barriers. However, since these are *gs and *ms, they don't need write
    barriers, so we can simply eliminate them.
    
    Updates #17503.
