commit 0f29942489409ccd81619b5f82fce9c7de18165f

    cmd/compile: Repurpose old sliceopt.go for prove phase.
    
    Adapt old test for prove's bounds check elimination.
    Added missing rule to generic rules that lead to differences
    between 32 and 64 bit platforms on sliceopt test.
    Added debugging to prove.go that was helpful-to-necessary to
    discover that missing rule.
    Lowered debugging level on prove.go from 3 to 1; no idea
    why it was previously 3.
