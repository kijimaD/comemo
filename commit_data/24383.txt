    runtime: always report starting heap size in gctrace
    
    Currently the gctrace output reports the trigger heap size, rather
    than the actual heap size at the beginning of GC. Often these are the
    same, or at least very close. However, it's possible for the heap to
    already have exceeded this trigger when we first check the trigger and
    start GC; in this case, this output is very misleading. We've
    encountered this confusion a few times when debugging and this
    behavior is difficult to document succinctly.
    
    Change the gctrace output to report the actual heap size when GC
    starts, rather than the trigger.
