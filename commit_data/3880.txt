commit 1ac60ddd1020026fe184273d0e1b6aeb731e946a

    - support to extract one-line package synopsis for package listings
    - formatting in dirs.html is crude, needs better html (open to suggestions),
      but shows the synopsis
    - many package comments should probably be adjusted such that the first
      sentence is more concise
