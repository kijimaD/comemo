    net: ignore network failures on some builders
    
    We run the external network tests on builders, but some of our
    builders have less-than-ideal DNS connectivity. This change continues
    to run the tests on all builders, but marks certain builders as flaky
    (network-wise), and only validates their DNS results if they got DNS
    results.
