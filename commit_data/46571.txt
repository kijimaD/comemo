    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: implement a more robust mutator
    
    This change also allocates a larger capacity (100 MB) for the shared
    memory at the start, rather than beginning as small as possible and
    immediately needing to grow while mutating. This means that 100 MB is
    the maximum size of a corpus entry currently, since growing the shared
    memory is not yet supported.
    
    The code in internal/fuzz/mutator.go and internal/fuzz/pcg.go are copied
    from, or heavily inspired by, code originally authored by Dmitry Vyukov
    and Josh Bleecher Snyder as part of the go-fuzz project. Thanks to them
    for their contributions. See https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz.
