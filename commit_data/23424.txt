    cmd/internal/obj: validate GOARM environment variable's value before use
    
    I was previously setting GOARM=arm5 (due to confusion with previously
    seeing buildall.sh's temporary of "arm5" as a GOARCH and
    misremembernig), but GOARM=arm5 was acting like GOARM=5 only on
    accident. See https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/10023/
    
    Instead, fail if GOARM is not a known value.
