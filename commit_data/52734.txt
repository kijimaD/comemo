    cmd/cgo: allow DW_TAG_variable's with no name
    
    https://reviews.llvm.org/D123534 is emitting DW_TAG_variable's
    that don't have a DW_AT_name. This is allowed in the DWARF
    standard. It is adding DIE's for string literals for better
    symbolization on buffer overlows etc on these strings. They
    no associated name because they are not user provided variables.
    
    Fixes #53000
