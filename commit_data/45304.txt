    cmd/compile: escape "go" wrapper closure everywhere
    
    For go statement, the wrapper closure needs to esacpe because it
    runs asynchronously. Currently, it is not allowed for closures to
    escape in the runtime. We have worked around this in the runtime,
    so it doesn't "go" any function with arguments and so doesn't
    need wrapping. If it ever does, it is not that we can have the
    closure not escape, which may lead to miscompilation. Instead,
    make the closure escape (which will fail the compilation). In the
    future we may allow go'd closure to escape in the runtime.
