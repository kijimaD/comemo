    test: relax whitespaces matching in codegen tests
    
    The codegen testsuite uses regexp to parse the syntax, but it doesn't
    have a way to tell line comments containing checks from line comments
    containing English sentences. This means that any syntax error (that
    is, non-matching regexp) is currently ignored and not reported.
    
    There were some tests in memcombine.go that had an extraneous space
    and were thus effectively disabled. It would be great if we could
    report it as a syntax error, but for now we just punt and swallow the
    spaces as a workaround, to avoid the same mistake again.
    
    Fixes #25452
