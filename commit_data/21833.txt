    cmd/dist: fix default GOOS/GOARCH for cross-compile
    
    Before this CL, if you are on a darwin/amd64 machine and
    cross-compile 9g for a linux/ppc64 machine, when you copy
    9g over to that kind of machine and run it, you'll find it thinks
    the default object target is darwin/amd64. Not useful.
    Make the default target linux/ppc64 in this case. More useful.
