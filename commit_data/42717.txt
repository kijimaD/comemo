    [dev.link] cmd/link: don't read symbol name if not needed
    
    Most of the time of goobj2.Sym.Read is spent in reading the
    symbol name. Sometimes the name is not needed, so don't read
    it.
    
    This brings the linking time pretty much back to the old linker.
    On my Mac,
    
    $ time go build cmd/compile     # (new)
    
    real    0m1.016s
    user    0m1.164s
    sys     0m0.297s
    
    $ time go-tip build cmd/compile # (old)
    
    real    0m0.980s
    user    0m1.229s
    sys     0m0.309s
    
    Again, this is a bit ugly. Maybe we want to consider moving
    symbol names out of Sym, to a separate section of the object
    file?
