    cmd/go: reject toolchain directives containing path separators
    
    If GOTOOLCHAIN="path" or "auto", the go command uses exec.LookPath to
    search for it in order to allow toolchains to refer to local-only
    toolchain variants (such as toolchains built from enterprise- or
    distro-patched source). However, those toolchains should only be
    resolved from $PATH, not relative to the working directory of the
    command.
    
    Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.
    
    Fixes #62198.
    Fixes CVE-2023-39320.
