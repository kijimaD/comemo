    cmd/link/internal/ld: split TestInlinedRoutineRecords
    
    A later CL will add additional test cases for CallFile and CallLine with
    a //line directive. The parameter/variable checks have nothing to do
    with line numbers and will only serve to make the test more difficult to
    follow, so split this single mega-test into two: one for testing
    file/line and the other for testing parameters/variables.
    
    There are a few additional minor changes:
    
    1. A missing AttrName is now an error.
    2. Check added for AttrCallLine, which was previously untested.
    
    For #58648.
