    misc/ios: improve detection of missing developer image
    
    It turns out that a non-empty result from ideviceimagemounter does
    not mean an image is mounted. Use ideviceimagemounter's xml output
    mode to improve the check.
    
    Also, iOS versions are reported as major.minor or major.minor.patch.
    Developer images are only specific to major.minor version, so cut
    off the patch number in the search, if present.
