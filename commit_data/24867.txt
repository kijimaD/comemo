    cmd/compile: use []*Node instead of NodeList in bottomUpVisitor
    
    This one of a set of changes to make the transition away from NodeList
    easier by removing cases in which NodeList doesn't act semi-trivially like a
    []*Node.
    
    This CL was originally prepared by Josh Bleecher Snyder <josharian@gmail.com>.
    
    This change passes go build -toolexec 'toolstash -cmp' -a std.
