    cmd/go: delete testdata/testonly dir: it isn't being used anywhere
    
    The TestGoBuildTestOnly test seems to be using files in testonly,
    but it's actually creating different files in a tempdir GOPATH
    that are completely unrelated.
    
    Part of converting all tests to script framework to improve
    test parallelism.
