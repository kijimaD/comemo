    time: make time.Since a few nanoseconds faster
    
    time.Since(base) is an idiom that can be used to read the system
    monotonic time as efficiently as possible, when that matters.
    The current code structure adds a few nanoseconds on top of
    the 15-20ns the time read already takes. Remove those few.
    
    After this CL, there is no reason at all for anyone to
    //go:linkname runtime.nanotime1 instead.
    
    Came up while investigating #61765.
