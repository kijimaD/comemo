    cmd/link/internal/ld: disable execute-only for external linking on openbsd/arm64
    
    The Go arm64 assembler places constants into the text section of a binary.
    OpenBSD 7.3 enabled xonly by default on OpenBSD/arm64. This means that any
    externally linked Go binary now segfaults. Disable execute-only when invoking
    the external linker on openbsd/arm64, in order to work around this issue.
    
    Updates #59615
