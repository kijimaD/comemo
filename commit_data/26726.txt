    cmd/vet: add a check for tests with malformed names
    
    According to golang.org/pkg/testing the first character after Test has
    to be non-lowercase. Functions that don't conform to this are not
    considered tests and are not loaded which can cause surprises.
    
    This change adds a check to warn about Test-like functions in a _test
    file that are not actually run by go test.
