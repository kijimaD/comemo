    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: generate float 0 more efficiently on ppc64x
    
    This change makes use of a VSX instruction to generate the
    float 0 value instead of generating a constant in memory and
    loading it from there.
    
    This uses 1 instruction instead of 2 and avoids a memory reference.
    in the +0 case, uses 2 instructions in the -0 case but avoids
    the memory reference.
    
    Since this is done in the assembler for ppc64x, an update has
    been made to the assembler test.
