    runtime, time: refactor startNano handling
    
    Move startNano from runtime to time package.
    In preparation for a subsequent change that speeds up Since and Until.
    This also makes code simpler as we have less assembly as the result,
    monotonic time handling is better localized in time package.
    This changes values returned from nanotime on windows
    (it does not account for startNano anymore), current comments state
    that it's important, but it's unclear how it can be important
    since no other OS does this.
    
    Update #25729
