    cmd/link, runtime: use a different section for Go libfuzzer counters
    
    Currently in libfuzzer mode, we put our counters in section
    __sancov_cntrs. When linking with C/C++ code that also has fuzzer
    counters, apparently the C linker combines our counters and their
    counters and registers them together. But in the Go runtime we
    also have code to register our counters. So the Go counters ended
    up registered twice, causing problems.
    
    Since we already have code to register our counters, put them in
    a Go-specific section so it won't be combined with the C counters.
    
    Fixes #57449.
