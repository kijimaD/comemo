    cmd/compile: rewrite empty makeslice to zerobase pointer
    
    make\(\[\][a-zA-Z0-9]+, 0\) is seen 52 times in the go source.
    And at least 391 times on internet:
    https://grep.app/search?q=make%5C%28%5C%5B%5C%5D%5Ba-zA-Z0-9%5D%2B%2C%200%5C%29&regexp=true
    This used to compile to calling runtime.makeslice.
    However we can copy what we do for []T{}, just use a zerobase pointer.
    
    On my machine this is 10x faster (from 3ns to 0.3ns).
    Note that an empty loop also runs in 0.3ns,
    so this really is free when you count superscallar execution.
