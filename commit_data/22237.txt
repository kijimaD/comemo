    runtime: change sigset_all and sigset_none into constants on OpenBSD
    
    OpenBSD's sigprocmask system call passes the signal mask by value
    rather than reference, so vars are unnecessary.  Additionally,
    declaring "var sigset_all = ^sigset_none" means sigset_all won't be
    initialized until runtime_init is called, but the first call to
    newosproc happens before then.
    
    I've witnessed Go processes on OpenBSD crash from receiving SIGWINCH
    on the newly created OS thread before it finished initializing.
