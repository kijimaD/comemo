    encoding/json: take new decoder code off Decode path completely
    
    The new Token API is meant to sit on the side of the Decoder,
    so that you only get the new code (and any latent bugs in it)
    if you are actively using the Token API.
    
    The unconditional use of dec.peek in dec.tokenPrepareForDecode
    violates that intention.
    
    Change tokenPrepareForDecode not to call dec.peek unless needed
    (because the Token API has advanced the state).
    This restores the old code path behavior, no peeking allowed.
    
    I checked by patching in the new tests from CL 12726 that
    this change suffices to "fix" the error handling bug in dec.peek.
    Obviously that bug should be fixed too, but the point is that
    with this CL, bugs in dec.peek do not affect plain use of Decode
    or Unmarshal.
    
    I also checked by putting a panic in dec.peek that the only
    tests that now invoke peek are:
    
            TestDecodeInStream
            ExampleDecoder_Token
            ExampleDecoder_Decode_stream
    
    and those tests all invoke dec.Token directly.
