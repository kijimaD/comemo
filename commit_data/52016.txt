    debug/pe: add APIs for reading section def aux info
    
    Add hooks to support reading of section definition symbol aux data
    (including COMDAT information) from the aux symbols associated with
    section definition symbols. The COFF symbol array made available by
    "pe.File" includes entries for aux symbols, but doesn't expose their
    structure (since it varies depending on the type of aux symbol). This
    patch adds a function for returning a specific class of aux symbol
    ("type 5") that immediately follows a COFF symbol corresponding to a
    section definition.
    
    Updates #35006.
    Updates #51868.
