    cmd/internal/objfile: read file/line information for ELF PIE binaries
    
    For PIE binaries, the .gopclntab section doesn't have the usual
    name, but .data.rel.ro.gopclntab. Try the relro version as well.
    If both failed (e.g. for externally linked PIE binaries), try
    runtime.pclntab symbol.
    
    This should make cmd/objdump able to print the file/line
    information for PIE binaries.
    
    I attempted to do this a few years ago, but that wasn't enough,
    because the pclntab itself contains dynamic relocations which are
    not applied by the tool. As of Go 1.18 the pclntab is mostly
    position independent and does not contain dynamic relocations, so
    this should be possible now.
    
    Fixes #17883.
    Updates #46639.
