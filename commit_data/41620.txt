    [dev.link] cmd/link/internal/objfile: relocate loader to new package
    
    Third change of several to update the loader API to reflect the final
    consensus version of the loader API as described in Cherry's doc.
    This piece:
    
       - move objfile.Loader into its own separate package, and update
         clients accordingly.
    
    This includes a few minor cleanups, including converting a couple
    of loader-related functions to methods, and privatizing some of the
    loader methods such as ToGlobal/ToLocal.
