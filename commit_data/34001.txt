    spec: remove example explaining that type B0 and B0 are identical
    
    Every few months we get a new error report claiming that there
    is a typo in the spec related to this specific example. Clearly,
    the fact that two types with the same identifier are identical
    seems exceedingly obvious to readers; thus the example seems not
    worth the trouble. Removing it.
    
    For #9226.
    For #22202.
    For #22495.
    For #23096.
    For #23409.
    
    There may be more.
