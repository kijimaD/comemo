    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: don't use REGTMP when moving C_AACON2 to a register
    
    MOVD $C_AACON2(Rf), Rt is encoded as ADD $C_AACON2_high_12_bits, Rf, REGTMP +
    ADD $C_AACON2_low_12_bits, REGTMP, Rt. Actually REGTMP is not necessary here,
    we can use Rt directly, so it becomes ADD $C_AACON2_high_12_bits, Rf, Rt +
    ADD $C_AACON2_low_12_bits, Rt, Rt.
