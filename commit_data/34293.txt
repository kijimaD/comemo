    fmt: clarify wording of * flag
    
    The complainant is confused by the ambiguity of 'next' in the
    phrase 'next operand'. It seems clear enough to me that things
    are always read left to right when formatting, but to calm the
    waters we add a clarifying parenthetical.
    
    Fixes #22275
