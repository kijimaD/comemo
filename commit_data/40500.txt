    cmd/link/internal/ld: remove flags incompatible with -fembed-bitcode
    
    The flags -headerpad, -Wl,-no_pie and -pagezero_size are incompatible with
    the -fembed-bitcode flag used by `gomobile build`. Than McIntosh
    suggested we might not need the offending flags; this change removes
    the flags on darwin/arm64 and -headerpad, -pagezero_size on darwin/arm.
    
    The -Wl,-no_pie flag is left for darwin/arm because linking fails
    without it:
    
    ld: warning: PIE disabled. Absolute addressing (perhaps -mdynamic-no-pic) not allowed in code signed PIE, but used in _runtime.rodata from /var/folders/qq/qxn86k813bn9fjxydm095rxw0000gp/T/workdir-host-darwin-amd64-zenly-ios/tmp/go-link-225285265/go.o. To fix this warning, don't compile with -mdynamic-no-pic or link with -Wl,-no_pie

    I've verified the CL on the builders, built the "flappy" example from
    gomobile with `gomobile build`, and verified that flappy runs on an
    iPhone 5S.
