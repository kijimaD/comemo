    runtime: avoid divide-by-zero in GC trigger controller
    
    The trigger controller computes GC CPU utilization by dividing by the
    wall-clock time that's passed since concurrent mark began. Since this
    delta is nanoseconds it's borderline impossible for it to be zero, but
    if it is zero we'll currently divide by zero. Be robust to this
    possibility by ignoring the utilization in the error term if no time
    has elapsed.
