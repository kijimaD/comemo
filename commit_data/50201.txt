    runtime: handle end PC in textAddr
    
    As the func table contains the end marker of the text section, we
    sometimes need to get that address from an offset. Currently
    textAddr doesn't handle that address, as it is not within any
    text section. Instead of letting the callers not call textAddr
    with the end offset, just handle it more elegantly in textAddr.
    
    For #48837.
