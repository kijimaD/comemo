    cmd/go: make sure the linker for shared doesn't include tempdir path
    
    This is similar to CL 478196 and CL 477296,
    but this is for -buildmode=shared.
    
    When using "go install -buildmode=shared std",
    because the gold linker is used by default on Linux arm64,
    it will cause temporary paths to be included in libstd.so.
    
    Based on the changes of CL 478196,
    I speculate that this may also have issues on other platforms.
    So, this change is for all platform.
    
    Fixes #69464
