    cmd/go: fix two bugs
    
    Issue 3207 was caused by setting GOPATH=GOROOT.
    This is a common mistake, so diagnose it at command start
    and also correct the bug that it caused in get (downloading
    to GOROOT/src/foo instead of GOROOT/src/pkg/foo).
    
    Issue 3268 was caused by recognizing 'packages' that
    had installed binaries but no source.  This behavior is not
    documented and causes trouble, so remove it.  We can
    revisit the concept of binary-only packages after Go 1.
    
    Fixes #3207.
    Fixes #3268.
