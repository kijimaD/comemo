    cmd/compile: avoid compressed dwarf when testing for gdb on OSX
    
    Until we figure out how to deal with gdb on Darwin (doesn't
    read compressed DWARF from binaries), avoid compressing
    DWARF in that case so that the test will still yield meaningful
    results.
    
    This is also reported to be a problem for Windows.
    
    Problem also exists for lldb, but this test doesn't check
    lldb.
    
    Updates #25925
