+The [Read] function, and the `Read` method of [Reader], are now
+defined to never fail.
+They will always return `nil` as the `error` result.
+If something somehow goes wrong while reading random numbers,
+the program will irrecoverably crash.
+This change was made because all supported systems now provide
+sources of random bytes that never fail.
