    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile/internal/importer: review of gcimporter.go
    
    This CL removes the // UNREVIEWED disclaimer at the top of the
    file. This file is essentially a copy of its reviewed version
    at src/go/internal/gcimporter/gcimporter.go with adjustments to
    make it work for the compiler and types2. To see the changes
    made with respect to the original, compare patchset 1 against
    patchset 2.
