    cmd/go/internal/par: fix TestWorkParallel retries
    
    When the test retried multiple times, it reused the same Work variable,
    causing in the builders being flaky due to panics. I was able to
    immediately reproduce the failure with stress and -race:
    
            $ go test -race -c && stress -p 32 ./par.test -test.run=TestWorkParallel$
    
            /tmp/go-stress909062277
            --- FAIL: TestWorkParallel (0.07s)
            panic: par.Work.Do: already called Do [recovered]
                    panic: par.Work.Do: already called Do
    
    Instead, use a new Work variable at each retry. Now, the line above
    seems to never fail. Of course, much higher 'stress -p' values will
    still result in "does not seem to be parallel" test failures since the
    machine lacks resources. But those are test failures, not panics.
    
    Fixes #26642.
