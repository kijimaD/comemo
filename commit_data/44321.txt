    run.bat: do not unset GOROOT_FINAL before running tests
    
    This removes the same logic from run.bat that was removed from
    cmd/dist in CL 236819.
    
    The duplicated logic was removed from run.bash and run.rc in CL 6531,
    but that part of run.bat was apparently missed (and not noticed
    because its effect was redundant).
    
    Also fix a path-separator bug in cmd/addr2line.TestAddr2Line that was
    exposed as a result.
    
    Fixes #39478
    Updates #39385
