    net: avoid use of listener socket options on active open sockets
    
    This CL ensures we use the correct socket options for
    passive and active open sockets.
    
    For the passive open sockets created by Listen functions,
    additional SO_REUSEADDR, SO_REUSEPORT options are required
    for the quick service restart and/or multicasting.
    
    For the active open sockets created by Dial functions, no
    additional options are required.
