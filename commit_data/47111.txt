    cmd/compile/internal-abi: update internal ABI spec for g register
    
    We've already implemented dedicating R14 as the G register on amd64,
    so remove the TODO saying we might want to hold off on this.
    
    For #40724.

 | X15 | Zero value | Fixed |
 
-TODO: We may start with the existing TLS-based g and move to R14
-later.

 *Rationale*: These register meanings are compatible with Goâ€™s
 stack-based calling convention except for R14 and X15, which will have
 to be restored on transitions from ABI0 code to ABIInternal code.
