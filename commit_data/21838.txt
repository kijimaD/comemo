commit 190357d560b2bf4421c1819ebb9afe7aa175785c

    cmd/dist, cmd/go: move textdata.h, funcdata.h from pkg/GOOS_GOARCH to pkg/include
    
    There's no point to having them in every GOOS_GOARCH directory,
    since they are neither GOOS- nor GOARCH-specific.
    (There used to be other headers that were.)
    
    This makes building for additional toolchains easier:
    no need to run make.bash at all.
    
    Fixes #10049.
