    regexp: add Split
    
    As discussed in issue 2672 and on golang-nuts, this CL adds a Split() method
    to regexp. It is based on returning the "opposite" of FindAllString() so that
    the returned substrings are everything not matched by the expression.
    
    See: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/xodBZh9Lh2E
    
    Fixes #2762.
