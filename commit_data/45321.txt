    io/fs: add FS, File, ReadDirFile; move DirEntry from os
    
    These are the core interfaces for the io/fs design.
    See #41190 and https://golang.org/s/draft-iofs-design for details.
    
    DirEntry was left behind in the previous move from os
    but is needed for ReadDirFile, so it moves in this commit.
    
    Also apply a couple comment changes suggested in
    the review of CL 261540.
    
    For #41190.
