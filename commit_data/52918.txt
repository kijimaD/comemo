    runtime: remove TestCrashExitCode
    
    TestCrashExitCode was added in CL 491935 to test that the exit code
    is honored when using GOTRACEBACK=crash, which is what normally happens
    on a stock Windows. The problem is that some applications (not only WER,
    as I incorrectly assumed in CL 491935) can hijack a crashing process
    and change its exit code.
    
    There is no way to tell if a crashing process using GOTRACEBACK=crash/
    wer will have its error code hijacked, so we better don't test this
    behavior, which in fact is not documented by the Go runtime.
