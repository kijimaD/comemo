commit 50ca1a52ca39bdd76bb5f999a67450f5984ebba2
Author: Nigel Tao <nigeltao@golang.org>

    database/sql: add "defer rows.Close()" to the example code.
    
    Strictly speaking, it's not necessary in example_test.go, as the
    Rows.Close docs say that "If Next returns false, the Rows are closed
    automatically". However, if the for loop breaks or returns early, it's
    not obvious that you'll leak unless you explicitly call Rows.Close.
