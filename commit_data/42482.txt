    cmd/link: skip symbol references when looking for missing symbols
    
    ErrorUnresolved attempts to find the missing symbol in another ABI,
    in order to provide more friendly error messages. However, in doing so
    it checks the same ABI and can find the symbol reference for the symbol
    that it is currently reporting the unresolved error for. Avoid this by
    ignoring SXREF symbols, which is the same behaviour used when linking
    is performed.
    
    Fixes #33979
