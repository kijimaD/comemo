    database/sql: add context helper methods and transaction types
    
    Prior to this change, it was implied that transaction properties
    would be carried in the context value. However, no such properties
    were defined, not even common ones. Define two common properties:
    isolation level and read-only. Drivers may choose to support
    additional transaction properties. It is not expected any
    further transaction properties will be added in the future.
