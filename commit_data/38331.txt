    cmd/compile: update TestIntendedInlining
    
    Value.CanInterface and Value.pointer are now inlinable, since we have a
    limited form of mid-stack inlining. Their calls to panic were preventing
    that in previous Go releases. The other three methods still go over
    budget, so update that comment.
    
    In recent commits, sync.Once.Do and multiple lock/unlock methods have
    also been made inlinable, so add those as well. They have standalone
    tests like test/inline_sync.go already, but it's best if the funcs are
    in this global test table too. They aren't inlinable on every platform
    yet, though.
    
    Finally, use math/bits.UintSize to check if GOARCH is 64-bit, now that
    we can.
