    testing/slogtest: check for no group with empty record
    
    As #61067 pointed out, slog did not properly handle empty groups.
    https://go.dev/cl/508436 dealt with most cases inside slog itself,
    but handlers must still do a check on their own. Namely, a handler
    must not output a group created by WithGroup unless the Record
    has attributes.
    
    This change adds a test to slogtest to check that case.
    
    Fixes #61227.
