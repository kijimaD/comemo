    cmd/compile: use a sync.Pool and string interning when printing types
    
    CL 214239 improved type printing, but introduced performance regressions:
    3-5% memory increase, 1-2% CPU time increase.
    
    There were two primary sources of the memory regression:
    
    * allocating a bytes.Buffer for every type to print
    * always printing to that buffer, even when we could return a constant string
    
    This change addresses both of those regressions.
    The sync.Pool allows buffer re-use.
    String interning prevents allocation for re-used strings.
    
    It addresses some, but not all, of the CPU time regression.
    
    
    Memory performance impact vs master:
