    runtime: remove incorrect TODO added in CL 16035
    
    I've already turned away one attempt to remove this field.
    As the comment above the struct says, many tools know the layout.
    The field cannot simply be removed.
    
    It was one thing to remove the fields name, but the TODO should
    not have been added.
