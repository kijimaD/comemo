    log: make Default doc comment consistent with package doc
    
    None of the other, older, doc comments use the '*Logger' form, and while
    'Logger' and 'logger' are both used in the package doc comment, the
    common term used with the intended meaning is 'standard logger', which
    appears another eleven times in doc comments.
