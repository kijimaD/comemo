    cmd/internal/obj/arm: fix encoding of move register/immediate to CPSR
    
    "MOVW R1, CPSR" is assembled to 0xe129f001, which should be 0xe12cf001.
    "MOVW $255, CPSR" is assembled to 0xe329f0ff, which should be 0xe32cf0ff.
    
    This patch fixes them and adds more assembly encoding tests.
    
    fix #20626
