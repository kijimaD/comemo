    runtime: do not treat asmcgocall as a topofstack on g0
    
    This was added in 2018 to fix a runtime crash during unwind
    during a unhandled-panic-induced crash.
    (See https://golang.org/cl/90895 and #23576.)
    Clearly we cannot unwind past this function, and the change
    did stop the unwind. But it's not a top-of-stack function, and
    the real issue is that SP is changed.
    
    The new SPWRITE bit takes care of this instead, so we can drop
    it from the topofstack function.
    
    At this point the topofstack function is only checking the
    TOPFRAME bit, so we can inline that into the one call site.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
