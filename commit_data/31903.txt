    encoding/ascii85: make bigtest big again
    
    ascii85_test.go contains a variable called bigtest that is used as
    test data for TestDecoderBuffering and TestEncoderBuffering.  The
    variable is initialised to a copy of the last element of the pairs
    slice.  When the variable was first added the last element of this
    slice contained a sizable test case, 342 encoded characters.  However,
    https://golang.org/cl/5970078 added a new element to the end of the pairs
    slice without updating bigtest.  As the new element contained only 1 byte
    of encoded data bigtest became very small test.  This commit fixes the
    problem by resetting bigtest to its original value and making its
    initialisation independent of the layout of pairs.  All the unit tests
    still pass.
