    go/types: process each segment of delayed actions in FIFO order
    
    The stack of delayed actions is grown by pushing a new action
    on top with Checker.later. Checker.processDelayed processes
    all actions above a top watermark and then resets the stack
    to top.
    
    Until now, pushed actions above the watermark were processed
    in LIFO order. This change processes them in FIFO order, which
    seems more natural (if an action A was delayed before an action
    B, A should be processed before B for that stack segment).
    
    (With this change, Checker.later could be used instead of
    Checker.atEnd to postpone interface method type comparison
    and then the specific example in issue #33656 does type-check.
    However, in general we want interface method type comparisons
    to run after all interfaces are completed. With Checker.later
    we may still end up mixing interface completions and interface
    method type comparisons in ways leading to other errors for
    sufficiently convoluted code.)
    
    Also, move Checker.processDelayed from resolver.go to check.go.
