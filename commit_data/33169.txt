    cmd/go: skip updateBuildID on binaries we will run
    
    On modern Unix systems it is basically impossible for a multithreaded
    program to open a binary for write, close it, and then fork+exec that
    same binary. So don't write the binary if we're going to fork+exec it.
    
    This fixes the ETXTBSY flakes.
    
    Fixes #22220.
    See also #22315.
