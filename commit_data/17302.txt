    net: limit number of concurrent cgo calls
    
    The limit is 500. There is no way to change it.
    This primarily affects name resolution.
    If a million goroutines try to resolve DNS names,
    only 500 will get to execute cgo calls at a time.
    But in return the operating system will not crash.
    
    Fixes #5625.
