    runtime: add new adjusttimers function
    
    The adjusttimers function is where we check the adjustTimers field in
    the P struct to see if we need to resort the heap. We walk forward in
    the heap and find and resort timers that have been modified, until we
    find all the timers that were modified to run earlier. Along the way
    we remove deleted timers.
