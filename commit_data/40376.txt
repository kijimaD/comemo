    cmd/link: write memprofile in legacy format for compilebench
    
    compilebench depends on the legacy heap profile format to read the
    allocation stats of build tools. We're adding a benchmark for the
    linker to compilebench, so we need the linker to emit the heap profile
    in the legacy format.
    
    This is the linker equivalent of CL 35484, which did this for the
    compiler.
