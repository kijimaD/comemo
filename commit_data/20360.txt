    runtime: Start and stop individual goroutines at gc safepoints
    
    Code to bring goroutines to a gc safepoint one at a time,
    do some work such as scanning, and restart the
    goroutine, and then move on to the next goroutine.
    Currently this code does not do much useful work
    but this infrastructure will be critical to future
    concurrent GC work.
    
    Fixed comments reviewers.
