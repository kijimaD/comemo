    cmd/link: revise test case to work on pre-10.14 macos
    
    Rework this recently introduced test case to insure that it works with
    older versions of the OS. It was using a new framework library not
    available on pre-10.14 to trigger the weak symbol reference; switch to
    using a new symbol from an existing library. Tested on MacOS 10.14 and
    10.11.
    
    Updates #32233.
