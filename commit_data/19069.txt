    runtime: cache gotraceback setting
    
    On Plan 9 gotraceback calls getenv calls malloc, and we gotraceback
    on every call to gentraceback, which happens during garbage collection.
    Honestly I don't even know how this works on Plan 9.
    I suspect it does not, and that we are getting by because
    no one has tried to run with $GOTRACEBACK set at all.
    
    This will speed up all the other systems by epsilon, since they
    won't call getenv and atoi repeatedly.
