    cmd/go: consistently use DefaultExecName for executable name
    
    go tool, go run, and the executable caching logic have all used
    path.Base of a package's import path to set the name of the executable
    produced. But the base name for a package name that's the same as a
    module name ending in a major version is just that major version, which
    is not very useful. For go build and go install, we use
    load.DefaultExecName as the name of the binary which will select the
    second to last element of the import path as the name of the executable
    produced. This change changes go tool, go run, and the executable
    caching logic to all use DefaultExecName consistently to pick the name
    of the executable.
