    cmd/internal/obj/{ppc64,s390x}: mark functions with small stacks NOSPLIT
    
    This change omits the stack check on ppc64 and s390x when the size of
    a stack frame is less than obj.StackSmall. This is an optimization
    x86 already performs.
    
    The effect on s390x isn't huge because we were already omitting the
    stack check when the frame size was 0 (it shaves about 1K from the
    size of bin/go). On ppc64 however this change reduces the size of the
    .text section in bin/go by 33K (1%).
    
    Updates #13379 (for ppc64).
