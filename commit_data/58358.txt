    encoding/base64, encoding/base32: add doc details to DecodeString and AppendDecode
    
    Currently only Encoding.Decode has the information that `\r` and
    `\n` are ignored. However, this also applies to the other decoding
    methods. Since this is not intuitive behavior, we should add this
    information to the other impacted methods.
