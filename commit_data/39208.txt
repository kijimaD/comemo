    cmd/compile: clarify the difference between types.Sym and obj.LSym
    
    Both types.Sym and obj.LSym have the field Name, and that field is
    widely used in compiler source. It can lead to confusion that when to
    use which one.
    
    So, adding documentation for clarifying the difference between them,
    eliminate the confusion, or at least, make the code which use them
    clearer for the reader.
