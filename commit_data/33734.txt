    cmd/link: emit DW_AT_data_member_location as a constant
    
    Simplify the DWARF representation of structs by emitting field offsets
    as constants rather than location descriptions.
    
    This was not explicitly mentioned as an option in DWARF2. It is
    mentioned in DWARF4, but isn't listed in the changes, so it's not clear
    if this was always intended to work or is an undocumented change. Either
    way, it should be valid DWARF4.
