    runtime/race: test that close synchronizes with read
    
    Add a test to ensure that the race detector sees that closing a
    channel synchronizes with a read from that channel.
    This test case failed when CL 181543 was in the tree.
    CL 181543 was reverted in CL 216158; this adds a test to make
    sure that we don't re-introduce the problem at a later date.
    
    For #32529
    For #36714
