    text/scanner: don't allow Float exponents with no mantissa
    
    Previously Scanner would allow float literals like "1.5e" and "1e+"
    that weren't actually valid Go float literals, and also not valid
    when passed to ParseFloat. This commit fixes that behaviour to match
    the documentation ("recognizes all literals as defined by the Go
    language specification"), and Scanner emits an error in these cases.
    
    Fixes #26374
