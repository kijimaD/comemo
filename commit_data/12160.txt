+<pre>
+This weekly snapshot includes changes to the os and runtime packages.
+
+This should be the last of the significant incompatible changes before Go 1.
+
+There are no longer error constants such as EINVAL in the os package, since the
+set of values varied with the underlying operating system. There are new
+portable functions like IsPermission to test common error properties, plus a
+few new error values with more Go-like names, such as ErrPermission and
+ErrNoEnv.
+
+The os.Getenverror function has been removed. To distinguish between a
+non-existent environment variable and an empty string, use os.Environ or
+syscall.Getenv.
+
+The Process.Wait method has dropped its option argument and the associated
+constants are gone from the package. Also, the function Wait is gone; only the
+method of the Process type persists.
+
+The non-portable Waitmsg type has been replaced with the portable ProcessState.
+
+Much of the API exported by package runtime has been removed in favor of
+functionality provided by other packages. Code using the runtime.Type
+interface or its specific concrete type implementations should now use package
+reflect.  Code using runtime.Semacquire or runtime.Semrelease should use
+channels or the abstractions in package sync.
+
+The runtime.Alloc, runtime.Free, and runtime.Lookup functions, an unsafe API
+created for debugging the memory allocator, have no replacement.
+
+The runtime.Cgocalls and runtime.Goroutines functions have been renamed to
+runtime.NumCgoCall and runtime.NumGoroutine.
+
+The "go fix" command will update code to accommodate most of these changes.
