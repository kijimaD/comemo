    doc/go1.17: document //go:build lines
    
    In 1.17, //go:build lines are fully supported. This entails changes to
    the go command, vet, and gofmt. Document all of them.
    
    I'm not Russ, but this is a significant change, it slipped under the
    radar, and we're trying to get the release out. So here's what I got.
    
    I wasn't sure where to put the go command change. On the one hand,
    it's pretty significant. On the other, it certainly affects fewer
    people than lazy loading. So it probably shouldn't be first, but I also
    didn't want to bury it the middle of all the other module changes. Open
    to suggestions.
