    cmd/go: remove unnecessary b.Print setting
    
    The Builder returned by work.NewBuilder is already setup to print to
    os.Stderr, so it's not necessary for runRun to set b.Print to a
    different function that does exactly the same thing.
    
    This b.Print assignment was introduced in CL 5591045. At the time, the
    builder type defaulted to printing to os.Stdout, so this was necessary
    to make "go run" print build errors to stderr.
