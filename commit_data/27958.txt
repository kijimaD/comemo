    net/http: fix unwanted HTTP/2 conn Transport crash after IdleConnTimeout
    
    Go 1.7 crashed after Transport.IdleConnTimeout if an HTTP/2 connection
    was established but but its caller no longer wanted it. (Assuming the
    connection cache was enabled, which it is by default)
    
    Fixes #16208
