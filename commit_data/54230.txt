    go/scanner: give specific error for curvy “abc” quotes
    
    Code examples sometimes mistakenly use curvy quotes,
    leading to hard-to-spot invalid token errors.
    This change makes the error message explicit.
    
    (An alternative change would be to accept them in place
    of "abc" and emit an error, but the extra check would
    likely add an unacceptable dynamic cost to string scanning.)
    
    Fixes #61450
