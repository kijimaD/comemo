    doc/go1.13: remove announcements of arm64 support on NetBSD and OpenBSD
    
    Those configurations currently lack builders, and it is not clear to
    me what state their tests are in.
    
    The Go porting policy¹ requires builders for all active ports, so
    let's not claim support until that requirement is met.
