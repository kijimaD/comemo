    cmd/5g, cmd/6g, cmd/8g: provide embedded trampolines with argument size information
    
    An embedded trampoline is a function that exists to marshal
    a receiver of type *S to a receiver of type *T when T is an
    embedded field in S.
    
    Embedded trampolines are generated by a special path through
    the compiler and are not subject to the general analysis and
    annotation done to functions.  Their effects must be provided
    explicitly.
