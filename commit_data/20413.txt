    runtime: fix traceback of trap on ARM
    
    The merged traceback was wrong for LR machines,
    because traceback didn't pass lr to gentraceback.
    Now that we have a test looking at traceback output
    for a trap (the test of runtime.Breakpoint),
    we caught this.
    
    While we're here, fix a 'set and not used' warning.
    
    Fixes arm build.
