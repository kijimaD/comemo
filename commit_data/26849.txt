    syscall: Fix generator for Linux syscalls.
    
    In golang.org/cl/14449 the `getdents' system call got changed to use
    _SYS_getdents as a layer of indirection instead of SYS_GETDENTS64 for
    compatibility with mips64, but this broke mksyscall.pl, which then
    died with with:
      syscall_linux.go:840: malformed //sys declaration
