    spec: clarify behavior of map size hint for make built-in
    
    The spec already states that the precise behavior of the map size
    hint provided to the make built-in is implementation-dependent.
    
    Exclude requiring specific run-time behavior for maps.
    (The current Go compiler does not panic if the size hint is negative
    at run-time.)
    
    Fixes #53219.
