    encoding/xml: remove Marshaler support
    
    Marshaler has a number of open areas that need
    further thought (e.g. it doesn't handle attributes,
    it's supposed to handle tag names internally but has
    no information to do so, etc).
    
    We're removing it now and will bring it back with an
    interface that covers these aspects, after Go 1.
    
    Related to issue 2771, but doesn't fix it.
