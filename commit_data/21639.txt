    [dev.cc] cmd/asm: the assembler proper
    
    Add main.go, the simple driver for the assembler, and the
    subdirectory internal/asm, which contains the parser and
    instruction generator.
    
    It's likely that much of the implementation is superstition,
    or at best experimental phenomenology, but it does generate
    working binaries.
