commit de03d502c7e0bd07c6f084ed9b5bb0446df29b49
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 3 13:26:43 2011 -0700

    net: renamings
    This is Go 1 package renaming CL #3.
    This one merely moves the source; the import strings will be
    changed after the next weekly release.
    This one moves pieces into net.
    
    http -> net/http
    http/cgi -> net/http/cgi
    http/fcgi -> net/http/fcgi
    http/pprof -> net/http/pprof
    http/httptest -> net/http/httptest
    mail -> net/mail
    rpc -> net/rpc
    rpc/jsonrpc -> net/rpc/jsonrpc
    smtp -> net/smtp
    url -> net/url
    
    Also remove rand (now math/rand) from NOTEST - it has a test.
    
    The only edits are in Makefiles and deps.bash.
