    cmd/dist: enable build cache always
    
    GOCACHE=off is not a reliable signal of user intent.
    
    At startup the go command fills in an empty GOCACHE with the effective setting.
    If $HOME is set, then GOCACHE ends up somewhere in $HOME/.cache.
    But if $HOME is unset, then the go command sets GOCACHE=off explicitly.
    
    That environment is used for invoking "go tool dist".
    
    So if the machine has no $HOME, then go tool dist ends up with the cache
    disabled even though the user was not trying to disable the cache.
    This affects the linux-ppc64le builder, which appears to be unique
    among builders in not having $HOME set. So that builder is running
    with no build cache.
    
    Now that there is a cmd/go test that needs the cache to be on,
    the linux-ppc64le builder is failing.
    
    In the next release we intend to force the use of the build cache
    always. This CL is not doing that: it's only forcing the use of the
    build cache during all.bash, which won't affect the majority of
    our users (they run pre-build binary releases).
    
    If this is a problem we can roll it back and fix the linux-ppc64le
    builders some other way.
    
    While we're here, print a few more useful variables in 'go tool dist env'
    and sort the output.
