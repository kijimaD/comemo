    cmd/go/internal/modload: split updateRoots into separate functions for updating and tidying
    
    In CL 293689, I fused the mvs.Reqs calls that were formerly in MinReqs
    and TidyBuildList into a single function, updateRoots, in the hope
    that it expressed a fundamental operation. As I have been working on
    the lazy equivalents, I have come to realize that these functions are
    deeply related but fundamentally different.
    
    In order to help me reason about the two different roles, I am making
    the two functions separate once more, but leaving them colocated in
    the code.
    
    For #36460
