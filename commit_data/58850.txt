    spec: remove notion of core types
    
    This CL removes the notion of core types from the spec.
    
    Instead of referring to core types, each section that did
    so before is reverted to approx. the pre-generics (1.17)
    prose, and additional paragraphs cover the type parameter
    cases as needed.
    
    The hope is that this makes it easier to read the spec.
    When type parameters are involved, the extra prose is
    local to the language feature in question and thus more
    readily available. When no type parameters are present,
    readers do not have to concern themselves with core types.
    
    In contrast to CL 621919, this change is not intended to
    loosen the spec in any way and therefore does not change
    the language (if the new prose implies otherwise, we will
    correct it).
    
    Except for adjustments to compiler error messages
    (no mention of core types anymore), no other changes
    to the compiler or tools are required.
    
    Future CLs may selectively relax requirements on a language
    construct by language construct basis; each such change can
    be discussed and proposed independently.
    
    For #70128.
