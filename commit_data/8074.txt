    http: flesh out server Expect handling + tests
    
    This mostly adds Expect 100-continue tests (from
    the perspective of server correctness) that were
    missing before.
    
    It also fixes a few missing cases that will
    probably never come up in practice, but it's nice
    to have handled correctly.
    
    Proper 100-continue client support remains a TODO.
