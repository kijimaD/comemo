    go/internal/gccgoimporter: backport from x/tools to ensure identical code
    
    This change backports a minor modification of the x/tools version of this
    code back into the std library. It simply ensures that both versions of
    the code are the same and will simplify keeping them in sync down the
    road.
    
    While this is an API change, this is an internal package, so we're ok.
    
    Updates #27891.
