    [dev.power64] liblink: generate dnames[5689] for D_* constants
    
    This is more complicated than the other enums because the D_*
    enums are full of explicit initializers and repeated values.
    This tries its best.  (This will get much cleaner once we
    tease these constants apart better.)
