    go/doc: propagate types from unexported constants
    
    When constants were declared using unexported constants,
    the type information was lost when those constants were filtered out.
    This CL propagates the type information of unexported constants
    so that it is available for display.
    
    This is a follow-up to CL 144110044, which fixed this problem
    specifically for _ constants.
    
    Updates #5397.
