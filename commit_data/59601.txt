    cmd/compile/internal/liveness: introduce "live intervals" utility
    
    Introduce a helper type "Intervals" that contains sets of sorted
    disjoint ranges corresponding to live ranges within a function.
    Example: the Intervals set "{ [0,1), [4,10) }" would indicate that
    something is live starting at instruction 0, then up to but not
    including instruction 1, then dead from 1-3, then live again at
    instruction 4 up to (but not including) instruction 10.
    
    This patch provides APIs for constructing interval sets, testing to
    see whether two sets overlap, and unioning/merging together two
    intervals sets.
    
    Updates #62737.
    Updates #65532.
    Updates #65495.
