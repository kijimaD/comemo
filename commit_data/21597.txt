    runtime: rename drainworkbuf and drainobjects
    
    drainworkbuf is now gcDrain, since it drains until there's
    nothing left to drain.  drainobjects is now gcDrainN because it's
    the bounded equivalent to gcDrain.
    
    The new names use the Go camel case convention because we have to
    start somewhere.  The "gc" prefix is because we don't have runtime
    packages yet and just "drain" is too ambiguous.
