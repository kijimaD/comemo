    fs: clarify documentation for ReadDir method
    
    The fs.ReadDir method behaves the same way as
    os.ReadDir, in that when n <= 0, ReadDir returns
    all DirEntry values remaining in the dictionary.
    
    Update the comment to reflect that only remaining
    DirEntry values are returned (not all entries),
    for subsequent calls.
    
    Fixes #69301
