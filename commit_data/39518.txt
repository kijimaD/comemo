    cmd/go: clarify error text for module path mismatch
    
    This error occurs when a module is loaded with one name (for example,
    github.com/golang/lint) but declares a different path in its go.mod
    (golang.org/x/lint). The current text "unexpected module path" is
    confusing. It doesn't explain why the path was unexpected, and it's
    not clear what was expected.
    
    With this change, the error text includes the module and version
    containing the go.mod file with the error, the declared module path,
    and the loaded module path. The paths are vertically aligned so
    differences are visually obvious. As with other module version errors,
    the shortest chain of requirements is printed.
    
    This change supercedes CL 158477.
    
    Fixes #28489
