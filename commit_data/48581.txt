    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: remove code dealing with multiple method names
    
    When parsing method declarations in an interface, the parser has
    for historic reasons gracefully handled a list of method names with
    a single (common) signature, and then reported an error. For example
    
            interface {
                    m1, m2, m3 (x int)
            }
    
    This code originally came from the very first parser for Go which
    initially permitted such declarations (or at least assumed that
    people would write such declarations). Nobody is doing this at this
    point, so there's no need for being extra careful here. Remove the
    respective code and adjust the corresponding test.
