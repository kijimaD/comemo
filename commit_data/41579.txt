    cmd/go/internal/work: fix error while passing custom vet tool
    
    For GOROOT packages, we were adding -unsafeptr=false to prevent unsafe.Pointer
    checks. But the flag also got passed to invocations of go vet with a custom
    vet tool. To prevent this from happening, we add this flag only when no
    tools are passed.
    
    Fixes #34053
