    syscall: fix creds_test to reliably close os.File
    
    Before this patch the test would close the file descriptor but
    not the os.File.  When the os.File was GC'ed, the finalizer
    would close the file descriptor again.  That would cause
    problems if the same file descriptor were returned by a later
    call to open in another test.
    
    On my system:
    
    > GOGC=30 go test
    --- FAIL: TestPassFD (0.04 seconds)
    passfd_test.go:62:      FileConn: dup: bad file descriptor
    FAIL
