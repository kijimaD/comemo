    [dev.fuzz] testing: cleanup a few small things
    
    Deletes the exported testing.Fuzz function
    which would run a standalone fuzz target.
    Similar to RunFuzzing and RunFuzzTargets,
    which were previously removed, this will
    likely be too complex to support.
    
    Moves the deferred Exit in f.Fuzz higher up
    the function so it is always run.
