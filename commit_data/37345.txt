    cmd/link: abstract DWARF metadata symbol lookup
    
    The compiler passes a lot of DWARF metadata about functions to the
    linker via symbols whose names are derived from the function's own
    symbol name. We look up these symbols in several places. This is about
    to get slightly more complex as we introduce ABIs as symbol versions,
    so abstract this lookup pattern into a helper function.
    
    For #27539.
