    cmd/compile: attach slots to incoming params for better debugging
    
    This change attaches a slots to the OpArg values for
    incoming params, and this in turn causes location lists
    to be generated for params, and that yields better
    debugging, in delve and sometimes in gdb.
    
    The parameter lifetimes could start earlier; they are in
    fact defined on entry, not at the point where the OpArg is
    finally mentioned.  (that will be addressed in another CL)
