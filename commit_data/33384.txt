    archive/tar: re-implement USTAR path splitting
    
    The logic for USTAR was disabled because a previous implementation of
    Writer had a wrong understanding of the differences between USTAR and GNU,
    causing the prefix field is incorrectly be populated in GNU files.
    
    Now that this issue has been fixed, we can re-enable the logic for USTAR
    path splitting, which allows Writer to use the USTAR for a wider range
    of possible inputs.
