    runtime: remove atomic store requirement on pageAlloc.chunks
    
    pageAlloc.chunks used to require an atomic store when growing the heap
    because the scavenger would look at the list without locking the heap
    lock. However, the scavenger doesn't do that anymore, and it looks like
    nothing really does at all.
    
    This change updates the comment and makes the store non-atomic.
