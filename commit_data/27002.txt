    crypto/aes: delete TestEncryptBlock and TestDecryptBlock
    
    The encryptBlock and decryptBlock functions are already tested
    (via the public API) by TestCipherEncrypt and TestCipherDecrypt
    respectively. Both sets of tests check the output of the two
    functions against the same set of FIPS 197 examples. I therefore
    think it is safe to delete these two tests without losing any
    coverage.
    
    Deleting these two tests will make it easier to modify the
    internal API, which I am hoping to do in future CLs.
