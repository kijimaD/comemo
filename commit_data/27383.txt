    misc/ios: deflake tests on darwin/arm{,arm64}
    
    A retry mechanism is in place to combat the inherent flakiness of
    launching iOS test binaries. Before it covered just the starting of
    lldb; expand it to cover the setup steps as well. Note that the
    running of the binary itself is (still) not retried, to avoid
    covering over genuine bugs.
    
    On my test device (iPhone 5S, iOS 9.3) starting lldb can take longer
    than 10 seconds, so increase the timeout for that.
    Furthermore, some basic steps such as setting breakpoints in lldb
    can take longer than the 1 second timeout. Increase that timeout
    as well, to 2 seconds.
    
    Finally, improve the error message for when ios-deploy is not
    installed.
    
    For #14318
