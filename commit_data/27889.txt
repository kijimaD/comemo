    cmd/link, cmd/compile: typelink sorting in linker
    
    Instead of writing out the type almost twice in the symbol name,
    teach the linker how to sort typelink symbols by their contents.
    
    This ~halves the size of typelink symbol names, which helps very
    large (6KB) names like those mentioned in #15104.
    
    This does not increase the total sorting work done by the linker,
    and makes it possible to use shorter symbol names for types. See
    the follow-on CL 21583.
