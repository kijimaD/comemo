    cmd/go: test that 'go mod tidy' uses transitive requirements from replacements
    
    The existing mod_tidy test uses replacements, but doesn't replace
    modules that can also be resolved by fetching from GOPROXY, and
    doesn't check the differences between the internal and external views.
    
    This new test clarifies that interaction with a more realistic example.
