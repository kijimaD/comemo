    runtime: skip wb call in growslice when unnecessary
    
    Instrumenting make.bash reveals that almost half (49.54%)
    of the >16 million calls to growslice for
    pointer-containing slices are
    growing from an empty to a non-empty slice.
    
    In that case, there is no need to call the write barrier,
    which does some work before discovering that no pointers need shading.
