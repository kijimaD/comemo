commit 8d0265dd32c729822db377a5a2cc5d2abbe40648
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>

    test: Match gccgo error messages.
    
    The gccgo compiler does not always generate a "cannot use"
    error message.  It only does so for named types.  Maybe that
    should change, but in any case it is irrelevant for this test.
