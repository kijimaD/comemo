commit 3188ffc93138ca18857575052f74100d64e31df5

    go spec: conversion types starting with "func" must be parenthesized
    
    Also: Be explicit what operator means with respect to conversion types.
    
    The parenthesis requirement is a language change. At the moment,
    literal function types in conversions that cannot possibly be
    followed by a '(' don't need parentheses. For instance:
    
            func(int)int(x)  ->  same as (func(int)int)(x)
            func()()(x)      ->  same as (func())(x)
    
    but:
    
            func(int)(x)     ->  could be func(int)x {...}
    
    Fixes #4109.
