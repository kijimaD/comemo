    api: remove unnecessary lines from except.txt
    
    When I added the text/template/parse lines, I thought that both removed
    and added APIs should be listed here (i.e. both -pkg and +pkg lines).
    However that was wrong, as one can see by reading cmd/api/goapi.go, or
    seeing how removing the +pkg lines does not break the API test.
