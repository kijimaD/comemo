    cmd/gc: add zeroing to enable precise stack accounting
    
    There is more zeroing than I would like right now -
    temporaries used for the new map and channel runtime
    calls need to be eliminated - but it will do for now.
    
    This CL only has an effect if you are building with
    
            GOEXPERIMENT=precisestack ./all.bash
    
    (or make.bash). It costs about 5% in the overall time
    spent in all.bash. That number will come down before
    we make it on by default, but this should be enough for
    Keith to try using the precise maps for copying stacks.
    
    amd64 only (and it's not really great generated code).
