    cmd/compile: use more range fors in gc
    
    Slightly simplifies the code. Made sure to exclude the cases that would
    change behavior, such as when the iterated value is a string, when the
    index is modified within the body, or when the slice is modified.
    
    Also checked that all the elements are of pointer type, to avoid the
    corner case where non-pointer types could be copied by mistake.
