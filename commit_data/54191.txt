    syscall: skip TestUnshareMountNameSpaceChroot on platforms that require external linking
    
    TestUnshareMountNameSpaceChroot attempts to build a statically-linked
    binary to run in a chroot, and sets CGO_ENABLED=0 in order to do so.
    Rather than trying to figure out some other way to coax the linker
    into building a static binary, let's just skip the test on Linux
    platforms that require external linking (namely android/arm).
    
    This should fix the build failure reported in
    https://build.golang.org/log/1ea245a9c2e916c81043db177be76778bab00058.
    
    While we're here, let's also fix the failure logging to make the text
    readable!
    
    Updates #46330.
