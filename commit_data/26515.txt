    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: tweak init function prologue
    
    We used to compare the init state with == to 0 and 2, which
    requires 2 comparisons.  Instead, compare with 1 and use
    <, ==.  That requires only one comparison.
    
    This isn't a big deal performance-wise, as it is just init
    code.  But there is a fair amount of init code, so this
    should help a bit with code size.
