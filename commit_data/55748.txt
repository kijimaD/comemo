    runtime: create an API for unwinding inlined frames
    
    We've replicated the code to expand inlined frames in many places in
    the runtime at this point. This CL adds a simple iterator API that
    abstracts this out.
    
    We also use this to try out a new idea for structuring tests of
    runtime internals: rather than exporting this whole internal data type
    and API, we write the test in package runtime and import the few bits
    of std we need. The idea is that, for tests of internals, it's easier
    to inject public APIs from std than it is to export non-public APIs
    from runtime. This is discussed more in #55108.
    
    For #54466.
