    os: try openFile before openDir in windows os.OpenFile
    
    Logging calls when running "go install -a std" turns:
    
      547  openDir succeeded
      3593 openDir failed and fell back to openFile
      3592 openFile succeeded
      1    both failed
    
    into:
    
      3592 openFile succeeded
      548  openFile failed and fell back
      547  openDir succeeded
      1    both failed
    
    Here the change trades 3593 failed openDir for 548 failed openFile.
    
    Fix issue 7426.
