    cmd/link: do not mark holes in functab
    
    With multiple text sections, there may be holes (non-Go code) in
    the PC range of Go code and covered by the functab. Previously, we
    use a linear search with actual PCs to find the functab entry. We
    need to use special entries to mark holes, so a PC in the hole can
    be distinguished from the previous function.
    
    Now, with the previous CL we find if the PC is in between of the
    sections upfront in textOff. There is no need to mark holes in the
    functab.
