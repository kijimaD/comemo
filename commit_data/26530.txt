    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: cache sparse sets in Config
    
    Move the cached sparse sets to the Config.  I tested make.bash with
    pre-allocating sets of size 150 and not caching very small sets, but the
    difference between this implementation (no min size, no preallocation)
    and a min size with preallocation was fairly negligible:
    
    Number of sparse sets allocated:
    Cached in Config w/none preallocated no min size    3684 *this CL*
    Cached in Config w/three preallocated no min size   3370
    Cached in Config w/three preallocated min size=150  3370
    Cached in Config w/none preallocated min size=150  15947
    Cached in Func,  w/no min                          96996 *previous code*
