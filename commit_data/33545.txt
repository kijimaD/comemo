    [release-branch.go1.9] cmd/compile: remove gc.Sysfunc calls from 387 backend
    
    [This is a cherry-pick of CL 54090 to the 1.9 release branch.]
    
    gc.Sysfunc must not be called concurrently.
    We set up runtime routines used by the backend
    prior to doing any backend compilation.
    I missed the 387 ones; fix that.
    
    Sysfunc should have been unexported during 1.9.
    I will rectify that in a subsequent CL.
    
    Fixes #21352
