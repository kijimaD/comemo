    cmd/go/internal/mvs: prune spurious dependencies in Downgrade
    
    Previously, mvs.Downgrade could introduce spurious dependencies if the
    downgrade computed for one module lands on a “hidden” version (such as
    a pseudo-version) due to a requirement introduced by the downgrade for
    another module.
    
    To eliminate those spurious dependencies, we can add one more call to
    BuildList to recompute the “actual” downgraded versions, and then
    including only those actual versions in the final call to BuildList.
    
    For #36460
