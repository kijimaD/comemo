    [dev.link] cmd/link: migrate symbol's Value and Align when converting to sym.Symbols
    
    Currently, in LoadFull we migrate a symbol's Value to sym.Symbol
    only for external symbols. And symbol's Align is not migrated at
    all. As we move LoadFull forward, there are already places where
    we set symbol's Value and Align (e.g. in doelf). Migrate them
    correctly.
    
    Currently I think we only set them on external symbols, but as
    we move forward I think we'll need to set them on Go symbols as
    well.
