    go/doc: support examples on methods from embedded unexported types
    
    In
    
      type T1 struct { t2 }
      type t2 int
      func (t2) M()
    
    T1 has method M because it embeds t2, which has M. Classify
    the example
    
      func ExampleT1_M
    
    with T1 instead of ignoring it, as is done currently. There is no
    other way to provide an example for such a method, since its original
    type is unexported.
    
    Continue to ignore examples on methods from embedded types that are
    exported, unless in AllMethods mode. Examples for those methods could
    be written on the original type.
    
    The change involves removing a check in classifyExamples. The check
    isn't necessary to get the above behavior because
    reader.collectEmbeddedMethods and sortedFuncs already generate the
    appropriate list of methods.
    
    For #40172.
