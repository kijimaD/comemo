    test: update list of escape reasons
    
    The escape_because.go test file (which tests the "because" escape
    explainations printed by `-m -m`) cointains a machine-generated list
    of all the escape reasons seen in the escape tests.
    
    The list appears to be outdated; moreove a new escape reason was added
    in CL 102895. This change re-generates the list.
