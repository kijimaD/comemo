    cmd/asm: VPERMQ's imm8 arg is an uint8
    
    The imm8 argument consists of 4 2-bit indices, so it can take values up
    to $255. However, the assembler was treating it as Yi8, which reads
    "fits in int8". Add a Yu8 variant, to also keep backwards compatibility
    with negative values possible with Yi8.
    
    Fixes #24378.
