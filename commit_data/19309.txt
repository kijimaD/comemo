    cmd/go: accept build flags in clean and list
    
    list has been adding them one at a time haphazardly
    (race and tags were there and documented; compiler
    was there and undocumented).
    
    clean -i needs -compiler in order to clean the
    installed targets for alternate compilers.
    
    Fixes #7302.
    
    While we're here, tweak the language in the 'go get' docs
    about build flags.
    
    Fixes #7807.
