    [dev.link] cmd/internal/obj: use index for static symbols
    
    In assembly we always reference symbols by name. But for static
    symbols, as they are reachable only within the current file, we
    can assign them local indices and use the indices to reference
    them. The index is only meaningful locally, and it is fine.
