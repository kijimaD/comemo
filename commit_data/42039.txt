    cmd/trace: fix the broken link in region pages and improve UX
    
    The trace tool had a broken link due to a parameter encoding error,
    which has been corrected.
    
    In addition:
    
    - the user regions page has been enhanced to include links to
    pprof style profiles for region specific io, block, syscall and
    schedwait profiles.
    
    - sortable table headers have a pointer cursor to indicate they're
    clickable.
    
    Fixes #38518
