    math, cmd/compile: rename Fma to FMA
    
    This API was added for #25819, where it was discussed as math.FMA.
    The commit adding it used math.Fma, presumably for consistency
    with the rest of the unusual names in package math
    (Sincos, Acosh, Erfcinv, Float32bits, etc).
    
    I believe that using an idiomatic Go name is more important here
    than consistency with these other names, most of which are historical
    baggage from C's standard library.
    
    Early additions like Float32frombits happened before "uppercase for export"
    (so they were originally like "float32frombits") and they were not properly
    reconsidered when we uppercased the symbols to export them.
    That's a mistake we live with.
    
    The names of functions we have added since then, and even a few
    that were legacy, are more properly Go-cased, such as IsNaN, IsInf,
    and RoundToEven, rather than Isnan, Isinf, and Roundtoeven.
    And also constants like MaxFloat32.
    
    For new API, we should keep using proper Go-cased symbols
    instead of minimally-upper-cased-C symbols.
    
    So math.FMA, not math.Fma.
    
    This API has not yet been released, so this change does not break
    the compatibility promise.
    
    This CL also modifies cmd/compile, since the compiler knows
    the name of the function. I could have stopped at changing the
    string constants, but it seemed to make more sense to use a
    consistent casing everywhere.
