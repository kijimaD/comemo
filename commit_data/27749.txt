    crypto/tls: Enforce that version and cipher match on resume.
    
    Per RFC 5246, 7.4.1.3:
    
       cipher_suite
          The single cipher suite selected by the server from the list in
          ClientHello.cipher_suites.  For resumed sessions, this field is
          the value from the state of the session being resumed.
    
    The specifications are not very clearly written about resuming sessions
    at the wrong version (i.e. is the TLS 1.0 notion of "session" the same
    type as the TLS 1.1 notion of "session"?). But every other
    implementation enforces this check and not doing so has some odd
    semantics.
