    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: add NewBasic and cleanup universe
    
    This CL introduces types.NewBasic, for creating the predeclared
    universal types, and reorganizes how the universe is initialized so
    that all predeclared types are uniformly constructed.
    
    There are now a bunch of Type fields that are no longer assigned
    outside of the package, so this CL also introduces some new accessor
    methods that a subsequent CL will mechanically introduce uses of.
