    doc/go1.17: clarify Modules changes
    
    Writing CL 333629 clarified my thinking about the behavioral changes
    associated with lazy loading. There are really two interrelated
    changes — graph pruning, and lazy loading proper — that are both made
    possible by the added redundancy in the go.mod file.
    
    (I had initially approached the whole cluster of features as “lazy
    loading” because that was the starting point for the design. Graph
    pruning came into the picture when we looked at how to bound the
    worst-case behavior of lazy loading, but it is really the more
    important of the two aspects of the design.)
    
    Note that this change adds links to doc anchors added in CL 333629.
    
    Fixes #36460
    Fixes #47397
