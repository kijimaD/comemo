    time: add Now()/UnixNano() malloc tests
    
    The fix for issue 4403 may include more calls to time.Now().UnixNano(). I was concerned that if this function allocated it would cause additional garbage on the heap. It turns out that it doesn't, which is a nice surprise.
    
    Also add benchmark for Now().UnixNano()
