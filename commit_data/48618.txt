    cmd/link: use correct alignment in PE DWARF sections
    
    Set the correct section flags to insure that .debug_* sections are
    using 1-byte alignment instead of the default. This seems to be
    important for later versions of LLVM-mingw on windows (shows up on the
    windows/arm64 builder).
    
    Updates #46406.
