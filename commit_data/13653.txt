commit 98883c811a217aa562f92e9bc03be3cd4fac5b5f

    exp/locale/collate: let regtest generate its own collation table.
    The main table will need to get a slightly different collation table as the one
    used by regtest, as the regtest is based on the standard UCA DUCET, while
    the locale-specific tables are all based on a CLDR root table.
    This change allows changing the table without affecting the regression test.
