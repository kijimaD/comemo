    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: flag recomputing: find original values correctly
    
    We "spill" flag values by recomputing them from their original
    inputs.  The "find original inputs" part of the algorithm was
    a hack.  It was broken by rematerialization.  This change does
    the real job of keeping track of original values for each
    spill/restore/flagrecompute/rematerialization we issue.
