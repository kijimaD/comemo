    runtime/coverage: fix problematic test from issue 59563
    
    Fix up the coverage testpoint TestIssue59563TruncatedCoverPkgAll
    to avoid spurious failures due to racy behavior. Specifically,
    we are only interested in verifying coverage for the larger
    function of the two in the test package (the smaller one is only
    there to trigger additional function registrations while the
    test is finalizing the cov data).
    
    Updates #59867.
    Updates #59563.
