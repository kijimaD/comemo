    cmd/internal/gc: registerize more in 7g and 9g
    
    7g and 9g disagree with componentgen
    about what type len and cap have.
    
    This results in an etype mismatch,
    which inhibits registerization.
    
    Fixing this results in 7406 more registerizations
    while building the stdlib.
    There are still 1512 missed opportunities.
    
    This should improve the performance benefit
    to 7g of enabling componentgen (CL 8636).
    
    This CL reduces the size of godoc by 203k (-1.177%).
    
    This was discovered by using the diagnostics
    added in CL 8732 and running:
    
    GOARCH=arm64 GOOS=linux go build -gcflags="-d registerization" std
    
    See CL 91850043 for similar earlier fixes for 6g and 8g.
