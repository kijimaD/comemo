    net: fix looking up port numbers starting with numbers.
    
    LookupPort() correctly parses service names beginning with numerals by
    implementing a new parser, mainly taken from strconv/atoi.go.
    
    Also testes some previously undefined behaviours around port numbers
    larger than 65535 that previously could lead to some tests fail with
    EOPNOTSUPP (Operation Not Supported).
    
    Fixes #14322
