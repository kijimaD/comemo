    obj/x86: make VEX-specified-register explicit
    
    "VEX.vvvv" field (VSR, VEX-specified-register) made explicit
    in Optab encoding.
    
    vexNDS, vexNDD, vexDDS and vexNOVSR do nothing,
    this change does not produce any noticeable effect.
    
    Rationale behind this change:
    - keep more information inside optab entries
    - make encodings match SDM more closely
    - one less special rule to keep in mind
    
    Pvex optabs are updated based on the Intel SDM descriptions.
    
    Unused VEX combinations are removed;
    it is problematic to choose VSR combinations for them
    without actual Optabs that use them.
    
    The origin of this idea can be found in:
