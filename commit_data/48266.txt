    cmd/dist,cmd/go: set GOTRACEBACK to "system" for testing
    
    If we're testing through dist, we're testing the implementation of Go,
    so we're interested in any package failing with potential runtime
    issues. In these cases, we'd like to have as much relevant detail as
    possible, but currently runtime stack frames and goroutines are
    suppressed due to the default GOTRACEBACK setting.
    
    So, try to set GOTRACEBACK to system if it's unset. Check if it's unset
    first so we don't override the user asking for a lower or higher level.
    
    This change was brought up in the context of #45916, since there's an
    apparent deadlock (or something!) in the runtime that appears when
    running other code, but it's difficult to see exactly where it's
    blocked. However, this change is very generally useful.
    
    This change also runs scripted tests with GOTRACEBACK=system, upgrading
    from GOTRACEBACK=all. Often, script tests can trigger failures deep in
    the runtime in interesting ways because they start many individual Go
    processes, so being able to identify points of interest in the runtime
    is quite useful.
    
    For #45916.
