    runtime: explain and enforce that _panic values live on the stack
    
    It's a bit mysterious that _defer.sp is a uintptr that gets
    stack-adjusted explicitly while _panic.argp is an unsafe.Pointer that
    doesn't, but turns out to be critically important when a deferred
    function grows the stack before doing a recover.
    
    Add a comment explaining that this works because _panic values live on
    the stack. Enforce this by marking _panic go:notinheap.
