commit dae2992c98bff181b023f27889c513d89714f5ac

    misc/dashboard/codereview: send mail immediately, and fill in time.Time fields.
    
    If we delay the mail sending, we can't send as the current user.
    If we don't fill in the time.Time fields, datastore.Put will fail
    because the zero time.Time value is out of its range.
