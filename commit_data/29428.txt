    time: document in UnixNano when the value is valid
    
    It is unlikely that the value of UnixNano overflow in most
    use cases. However, the max date of 2262 is also within the range
    where it may be of concern to some users. Rather than have each
    person recompute when this overflows to validate if its okay for
    their use case, we just document it as within the years 1678 and
    2262, for user's convenience.
    
    Fixes #16977
