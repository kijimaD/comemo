    runtime: don't inspect the stack for delayed signals from TSAN
    
    Cgo TSAN (not the Go race detector) intercepts signals and calls
    the signal handler at a later time. When the signal handler is
    called, the memory may have changed, but the signal context
    remains old. As the signal context and the memory don't match, it
    is unsafe to unwind the stack from the signal PC and SP. We have
    to ignore the signal.
    
    It is probably also not safe to do async preemption, which relies
    on the signal PC, and inspects and even writes to the stack (for
    call injection).
    
    We also inspect the stack for fatal signals (e.g. SIGSEGV), but I
    think they are not delayed. For other signals we don't inspect
    the stack, so they are probably fine.
    
    Fixes #27540.
