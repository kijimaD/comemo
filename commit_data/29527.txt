    syscall: Clearenv now unsets env vars on Windows
    
    Previously, `os.Clearenv()` (by way of `syscall.Clearenv`) would simply
    set all environment variables' values to `""` rather than actually
    unsetting them causing subsequent `os.LookupEnv` calls to return that
    they were still set.
    
    Fixes #17902
