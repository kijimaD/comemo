    runtime: consistency check for G rescan position
    
    Issue #17099 shows a failure that indicates we rescanned a stack twice
    concurrently during mark termination, which suggests that the rescan
    list became inconsistent. Add a simple check when we dequeue something
    from the rescan list that it claims to be at the index where we found
    it.
