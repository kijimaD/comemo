    cmd/dist: support for NetBSD/ARM
    1. when executing a unsupported VFP instruction, the NetBSD kernel somehow
    doesn't report SIGILL, and instead just spin and spin, we add a alarm(2)
    to detect this case (albeit this is a kernel bug).
    2. NetBSD/ARM's VFP11 support is not complete, so temporarily disable it.
    3. The default gcc shipped with NetBSD-current mis-optimizes our code
    at -O2, so lower the optimization level to -O1 on NetBSD/ARM.
