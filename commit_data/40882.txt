    cmd/go: fix and re-enable build_trimpath test
    
    The test was comparing a binary built from a list of files to a test
    build from a named package. That should not (and did not) work. The
    test now compares two binaries built the same way in different
    directories.
    
    Also add a portion of the test for GOPATH and fix the gccgo portion of
    the test (verified manually).
    
    Fixes #35435
