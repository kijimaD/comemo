    archive/tar: remove dead code with USTAR path splitting
    
    Convert splitUSTARPath to return a bool rather than an error since
    the caller never ever uses the error other than to check if it is
    nil. Thus, we can remove errNameTooLong as well.
    
    Also, fold the checking of the length <= fileNameSize and whether
    the string is ASCII into the split function itself.
    
    Lastly, remove logic to set the MAGIC since that's already done on
    L200. Thus, setting the magic is redundant.
    
    There is no overall logic change.
