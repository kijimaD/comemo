    crypto/x509: skip SystemRootsError test on Windows
    
    On Windows, crypto/x509 passes through to Windows's CryptoAPI
    to verify certificate chains. This method can't produce a
    SystemRootsError, so make sure we always skip the test on
    Windows.
    
    This is needed because testVerify is called in both
    TestGoVerify and TestSystemVerify on Windows - one is for
    testing the Go verifier, the other one is for testing the
    CryptoAPI verifier. The orignal CL tried to sidestep
    this issue by setting systemSkip to true, but that only
    affected TestSystemVerify.
