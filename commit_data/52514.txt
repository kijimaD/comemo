    cmd/go: mod tidy returns proper error with /tmp/go.mod
    
    `go mod tidy` results in panic due to nil pointer dereference with the
    current implementation. Though the panic occurs only in a limited situation
    described as below, we had better fix it.
    
    Situation:
    - go.mod is in the exactly system's temporary directory (i.e. temp root)
    - `go mod tidy` in temp root or in the child directory not having go.mod
    
    No go.mod are found in the situation (i.e. *modFile is nil), however,
    *modFile is referred without nil check.
    
    Although just adding nil check works well, the better solution is using
    ModFile() function. It works as same as the current implementation and,
    in addition, it has either nil check and user friendly error indication.
    With using it, users can get a proper error message like "go.mod file not
    found in current directory or any parent directory" instead of a panic.
    
    Fixes #51992
