    cmd/go: error on space-separated list with comma
    
    Using 'go build -tags "foo,bar"' might seem to work when you wanted
    -tags "foo bar", since they make up a single tag that doesn't exist and
    the build is unaffected.
    
    Instead, error on any tag that contains a comma.
    
    Fixes #18800.
