    net/http: fix application/ogg sniff signature
    
    I accidentally set the wrong pattern mask as
    * []byte("\x4F\x67\x67\x53\x00") --> "OggS", the byte pattern itself.
    instead of
    * []byte("\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF")
    which was a copy-paste error.
    
    The correct pattern is described at
    https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#matching-an-audio-or-video-type-pattern
    which I was using as a reference but I mistyped.
    
    Fixes #20513
