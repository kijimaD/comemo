    runtime/pprof: test that stack barriers never appear in profile
    
    This adds a test that runs CPU profiling with a high load of stack
    barriers and stack barrier insertion/removal operations and checks
    that both 1) the runtime doesn't crash and 2) stackBarrier itself
    never appears in a profile. Prior to the fix for gentraceback starting
    in the middle of stackBarrier, condition 2 often failed.
