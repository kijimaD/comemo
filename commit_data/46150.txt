    cmd/go, cmd/asm: pass -linkshared to assembler for shared linkage builds
    
    When the -linkshared build mode is in effect, the Go command passes
    the "-linkshared" command line option to the compiler so as to insure
    special handling for things like builtin functions (which may appear
    in a shared library and not the main executable). This patch extends
    this behavior to the assembler, since the assembler may also wind up
    referencing builtins when emitting a stack-split prolog.
    
    Fixes #43107.
