    go/types: better names for internal helper functions (cleanup)
    
    Internal helper functions for type-checking type expressions were
    renamed to make it clearer when they should be used:
    
            typExpr (w/o def) -> typ
            typExpr (w/  def) -> definedType
            typ               -> indirectType
            typExprInternal   -> typInternal
    
    The rename emphasizes that in most cases Checker.typ should be used
    to compute the types.Type from an ast.Type. If the type is defined,
    definedType should be used. For composite type elements which are
    not "inlined" in memory, indirectType should be used.
    
    In the process, implicitly changed several uses of indirectType
    (old: typ) to typ (old: typExpr) by not changing the respective
    function call source. These implicit changes are ok in those
    places because either call is fine where we are not concerned
    about composite type elements. But using typ (old: typExpr) is
    more efficient than using indirectType (old: typ).
