    api: add FreeBSD to go1 API
    
    Now that gri has made go/parser 15% faster, I offer this
    change to slow back down cmd/api ~proportionately, adding
    FreeBSD to the go1-checked set of platforms.
    
    Really we should have done this earlier. This will prevent us
    from breaking FreeBSD compatibility accidentally in the
    future.
