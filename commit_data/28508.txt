    compress/flate: use seperate const block for exported constants
    
    As rendered on https://tip.golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/, there is an
    extra new-line because of the unexported constants in the same block.
    
    <<<
    const (
        NoCompression      = 0
        BestSpeed          = 1
        BestCompression    = 9
        DefaultCompression = -1
        HuffmanOnly        = -2 // Disables match search and only does Huffman entropy reduction.
    
    )
    >>>
    
    Instead, seperate the exported compression level constants into its own
    const block. This is both more readable and also fixes the issue.
