    runtime: check for nil g in msancall() on arm64
    
    The current msanwrite() segfaults during libpreinit
    when built with -msan on arm64. The cause is msancall()
    in runtime/msan_arm64.s called by msanwrite() assumes
    that it is always called with a valid g, leading to a
    segfult.
    
    This CL adds a check for nil g in msancall().
    
    Fixes #34338
