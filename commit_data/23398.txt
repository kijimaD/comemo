    runtime: fix signal handling on Plan 9
    
    Once added to the signal queue, the pointer passed to the
    signal handler could no longer be valid. Instead of passing
    the pointer to the note string, we recopy the value of the
    note string to a static array in the signal queue.
    
    Fixes #10784.
