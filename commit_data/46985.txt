    build: set GOPATH consistently in run.bash, run.bat, run.rc
    
    We used to clear GOPATH in all the build scripts.
    Clearing GOPATH is misleading at best, since you just end up
    with the default GOPATH (%USERPROFILE%\go on Windows).
    Unless that's your GOROOT, in which case you end up with a
    fatal error from the go command (#43938).
    
    run.bash changed to setting GOPATH=/dev/null, which has no
    clear analogue on Windows.
    
    run.rc still clears GOPATH.
    
    Change them all to set GOPATH to a non-existent directory
    /nonexist-gopath or c:\nonexist-gopath.
