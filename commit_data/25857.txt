    crypto/x509: permit serial numbers to be negative.
    
    Some software that produces certificates doesn't encode integers
    correctly and, about half the time, ends up producing certificates with
    serial numbers that are actually negative.
    
    This buggy software, sadly, appears to be common enough that we should
    let these errors pass. This change allows a Certificate.SerialNumber to
    be negative.
    
    Fixes #8265.
