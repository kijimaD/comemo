    cmd/compile: add runtime GC funcs to inlining test
    
    This is based on a list that Austin Clements provided in mid-2016. It is
    mostly untouched, except for the fact that the wbufptr funcs were
    removed from the runtime thus removed from the lits here too.
    
    Add a section for these GC funcs, since there are quite a lot of them
    and the runtime has tons of funcs that we want to inline. As before,
    sort this section too.
    
    Also place some of these funcs out of the GC section, as they are not
    directly related to the GC.
    
    Updates #21851.
