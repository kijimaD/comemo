    fmt: document existing behavior of nil receivers
    
    If a method called by fmt triggers a panic, the output usually says
    so. However, there is heretofore undocumented special treatment for
    a panic caused by formatting a nil value with an Error or String
    method: the output is simply "<nil>". Document that behavior.
