commit 0dfb22ed70749a2cd6d95ec6eee63bb213a940d4

    all: use ^TestName$ regular pattern for invoking a single test
    
    Use ^ and $ in the -run flag regular expression value when the intention
    is to invoke a single named test. This removes the reliance on there not
    being another similarly named test to achieve the intended result.
    
    In particular, package syscall has tests named TestUnshareMountNameSpace
    and TestUnshareMountNameSpaceChroot that both trigger themselves setting
    GO_WANT_HELPER_PROCESS=1 to run alternate code in a helper process. As a
    consequence of overlap in their test names, the former was inadvertently
    triggering one too many helpers.
    
    Spotted while reviewing CL 525196. Apply the same change in other places
    to make it easier for code readers to see that said tests aren't running
    extraneous tests. The unlikely cases of -run=TestSomething intentionally
    being used to run all tests that have the TestSomething substring in the
    name can be better written as -run=^.*TestSomething.*$ or with a comment
    so it is clear it wasn't an oversight.
