    time: correctly parse large input durations and avoid precision loss
    
    Do not lose precision for durations specified without fractions
    that can be represented by an int64 such as 1<<53+1 nanoseconds.
    Previously there was some precision lost in floating point conversion.
    
    Handle overflow for durations above 1<<63-1 nanoseconds but not earlier.
    
    Add tests to cover the above cases.
