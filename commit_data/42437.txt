    runtime: repair slice, string, and channel printing in gdb
    
    "Something" changed the names of types in gdb, causing the
    pretty-printer matchers to fail to match.  This tracks that
    change.
    
    Updated runtime-gdb_test.go to include a slice and a channel printing test.
    
    (The straightforward printing of a slicevar doesn't work because
    of compiler DWARF problems describing the slicevar, not gdb problems).
