    [dev.link] cmd/compile: make compiler-generated ppc64 TOC symbols static
    
    Set the AttrStatic flag on compiler-emitted TOC symbols for ppc64; these
    symbols don't need to go into the final symbol table in Go binaries.
    This fixes a buglet introduced by CL 240539 that was causing failures
    on the aix builder.
