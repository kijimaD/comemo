    cmd/go: remove tests that assume lack of new versions of external modules
    
    In general it seems ok to assume that an open-source module that did
    exist will continue to do so — after all, users of open-source modules
    already do that all the time. However, we should not assume that those
    modules do not publish new versions — that's really up to their
    maintainers to decide.
    
    Two existing tests did make that assumption for the module
    gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2. Let's remove those two tests.
    If we need to replace them at some point, we can replace them with
    hermetic test-only modules (#54503) or perhaps modules owned by the Go
    project.
    
    Fixes #58445.
