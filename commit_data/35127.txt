    cmd/go: fix go list .Stale computation
    
    If X depends on Y and X was installed but Y is only present in the cache
    (as happens when you "go install X") then we should report X as up-to-date,
    not as stale.
    
    This applies whether X is a package or a main binary.
    
    Fixes #24558.
    Fixes #23818.
