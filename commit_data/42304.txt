    runtime: grow stack more than 2x if the new frame is large
    
    We might as well grow the stack at least as large as we'll need for
    the frame that is calling morestack. It doesn't help with the
    lots-of-small-frames case, but it may help a bit with the
    few-big-frames case.
    
    Update #18138
