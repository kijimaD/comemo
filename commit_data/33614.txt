    cmd/compile: bug fixes for DWARF location lists
    
    Fix two small but serious bugs in the DWARF location list code that
    should have been caught by the automated tests I didn't write.
    
    After emitting debug information for a user variable, mark it as done
    so that it doesn't get emitted again. Otherwise it would be written once
    per slot it was decomposed into.
    
    Correct a merge error in CL 44350: the location list abbreviations need
    to have DW_AT_decl_line too, otherwise the resulting DWARF is gibberish.
