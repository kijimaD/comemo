    syscall: fix Open param names
    
    syscall.Open param names are confusing, mainly because what should be
    named flag is named mode and what should be named mode is named perm.
    
    The name perm is used as synonym for mode in other places, so keep
    it as is. Rename mode to flag to match the real meaning of the
    parameter. Also, rename path to name for consistency with other
    usage of the same parameter.
