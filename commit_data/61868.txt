    cmd/go: report tool errors in go list all
    
    Before tools there was no way to directly import a package in another
    module, and so missing packages were always marked as "all" due to being
    dependencies of a package in a main module.
    
    Tools break that assumption, and so to report errors in tool packages
    correctly we need to mark packages as being in "all" even if they do not
    exist.
    
    Fixes #70582
