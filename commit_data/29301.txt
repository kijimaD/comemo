    encoding/json: Use a lookup table for safe characters
    
    The previous check for characters inside of a JSON string that needed
    to be escaped performed seven different boolean comparisons before
    determining that a ASCII character did not need to be escaped. Most
    characters do not need to be escaped, so this check can be done in a
    more performant way.
    
    Use the same strategy as the unicode package for precomputing a range
    of characters that need to be escaped, then do a single lookup into a
    character array to determine whether the character needs escaping.

    I also took the data set reported in #5683 (browser
    telemetry data from Mozilla), added named structs for
    the data set, and turned it into a proper benchmark:
    https://github.com/kevinburke/jsonbench/blob/master/go/bench_test.go
    
    The results from that test are similarly encouraging. On a 64-bit
    Mac:
    
    $ benchstat benchmarks/master-benchmark benchmarks/json-table-benchmark
    name              old time/op    new time/op    delta

    Unmarshal-4       31.0MB/s ± 2%  31.2MB/s ± 1%   +0.83%  (p=0.025 n=22+17)
    
    On the c4.large:
    
    $ benchstat benchmarks/master-bench benchmarks/json-table-bench
    name              old time/op    new time/op    delta
    CodeMarshal-2       1.10ms ± 1%    0.98ms ± 1%  -10.12%  (p=0.000 n=20+54)
    Unmarshal-2         2.82ms ± 1%    2.79ms ± 0%   -1.09%  (p=0.000 n=20+51)
    UnmarshalReuse-2    2.80ms ± 0%    2.77ms ± 0%   -1.03%  (p=0.000 n=20+52)
    
    name              old speed      new speed      delta
    CodeMarshal-2     87.3MB/s ± 1%  97.1MB/s ± 1%  +11.27%  (p=0.000 n=20+54)
    Unmarshal-2       33.9MB/s ± 1%  34.2MB/s ± 0%   +1.10%  (p=0.000 n=20+51)
    
    For what it's worth, I tried other heuristics - short circuiting the
    conditional for common ASCII characters, for example:
    
    if (b >= 63 && b != 92) || (b >= 39 && b <= 59) || (rest of the conditional)
    
    This offered a speedup around 7-9%, not as large as the submitted
    change.
