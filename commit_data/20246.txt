    runtime: fix race detector running Go code on g0 of non-main thread
    
    It looks like this has just always been broken:
    the race detector handles running Go code on g0 of the main thread
    and on g0 of any extra threads created by non-Go code, but it does
    not handle running Go code on g0 of non-main threads created by Go.
    Handle that.
    
    Should fix the race build failures on the dashboard.
    
    We're running into this now because we are running more
    and more Go code on g0.
