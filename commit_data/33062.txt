    cmd/link: fix some unintentional symbol creation
    
    There are two places in DWARF generation that create symbols when they
    really just want to get the symbol if it exists. writeranges, in
    particular, will create a DWARF range symbol for every single textp
    symbol (though they won't get linked into any list, so they don't
    affect the binary).
    
    Fix these to use ROLookup instead of Lookup.
