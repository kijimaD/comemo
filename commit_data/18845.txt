    runtime: use unoptimized memmove and memclr on Plan 9
    
    On Plan 9, the kernel disallows the use of floating point
    instructions while handling a note. Previously, we worked
    around this by using a simple loop in place of memmove.
    
    When I added that work-around, I verified that all paths
    from the note handler didn't end up calling memmove. Now
    that memclr is using SSE instructions, the same process
    will have to be done again.
    
    Instead of doing that, however, this CL just punts and
    uses unoptimized functions everywhere on Plan 9.
