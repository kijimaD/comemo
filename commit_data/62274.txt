    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: support MOVD with floating point constants
    
    Currently, we only support loading of values from memory (or other
    registers). Add floating point constant support to MOVD. This is
    implemented by storing the floating point constant to a symbol,
    which is then loaded into the floating point register.
