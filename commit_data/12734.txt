commit 1d8ec87135d109aebbac5631bda9c2af37f5d593
Author: Adam Langley <agl@golang.org>

    crypto/tls: don't select ECC ciphersuites with no mutual curve.
    
    The existing code that tried to prevent ECC ciphersuites from being
    selected when there were no mutual curves still left |suite| set.
    This lead to a panic on a nil pointer when there were no acceptable
    ciphersuites at all.
    
    Thanks to George Kadianakis for pointing it out.
