    go/types: resolve cgo base type names
    
    When associating methods with their receiver base, we need to implement
    the same indirection through Cgo types as is done for selector
    expressions. This fixes a bug where methods declared on aliases of Cgo
    types were not associated with their receiver.
    
    While porting to types2, align the types2 testFiles helper with the
    go/types implementation. In order to avoid call-site bloat, switch to an
    options pattern for configuring the Config used to type-check.
    
    Fixes golang/go#59944
