    runtime: tricky replacements of _g_ in proc.go
    
    This manually replaces uses of _g_ that cannot be trivially switched to
    gp since there is another gp variable in scope.
    
    Most of these functions only use the current g to reach the m, so this
    helps with clarity by switching all accesses directly to an mp variable.
