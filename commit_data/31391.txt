    cmd/link: set pe section and file alignment to 0 during external linking
    
    This is what gcc does when it generates object files.
    And it is easier to count everything, when it starts from 0.
    Make go linker do the same.
    
    gcc also does not output IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER or
    PE64_IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER for object files.
    Perhaps we should do the same, but not in this CL.
    
    For #10776.
