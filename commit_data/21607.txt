    cmd/gc: eliminate some pointer arithmetic
    
    In mparith, all the a1-- are problematic. Rewrite it all without pointers.
    It's clearer anyway.
    
    In popt, v is problematic because it is used both as a fixed pointer
    (v = byvar[i]) and as a moving pointer (v = var; v++) aka slice.
    Eliminate pointer movement.
    
    Tested that this still produces bit-for-bit output for 'go build -a std'
    compared to d260756 (current master).
