    net/http/httputil: copy header map if necessary in ReverseProxy
    
    We were already making a copy of the map before removing
    hop-by-hop headers. This commit does the same for proxied
    headers mentioned in the "Connection" header.
    
    A test is added to ensure request headers are not modified.
    
    Updates #16875
