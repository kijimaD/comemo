    cmd/yacc: fix default action
    
    Previously, a production rule like
    
            A: B C D
    
    would cause yacc to check that A and B have the same declared types,
    but then it would generate an implicit action of { $$ = $3 } (i.e.,
    copy the value from D), even if A and D have different types.
    
    Fixes #10192.
