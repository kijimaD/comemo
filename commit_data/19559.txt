    misc/emacs: replace hacky go--delete-whole-line with own implementation
    
    Using flet to replace kill-region with delete-region was a hack,
    flet is now (GNU Emacs 24.3) deprecated and at least two people
    have reported an issue where using go--delete-whole-line would
    permanently break their kill ring. While that issue is probably
    caused by faulty third party code (possibly prelude), it's easier
    to write a clean implementation than to tweak the hack.
