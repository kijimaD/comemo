    crypto/elliptic: add constant-time, P-256 implementation.
    
    On my 64-bit machine, despite being 32-bit code, fixed-base
    multiplications are 7.1x faster and arbitary multiplications are 2.6x
    faster.
    
    It is difficult to review this change. However, the code is essentially
    the same as code that has been open-sourced in Chromium. There it has
    been successfully performing P-256 operations for several months on
    many machines so the arithmetic of the code should be sound.
