    cmd/compile: modify -memprofile flag for multiple profiles in a directory
    
    This permits collection of multiple profiles in a build
    (instead of just the last compilation).  If a -memprofile
    specifies an existing directory instead of a file, it will
    create "<url.PathEscape(pkgpath)>.mprof" in that directory.
    
    The PathEscaped package names are ugly, but this puts all
    the files in a single directory with no risk of name clashs,
    which simplies the usual case for using these files, which
    is something like
    ```
    go tool pprof profiles/*.mprof
    ```
    
    Creating a directory tree mimicking the package structure
    requires something along the lines of
    ```
    go tool pprof `find profiles -name "*.mprof" -print`
    ```
    
    In addition, this turns off "legacy format" because that
    is only useful for a benchcompile, which does not use this
    new feature (and people actually interested in memory
    profiles probably prefer the new ones).
