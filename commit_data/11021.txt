    dashboard: increase notification log to 200 lines
    
    The go command lists all packages that were built.
    A recent breakage notification included this text:
    
    $ tail -100 < log
    ok      errors
    ok      exp/ebnf
    ?       exp/ebnflint [no test files]
    ok      exp/gotype
    ok      exp/norm
    ok      exp/spdy
    
    If the breakage occurred before this point it would
    not be visible in the output.
