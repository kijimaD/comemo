    crypto/x509: document AuthorityKeyId and don't mutate it.
    
    The AuthorityKeyId value from the template was used by
    CreateCertificate, but that wasn't documented. Also, CreateCertificate
    would stash a value in the template if it needed to override it, which
    was wrong: template should be read-only.
    
    Fixes #18962.
