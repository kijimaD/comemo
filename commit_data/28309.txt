    net, net/http: don't trace UDP dials
    
    The httptrace.ConnectStart and ConnectDone hooks are just about the
    post-DNS connection to the host. We were accidentally also firing on
    the UDP dials to DNS. Exclude those for now. We can add them back
    later as separate hooks if desired. (but they'd only work for pure Go
    DNS)
    
    This wasn't noticed earlier because I was developing on a Mac at the
    time, which always uses cgo for DNS. When running other tests on
    Linux, I started seeing UDP dials.
