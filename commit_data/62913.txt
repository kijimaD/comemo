    runtime: clear frame pointer in mcall
    
    On amd64, mcall leaves BP untouched, so the callback will push BP,
    connecting the g0 stack to the calling g stack. This seems OK (frame
    pointer unwinders like Linux perf can see what user code called into the
    scheduler), but the "scheduler" part is problematic.
    
    mcall is used when calling into the scheduler to deschedule the current
    goroutine (e.g., in goyield). Once the goroutine is descheduled, it may
    be picked up by another M and continue execution. The other thread is
    mutating the goroutine stack, but our M still has a frame pointer
    pointing to the goroutine stack.
    
    A frame pointer unwinder like Linux perf could get bogus values off of
    the mutating stack. Note that though the execution tracer uses
    framepointer unwinding, it never unwinds a g0, so it isn't affected.
    
    Clear the frame pointer in mcall so that unwinding always stops at
    mcall.
    
    On arm64, mcall stores the frame pointer from g0.sched.bp. This doesn't
    really make any sense. mcall wasn't called by whatever used g0 last, so
    at best unwinding will get misleading results (e.g., it might look like
    cgocallback calls mcall?).
    
    Also clear the frame pointer on arm64.
    
    Other architectures don't use frame pointers.
    
    For #63630.
