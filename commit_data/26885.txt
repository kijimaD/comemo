    reflect: test that Call results are not addressable
    
    Gccgo was erroneously marking Call results as addressable, which led to
    an obscure bug using text/template, as text/template calls CanAddr to
    check whether to take the address of a value when looking up methods.
    When a function returned a pointer, and CanAddr was true, the result was
    a pointer to a pointer that had no methods.
    
    Fixed in gccgo by https://golang.org/cl/21908.  Adding the test here so
    that it doesn't regress.
