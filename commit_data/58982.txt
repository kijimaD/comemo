    runtime: disable use of runnext on wasm
    
    When readying a goroutine, the scheduler typically places the readied
    goroutine in pp.runnext, which will typically be the next goroutine to
    run in the schedule.
    
    In order to prevent a set of ping-pong goroutines from simply switching
    back and forth via runnext and starving the rest of the run queue, a
    goroutine scheduled via runnext shares a time slice (pp.schedtick) with
    the previous goroutine.
    
    sysmon detects "long-running goroutines", which really means Ps using
    the same pp.schedtick for too long, and preempts them to allow the rest
    of the run queue to run. Thus this avoids starvation via runnext.
    
    However, wasm has no threads, and thus no sysmon. Without sysmon to
    preempt, the possibility for starvation returns. Avoid this by disabling
    runnext entirely on wasm. This means that readied goroutines always go
    on the end of the run queue and thus cannot starve via runnext.
    
    Note that this CL doesn't do anything about single long-running
    goroutines. Without sysmon to preempt them, a single goroutine that
    fails to yield will starve the run queue indefinitely.
    
    For #65178.
