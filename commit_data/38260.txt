    cmd/compile: provide types for all order-allocated temporaries
    
    Ensure that we correctly type the stack temps for regular closures,
    method function closures, and slice literals.
    
    Then we don't need to override the dummy types later.
    Furthermore, this allows order to reuse temporaries of these types.
    
    OARRAYLIT doesn't need a temporary as far as I can tell, so I
    removed that case from order.
