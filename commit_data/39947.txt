    debug/dwarf: expose file name table from line table reader
    
    Currently, the line table reader keeps the file name table internal.
    However, there are various attributes like AttrDeclFile and
    AttrCallFile whose value is an index into this table. Hence, in order
    to interpret these attributes, we need access to the file name table.
    
    This CL adds a method to LineReader that exposes the file table of the
    current compilation unit in order to allow consumers to interpret
    attributes that index into this table.
