    reflect: store receiver in pointer slot for reflect call
    
    The code comment says that the receiver doesn't need to go into
    the pointer slot as it will be kept alive in this frame. But it
    doesn't. There is no direct reference of rcvr or v (the receiver)
    after storing the arguments. Also, it is clearer to explicitly
    keep it alive.
    
    Fixes #52800.
