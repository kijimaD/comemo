commit bb09f8a29b04b8fe4465d0b5d92f164979ee9213

    time: make time.Time print a valid Go string with %#v
    
    Previously calling fmt.Sprintf("%#v", t) on a time.Time value would
    yield a result like:
    
        time.Time{wall:0x0, ext:63724924180, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}
    
    which does not compile when embedded in a Go program, and does not
    tell you what value is represented at a glance.
    
    This change adds a GoString method that returns much more legible
    output:
    
        "time.Date(2009, time.February, 5, 5, 0, 57, 12345600, time.UTC)"
    
    which gives you more information about the time.Time and also can be
    usefully embedded in a Go program without additional work.
    
    Update Quote() to hex escape non-ASCII characters (copying logic
    from strconv), which makes it safer to embed them in the output of
    GoString().
    
    Fixes #39034.
