    database/sql: wake cleaner if maxIdleTime set to less than maxLifetime
    
    The existing implementation wouldn't wake the connection cleaner if
    maxIdleTime was set to a value less than maxLifetime while an existing
    connection was open - resulting in idle connections not being discarded
    until after the first maxLifetime had passed.
    
    Fixes #45993
