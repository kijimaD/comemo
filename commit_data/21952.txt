    [dev.cc] all: edit assembly source for ARM to be more regular
    
    Several .s files for ARM had several properties the new assembler will not support.
    These include:
    
    - mentioning SP or PC as a hardware register
            These are always pseudo-registers except that in some contexts
            they're not, and it's confusing because the context should not affect
            which register you mean. Change the references to the hardware
            registers to be explicit: R13 for SP, R15 for PC.
    - constant creation using assignment
            The files say a=b when they could instead say #define a b.
            There is no reason to have both mechanisms.
    - R(0) to refer to R0.
            Some macros use this to a great extent. Again, it's easy just to
            use a #define to rename a register.
