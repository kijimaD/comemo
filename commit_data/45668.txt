    runtime: wait for Go runtime to initialize in Windows signal test
    
    The test harness waits for "ready" as a sign that the Go runtime has
    installed its signal handler and is ready to be tested. But actually,
    while LoadLibrary starts the loading of the Go runtime, it does so
    asynchronously, so the "ready" sign is potentially premature and
    certainly racy. However, all exported cgo entry points make a call to
    _cgo_wait_runtime_init_done which waits for that asynchronous
    initialization to complete. Therefore, this commit fixes the test to
    call into the exported "Dummy" cgo function before emitting the "ready"
    sign, so that we're sure the Go runtime is actually loaded.
    
    Updates #45638.
