    cmd/go/internal/work: do not write trivial.c when testing gcc flags
    
    CL 61111 disabled the writing of trivial.c in -n mode, which
    made -n mode at least inconsistent with regular mode in
    how it was testing for flags. We think that both were getting
    the same answer, so avoid creating the file in both modes
    to make sure.
    
    If this CL turns out to be wrong, then when we revert it we
    should make sure that the empty file is written even in -n mode,
    because this check affects the command-line flags printed
    by other commands in that mode.
