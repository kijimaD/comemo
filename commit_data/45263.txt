    cmd/compile: don't accumulate duplicated named slots
    
    Currently, in expand_calls, for each appearance of a named
    variables's component, we add the named slot to f.Names list. If
    a variable appears many times, we add it to f.Names many times.
    Furthure, for each duplicated named slot, its entry in
    f.NamedValues is a slice that contains all Values associated with
    that name. This leads to quadratic behavior when iterating named
    values like
    
            for _, name := range f.Names {
                    for _, v := range f.NamedValues[name] {
                            ...
                    }
            }
    
    This CL makes it not to add duplicated entries to f.Names.
