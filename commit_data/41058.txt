    runtime: remove unnecessary variable decls in asm.s
    
    runtime/asm.s contains two variable declarations that don't seem
    needed. The variables are defined in Go and not referenced in
    assembly. They were added in 2014 during the C to Go transition.
    Maybe they were useful at that time, but not now. Remove them.
