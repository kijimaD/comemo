    runtime: update triggerRatio in setGCPercent
    
    Currently, runtime/debug.SetGCPercent does not adjust the controller
    trigger ratio. As a result, runtime reductions of GOGC don't take full
    effect until after one more concurrent cycle has happened, which
    adjusts the trigger ratio to account for the new gcpercent.
    
    Fix this by lowering the trigger ratio if necessary in setGCPercent.
