    cmd/go: replace a TODO with an explanatory comment
    
    I left a TODO to decide whether to add 'go get' arguments as indirect
    (as we have in the past), or to make them direct. I considered both
    options, and decided to keep the indirect default because it is easier
    (and less invasive) for users to fix.
    
    Updates #45979
