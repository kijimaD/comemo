    androidtest.bash: copy pkg for gcimporter tests
    
    The tests for go/types depend on reading gc export data from the
    $GOROOT/pkg directory. This is the first use of these files as
    testdata, so previously they were not copied to the android device.
    Now they are used, copy them.
    
    Fixes android/arm build.
