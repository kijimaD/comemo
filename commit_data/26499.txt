    misc/cgo/testcarchive: re-enable c-archive test on iOS and Android
    
    The c-archive test were recently converted from shell script to Go.
    Unfortunately, it also lost the ability to target iOS and Android
    that lack C compilers and require exec wrappers.
    
    Compile the c-archive test for the host and run it with the target
    GOOS/GOARCH environment. Change the test to rely on go env GOOS
    and go env GOARCH instead of runtime.GOOS and runtime.GOARCH.
    
    Fixes #8345
