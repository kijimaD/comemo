    debug/dwarf: document DWARF class -> Go type mapping
    
    Currently, the only way to know the Go type of an attribute of some
    DWARF attribute class was to read the dwarf package code (or
    experiment).  This makes it hard to go from the DWARF specification to
    writing code that uses the dwarf package.
    
    Fix this by adding a table to the documentation comment of the Field
    type that gives the correspondence between DWARF attribute classes and
    Go types.
