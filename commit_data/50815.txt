    os/exec: delete TestExtraFilesFDShuffle
    
    This test has been disabled for over nine years (since CL 12869049).
    Although it still compiles, it seems likely to have rotted since then,
    and if it was going to detect a real bug it also seems like that bug
    would have been encountered and reported by users since then (and
    would presumably have its own regression tests).
    
    To eliminate overhead from mainining it (or skipping over it while
    maintaining other tests), let's just delete it.
    
    Fixes #5780.
