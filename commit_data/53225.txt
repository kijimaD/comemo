    cmd/dist: require Go 1.17 for building Go
    
    This makes builds using earlier Go bootstrap versions fail pretty clearly:
    
    % GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$HOME/sdk/go1.16 ./make.bash
    Building Go cmd/dist using /Users/rsc/sdk/go1.16. (go1.16 darwin/amd64)
    found packages main (build.go) and building_Go_requires_Go_1_17_or_later (notgo117.go) in /Users/rsc/go/src/cmd/dist
    %
    
    All the builders have Go 1.17 or later for bootstrap now except
    for the android corellium builders, which still need updating (#54246).
    We are accepting breakage on those for now.
    
    Fixes #44505.
