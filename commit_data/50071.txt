    time: add doc comment about tzdata package
    
    Add doc comment about the time/tzdata package to the time.LoadLocation
    function. The time.LoadLocation function was changed in Go 1.15 to add an extra
    source that it considers for the time zone database. That location is the
    time/tzdata package. It is not easy to discover this behavior because the
    documentation for the time package doesn't mention it in the discussion on the
    time.LoadLocation function when discussing the different sources. It would be helpful to
    describe all possible sources that time.LoadLocation considers when loading the
    time zone database, and so I think it would be worthwhile to mention
    time/tzdata.
