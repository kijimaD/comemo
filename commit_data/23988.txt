    runtime: repeat bitmap for slice of GCprog n-1 times, not n times
    
    Currently, to write out the bitmap of a slice of a type with a GCprog,
    we construct a new GCprog that executes the underlying type's GCprog
    to write out the bitmap once and then repeats those bits n more times.
    This results in n+1 repetitions of the bitmap, which is one more
    repetition than it should be. This corrupts the bitmap of the heap
    following the slice and may write past the mapped bitmap memory and
    segfault.
    
    Fix this by repeating the bitmap only n-1 more times.
    
    Fixes #11430.
