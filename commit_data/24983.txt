    runtime: fix hashing of trace stacks
    
    The call to hash the trace stack reversed the "seed" and "size"
    arguments to memhash and, hence, always called memhash with a 0 size,
    which dutifully returned a hash value that depended only on the number
    of PCs in the stack and not their values. As a result, all stacks were
    put in to a very subset of the 8,192 buckets.
    
    Fix this by passing these arguments in the correct order.
