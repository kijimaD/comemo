    cmd/go: flip relationship between load and modload
    
    Previously, modload imported load, but it mainly just did so in order
    to install callbacks to the modload API. This was important during vgo
    development, but there's no longer a strong reason to do this. Nothing
    modload imports strongly depends on load, so there's little danger of
    a dependency cycle.
    
    This change deletes the callbacks in load and instead, makes load call
    exported functions in modload directly. In the future, these functions
    may have different signatures than their GOPATH counterparts.
