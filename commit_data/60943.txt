    runtime: add asm_riscv64.h
    
    asm_riscv64.h will be used to define macros for each riscv64
    extension that is not part of the rva20u64 base profile but that the
    _riscv64.s assembly files are allowed to use because the user has
    specified a more capable profile in the GORISCV64 variable. This will
    allow us, for example, to test for the hasZba macro in those assembly
    files instead of the GORISCV64_rva22u64 macro before using a Zba
    instruction.  This is important as it means that in the future when
    we add support for new profiles that support Zba, e.g., rva23u64,
    we only need to update asm_riscv64.h to indicate rva23u64 supports
    Zba.  We will not need to update every assembly language file that
    already uses Zba instructions.
