    reflect: remove deprecation notices from SliceHeader, StringHeader
    
    There has been no proposal discussion about adding these notices.
    Also, even if we did decide to add them, then since their replacements
    are only appearing in Go 1.20, go.dev/wiki/Deprecation says that we
    should wait until Go 1.22 to add the deprecation notice.
    
    Filed #56906 for the proposal discussion.
    
    Fixes #56905.
