    [release-branch.go1.23] runtime: reserve 4kB for system stack on windows-386
    
    The failures in #70288 are consistent with and strongly imply
    stack corruption during fault handling, and debug prints show
    that the Go code run during fault handling is running about
    300 bytes above the bottom of the goroutine stack.
    That should be okay, but that implies the DLL code that called
    Go's handler was running near the bottom of the stack too,
    and maybe it called other deeper things before or after the
    Go handler and smashed the stack that way.
    
    stackSystem is already 4096 bytes on amd64;
    making it match that on 386 makes the flaky failures go away.
    It's a little unsatisfying not to be able to say exactly what is
    overflowing the stack, but the circumstantial evidence is
    very strong that it's Windows.
    
    For #70288.
    Fixes #70475.
