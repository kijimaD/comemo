    cmd/compile: add automated rewrite cycle detection
    
    A common bug during development is to introduce rewrite rule cycles.
    This is annoying because it takes a while to notice that
    make.bash is a bit too slow this time, and to remember why.
    And then you have to manually arrange to debug.
    
    Make this all easier by automating it.
    Detect cycles, and when we detect one, print the sequence
    of rewrite rules that occur within a single cycle before crashing.
