    cmd/go/internal/modget: split resolveCandidates into two methods
    
    It turns out that the existing call sites of the resolveCandidates
    method pass only *either* a slice of queries or a slice of upgrades
    (never both), and the behaviors triggered by the two parameters don't
    overlap much at all. To clarify the two different operations, split
    them into two separate methods.
    
    For #36460
