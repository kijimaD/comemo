    cmd/cgo: allow cgo to pass strings or []bytes bigger than 1<<30
    
    There's no real reason to limit to 1<<30 bytes. Maybe it would catch
    some mistakes, but probably ones that would quickly manifest in other
    ways.
    
    We can't use the fancy new unsafe.Slice function because this code
    may still be generated for people with 1.16 or earlier in their go.mod file.
    Use unsafe shenanigans instead.
    
    Fixes #53965
    Fixes #53958
