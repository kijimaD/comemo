    runtime: merge timerDeleted into timerModified
    
    When we make a change to a timer, we have to note the
    desired change to t.when and then wait for the timer heap
    owner to apply the change. There are two possible changes:
    delete or set a new t.when. Most of the code for processing
    these changes is the same, so we can simplify the code by
    making both have the same state: timerDeleted is now
    timerModified with t.nextwhen == 0.
    
    This is part of a larger simplification of the state set.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
