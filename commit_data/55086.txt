    runtime/coverage: add missing file close in test support helper
    
    The processPod() helper (invoked by processCoverTestDir, which is in
    turn called by _testmain.go) was opening and reading counter data
    files, but never closing them. Add a call to close the files after
    they have been read.
    
    Fixes #57407.
