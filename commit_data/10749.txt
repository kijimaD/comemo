    go: implement doc, fmt, fix, list, vet
    
    This CL is concerned with the basic Package structure
    and applies it to the (trivial) implementations of the
    doc, fmt, fix, list, and vet commands.
    
    The command as a whole is still very much a work in progress.
    In particular, work making the error messages look nice
    is deferred to a future CL.
