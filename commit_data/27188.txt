    net: remove internal support for obsolete DNS record types
    
    There are no real world use cases for HINFO, MINFO, MB, MG, or MR
    records, and package net's exposed APIs don't provide any way to
    access them even if there were. If a use ever does show up, we can
    revive them. In the mean time, this is just effectively-dead code that
    sticks around because of rr_mk.
