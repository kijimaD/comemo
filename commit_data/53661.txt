    net/http: mention io.Seeker requirement in FS documentation
    
    Both FileServer and NewFileTransport can try to seek a file, specifically
    when MIME type sniffing is performed. This can be somewhat surprising to an
    implementer of an fs.FS, as their filesystem will appear to work until a
    user tries to access a file with an unrecognized extension (which requires
    type sniffing and therefore seeking). With FileServer, this results in a
    "seeker can't seek" message, which is not very clear for the developer.
    
    The issue arises because fs.FS does not require Seek, while http.FileSystem
    does. Therefore, this change adds a line to the documentation of net/http's
    adapter function mentioning the requirement.
