    bufio: make Reader.Peek invalidate Unreads
    
    Since Reader.Peek potentially reads from the underlying io.Reader,
    discarding previous buffers, UnreadRune and UnreadByte cannot
    necessarily work.  Change Peek to invalidate the unread buffers in all
    cases (as allowed according to the documentation) and thus prevent
    hiding bugs in the caller.
    
    (This change was previoiusly merged and then reverted due concern about
    being too close to a release)
    
    Fixes #18556
