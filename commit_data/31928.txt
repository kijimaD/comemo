    cmd/compile: suppress errors after "cannot assign to X"
    
    If the LHS is unassignable, there's no point in trying to make sure
    the RHS can be assigned to it or making sure they're realizable
    types. This is consistent with go/types.
    
    In particular, this prevents "1 = 2" from causing a panic when "1"
    still ends up with the type "untyped int", which is not realizable.
    
    Fixes #20813.
