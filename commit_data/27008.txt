    cmd/compile: static composite literals are side-effect free
    
    This extends CL 22192.
    
    This removes the remaining performance disparity
    between non-SSA and SSA on the AppendInPlace benchmarks.
    
    Going from non-SSA to SSA:
    
    AppendInPlace/NoGrow/2Ptr-8  1.60µs ± 5%  1.53µs ± 5%  -4.04%  (p=0.000 n=15+14)
    AppendInPlace/NoGrow/3Ptr-8  2.04µs ± 3%  1.96µs ± 2%  -3.90%  (p=0.000 n=13+14)
    AppendInPlace/NoGrow/4Ptr-8  2.83µs ± 8%  2.62µs ± 4%  -7.39%  (p=0.000 n=13+15)
    
    Previously these were 20% regressions.
