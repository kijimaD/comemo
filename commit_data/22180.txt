    misc/ios: timeout and continue waiting for getwd
    
    Split out from cl/8024 for clarity and improved approach.
    
    Rarely, "stop reason = breakpoint" does not appear in the lldb stop
    text. However the program is ready to proceed. To be a little more
    robust about those cases, we wait for two seconds, and if that text
    doesn't appear but a prompt does we continue and hope for the best.
    Worst case, this results in a harder to read failure message.
