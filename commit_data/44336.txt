    runtime: raise alert threshold on window smhasher test
    
    This alert is triggering occasionally. I've investigated the
    collisions that happen, and they all seem to be pairwise, so they are
    not a big deal.  "pairwise" = when there are 32 collisions, it is two
    keys mapping to the same hash, 32 times, not 33 keys all mapping to
    the same hash.
    
    Add some t.Logf calls in case this comes back, which will help isolate
    the problem.
    
    Fixes #39352
