    runtime/internal/atomic: remove write barrier from Storep1 on s390x
    
    atomic.Storep1 is not supposed to invoke a write barrier (that's what
    atomicstorep is for), but currently does on s390x. This causes a panic
    in runtime.mapzero when it tries to use atomic.Storep1 to store what's
    actually a scalar.
    
    Fix this by eliminating the write barrier from atomic.Storep1 on
    s390x. Also add some documentation to atomicstorep to explain the
    difference between these.
    
    Fixes #15270.
