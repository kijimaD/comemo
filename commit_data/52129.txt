    cmd/go: skip TestDocsUpToDate if 'go build' is not supported
    
    testGo is currently only configured if testenv.HasGoBuild returns
    true, which implies that a complete toolchain is present.
    Since setting up testGo now only uses the test binary itself, it does
    not actually require 'go build', but fixing that will be a bit more
    involved. For now, just skip the test when it isn't set up.
    
    Fixes #58775.
