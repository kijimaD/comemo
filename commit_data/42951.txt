    cmd/link: record only the first occurance in Reachparent graph
    
    In the deadcode pass, a type symbol may be marked twice, one
    without UsedInIface, one with. For the second time, don't
    update the Reachparent graph, so it only records the path of
    the first time the symbol is reached. This ensures the
    Reachparent graph is acyclic.
    
    TODO: add a test. (This only affects GOEXPERIMENT=fieldtrack)
