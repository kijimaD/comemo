    test: add a new test absdiff3.go which uses function callback
    
    We have disallowed having a typeparam on the right-hand-side of a type
    declaration. So, we disabled much of the test absdiff.go. I recently
    wrote a new test absdiff2.go to use a structure containing the type
    param type, so I could attach a method properly and run the full test.
    
    As a contrast, I thought I would create absdiff3.go, where the Abs
    functionality is passed in as a function callback (but derived from a
    generic function). This is simpler, and more inline with some of the
    guidelines that Ian has been proposing (use passed-in functions rather
    than requiring methods, when possible, for greater ease-of-use).
    
    Only adds a new test absdiff3.go. (And fixes a comment in absdiff2.go.)
