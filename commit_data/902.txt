commit e45eb6065706c65828bdc97e7522b468cb73312c
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Sat Oct 18 16:42:25 2008 -0700

    Added mechanism for very precise self-testing:
    - in selftest mode (-t) interpret comments of the form /* ERROR */ and /* SYNC */
      and validate reported errors with the error markings in a file
    - added initial selftest.go file
    
    Also:
    - fixed an issue with empty blocks
    - generally report better error messages
    - added many more tests to the test script (essentially all .go programs which
      have no syntax errors)
