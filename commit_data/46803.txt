    cmd/link: don't decode type symbol in shared library in deadcode
    
    In the linker's deadcode pass we decode type symbols for
    interface satisfaction analysis. When linking against Go shared
    libraries, the type symbol may come from a shared library, so it
    doesn't have data in the current module being linked, so we cannot
    decode it. We already have code to skip DYNIMPORT symbols. However,
    this doesn't actually work, because at that point the type symbols'
    names haven't been mangled, whereas they may be mangled in the
    shared library. So the symbol definition (in shared library) and
    reference (in current module) haven't been connected.
    
    Skip decoding type symbols of type Sxxx (along with DYNIMPORT)
    when linkShared.
    
    Note: we cannot skip all type symbols, as we still need to mark
    unexported methods defined in the current module.
    
    Fixes #44031.
