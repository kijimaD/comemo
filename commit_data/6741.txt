commit 56bfe95e7f9abcc38d8cbe93f54f6e9a96b22944

    go/ast: change embedded token.Position fields to named fields
    
    This is in preparation for a different position representation.
    It also resolves situations where a node would be printed as
    it's node position simply because the embedded token.Position
    has a String method.
