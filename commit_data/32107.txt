    runtime: initialize more fields of stack spans
    
    Stack spans don't internally use many of the fields of the mspan,
    which means things like the size class and element size get left over
    from whatever last used the mspan. This can lead to confusing crashes
    and debugging.
    
    Zero these fields or initialize them to something reasonable. This
    also lets us simplify some code that currently has to distinguish
    between heap and stack spans.
