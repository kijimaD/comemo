    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of check.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/check.go
    and check.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker.
    
    The primary differences to go/types/check.go are:
    - use of syntax instead of go/ast package
    - tracing is controlled via flag not the "trace" constant
