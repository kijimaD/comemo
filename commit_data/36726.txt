    cmd/link: revert DWARF version to 2 for .debug_lines
    
    On OSX 10.12 and earlier, paired with XCode 9.0,
    specifying DWARF version 3 causes dsymutil to misbehave.
    Version 2 appears to be good enough to allow processing
    of the prologue_end opcode on (at least one version of)
    Linux and OSX 10.13.
    
    Fixes #25451.
