    runtime: rename _p_ to pp
    
    _g_, _p_, and _m_ are primarily vestiges of the C version of the
    runtime, while today we prefer Go-style variable names (generally gp,
    pp, and mp).
    
    This change replaces all remaining uses of _p_ with pp. These are all
    trivial replacements (i.e., no conflicts). That said, there are several
    functions that refer to two different Ps at once. There the naming
    convention is generally that pp refers to the local P, and p2 refers to
    the other P we are accessing.
