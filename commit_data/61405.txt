    syscall: mark SyscallN as noescape
    
    syscall.SyscallN is implemented by runtime.syscall_syscalln, which makes
    sure that the variadic argument doesn't escape.
    
    There is no need to worry about the lifetime of the elements of the
    variadic argument, as the compiler will keep them live until the
    function returns.
    
    Fixes #70197.
