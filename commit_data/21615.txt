    test: deflake init1.go test, tighten its bounds
    
    Per the comment at top, this test is about whether the GC runs during
    init, but it was testing more than that, and testing how much the GC
    collected in a certain amount of time.
    
    Instead, loosen this test to just see whether it ran at all and not
    how well it did.
    
    Fixes #9848
