    cmd/compile: refactor variadac call desugaring
    
    In mid-Walk, we rewrite calls to variadic functions to use explicit
    slice literals; e.g., rewriting f(a,b,c) into f([]T{a,b,c}...).
    However, it would be useful to do that rewrite much earlier in the
    compiler, so that other compiler passes can be simplified.
    
    This CL refactors the rewrite logic into a new fixVariadicCall
    function, which subsequent CLs can more easily move into earlier
    compiler passes.
    
    Passes toolstash-check -race.
