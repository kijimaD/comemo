    os: fix missing break bug in earlier CL 110295's use of Uname
    
    The Uname name was never being used because it always generated a
    too-long string.
    
    The new test looking for zero bytes wouldn't have caught it (I thought
    it would've), but is still nice to have.
    
    Updates #24701
