commit 548c65a568e14490f1a6b80e92c175e2410ddf20

    spec: add another sentence about BOMs
    Although one may argue that they should be legal, gc (at least)
    disallows byte order marks that are not the first code point
    in the file. Added a sentence to the "Implementation restriction"
    clause in the "Source code representation" section to document
    this better.
    
    Lifting this restriction (again - the rule has changed at least
    twice already) would not break any existing programs, should
    we later decide yet again to fiddle the rules about these little
    fly specks.
