    cmd/asm: restore supporting of *1 scaling on ARM64
    
    On ARM64, instruction like "MOVD (R1)(R2*1), R3" is accepted and
    assembles correctly with Go 1.16, but errors out on tip with
    "arm64 doesn't support scaled register format", since CL 289589.
    
    "MOVD (R1)(R2), R3" is the preferred form. But the *1 form works
    before and assembles correctly. Keep supporting it.
    
    Fixes #46766.
