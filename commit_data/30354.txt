    cmd/go: remove _cgo_flags from gccgo archive built using SWIG
    
    Since SWIG uses cgo, when using SWIG with gccgo, the go tool will add a
    _cgo_flags file to the package archive, just as it does with cgo. We
    need to remove that file from the archive passed to the linker, just as
    we do with cgo.
