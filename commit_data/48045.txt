    cmd/go/internal/modload: remove the addedModuleFor map
    
    At one point this map checked for infinite loops during package iteration.
    The last write to the map was mistakenly removed in CL 251445.
    
    However, looking at the code before that change, the map-based
    termination strategy was never quite right to begin with: it checked
    whether we had ever added any module for the given package, not
    whether we had already added the module being proposed right now. (For
    packages within nested modules, we could try adding multiple different
    modules for a given package without looping.)
    
    Moreover, the "looping trying to add package" failure message was only
    marginally helpful. Users are capable of noticing that an invocation
    of the 'go' command is taking too long, and will report a bug for an
    infinite loop just as readily as a "looping trying to add package"
    error.
    
    We could try to add this tracking back in, but it's no substitute for
    a proper proof of convergence, and the code is simpler without it.
    Instead I'm going to add a proper proof of convergence â€” or, barring
    that, a more accurate and useful check for failure to converge. In the
    meantime, this invariantly-empty map isn't doing anybody any good.
    
    For #36460
