    text/template: ensures code consistency in lexer
    
    At the end of lexInsideAction(), we return lexInsideAction: this is the default
    behaviour when we are still parsing an action. But some switch branches return
    lexInsideAction too.
    
    So let's ensure code consistency by always reaching the end of the
    lexInsideAction function when needed.
