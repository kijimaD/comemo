    syscall, internal/syscall/windows: remove utf16PtrToString parameter
    
    CL 208617 introduced syscall.utf16PtrToString and
    internal/syscall/windows.UTF16PtrToString functions.
    
    Original version of CL 208617 did not include syscall.utf16PtrToString
    and internal/syscall/windows.UTF16PtrToString max parameter. The
    parameter was added by Brad at the request of Ian. Ian said:
    
    "In some cases it seems at least possible that the null terminator is
    not present. I think it would be safer if we passed a maximum length
    here."
    
    The syscall.utf16PtrToString and
    internal/syscall/windows.UTF16PtrToString function are designed to work
    with only null terminated strings. So max parameter is superfluous.
    
    This changeÂ removes max parameter.
    
    Updates #34972
