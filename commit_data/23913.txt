    cmd/compile: add case for ODOTTYPE to escwalk
    
    ODOTTYPE should be treated a whole lot like ODOT,
    but it was missing completely from the switch in
    escwalk and thus escape status did not propagate
    to fields.
    
    Since interfaces are required to trigger this bug,
    the test was added to escape_iface.go.
    
    Fixes #11931.
