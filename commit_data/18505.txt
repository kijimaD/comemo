    net/http: increase panic stack trace buffer size from 4 KB to 64 KB.
    
    4 KB is a bit too small in some situations (e.g. panic during a
    template execution), and ends up with an unhelpfully-truncated trace.
    64 KB should be much more likely to capture the useful information.
    There's not a garbage generation issue, since this code should only
    be triggered when there's something seriously wrong with the program.
