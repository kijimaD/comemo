    net/smtp: allow PLAIN auth when advertised
    
    The smtp package originally allowed PLAIN whenever, but then
    the TLS check was added for paranoia, but it's too paranoid:
    it prevents using PLAIN auth even from localhost to localhost
    when the server advertises PLAIN support.
    
    This CL also permits the client to send PLAIN if the server
    advertises it.
    
    Fixes #5184
