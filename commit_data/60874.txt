    os: don't fail TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet if TMPDIR has a symlink
    
    When testing with PWD set, it's possible for the stat of PWD to fail
    with ENAMETOOLONG, and for syscall.Getwd to fail for the same reason.
    If PWD contains symlinks, the fallback code won't know about them.
    If Getwd returns the same result as PWD with resolved symlinks,
    the test should not fail.
