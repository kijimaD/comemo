    cmd/6g, cmd/8g: fix two "out of fixed registers" cases.
    
    In two cases, registers were allocated too early resulting
    in exhausting of available registers when nesting these
    operations.
    
    The case of method calls was due to missing cases in igen,
    which only makes calls but doesn't allocate a register for
    the result.
    
    The case of 8-bit multiplication was due to a wrong order
    in register allocation when Ullman numbers were bigger on the
    RHS.
    
    Fixes #3907.
    Fixes #4156.
