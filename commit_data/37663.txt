    cmd/gofmt: skip gofmt idempotency check on known issue
    
    gofmt's TestAll runs gofmt on all the go files in the tree and checks,
    among other things, that gofmt is idempotent (i.e. that a second
    invocation does not change the input again).
    
    There's a known bug of gofmt not being idempotent (Issue #24472), and
    unfortunately the fixedbugs/issue22662.go file triggers it. We can't
    just gofmt the file, because it tests the effect of various line
    directives inside weirdly-placed comments, and gofmt moves those
    comments, making the test useless.
    
    Instead, just skip the idempotency check when gofmt-ing the
    problematic file.
    
    This fixes go test on the cmd/gofmt package, and a failure seen on the
    longtest builder.
    
    Updates #24472
