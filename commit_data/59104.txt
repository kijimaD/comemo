    cmd/link/internal/ld: unify OS/SDK versions for macOS linking
    
    Go 1.23 will require macOS 11 Big Sur or later, even on AMD64.
    The comment here suggests the main requirement for the OS and
    SDK version is to be recent enough not to break Apple signing,
    and recent enough not to cause other problems.
    
    For now, this CL simplifies the code by merging the ARM64 and
    AMD64 cases into one, given 1.23 will be the first Go release
    with a common minimum macOS version for both architectures so
    there's no need to treat them separately here.
    
    For #64207.
