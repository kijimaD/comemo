    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: prevent panics on bad branches
    
    Syntactically incorrect branches, such as
    
    BEQ     X5, X6, $1
    BEQ     X5, X6, 31(X10)
    
    cause the assembler to panic, which they shouldn't really do.  It's
    better for the user to see a normal error, as reported for other
    syntax errors in riscv64 assembly.  The panics also prevent us
    from writing negative tests for these sorts of errors.
    
    Here we fix the issue by ensuring we generate a normal error instead
    of panicking when the user provides an invalid branch target.  We
    also add a couple of negative tests.
