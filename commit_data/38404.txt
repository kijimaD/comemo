    fmt: put back named results in ss.scanBasePrefix
    
    CL 165619 removed these names when it removed
    the use of the plain 'return'. But the names help for
    documentation purposes even without being mentioned
    directly in the function, so removing them makes the
    code less readable. Put them back. I renamed found
    to zeroFound to make the meaning clearer.
