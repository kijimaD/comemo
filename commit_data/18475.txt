    runtime: fix non-concurrent sweep
    
    State of the world:
    
    CL 46430043 introduced a new concurrent sweep but is broken.
    
    CL 62360043 made the new sweep non-concurrent
    to try to fix the world while we understand what's wrong with
    the concurrent version.
    
    This CL fixes the non-concurrent form to run finalizers.
    This CL is just a band-aid to get the build green again.
    
    Dmitriy is working on understanding and then fixing what's
    wrong with the concurrent sweep.
