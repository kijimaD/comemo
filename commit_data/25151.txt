    net: make /etc/hosts lookups case-insensitive
    
    The native Go host resolver was behaving differently than libc
    and the entries in the /etc/hosts were handled in a case sensitive
    way. In order to be compatible with libc's resolver, /etc/hosts
    lookups must be case-insensitive.
    
    Fixes #12806.
