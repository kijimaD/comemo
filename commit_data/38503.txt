    cmd/go/internal/modfetch: update comment referring to old Import function
    
    The Import function was moved from modfetch/repo.go to modload/import.go
    in vgo CL 122880, and its semantics have changed in vgo CL 123095 to do
    more than just searching for a module. Both of these changes were ported
    to cmd/go in CL 123576.
    
    Delete the mention of the old Import function from the modfetch/repo.go
    comment, since what it refers to does not exist anymore.
