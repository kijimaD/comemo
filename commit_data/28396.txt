    net/http: update bundled http2
    
    Updates x/net/http2 to git rev 202ff482 for https://golang.org/cl/23235 (Expect:
    100-continue support for HTTP/2)
    
    Fixes a flaky test too, and changes the automatic HTTP/2 behavior to
    no longer special-case the DefaultTransport, because
    ExpectContinueTimeout is no longer unsupported by the HTTP/2
    transport.
    
    Fixes #13851
    Fixes #15744
