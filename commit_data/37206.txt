    runtime: only check the existence of variables in gdb info locals test
    
    As discussed in golang.org/cl/28499:
    Only test that all expected variables are listed in 'info locals' since
    different versions of gdb print variables in different order and with
    differing amount of information and formats.
    
    Fixes #28499
