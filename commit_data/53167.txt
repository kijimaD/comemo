    net: ignore more errors in TestDialCancel
    
    TestDialCancel assumes that packets sent to the private IP addresses
    198.18.0.254 and 2001:2::254 will be routed to /dev/null.
    Not all systems are configured that way. We already ignore one
    error case in the test; ignore a couple more than have appeared
    on the builders. The test is still valid as long as some builders
    discard the packets as expected.
    
    Fixes #52579
    Fixes #57364
