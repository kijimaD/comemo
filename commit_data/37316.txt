    cmd/vet: fix printf false negative with nested pointers
    
    Pointers to compound objects (structs, slices, arrays, maps) are only
    followed by fmt if the pointer is at the top level of an argument. This
    is to minimise the chances of fmt running into loops.
    
    However, vet did not follow this rule. It likely doesn't help that fmt
    does not document that restriction well, which is being tracked in
     #28625.
    
    Updates #27672.
