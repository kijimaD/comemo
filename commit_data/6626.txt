    arm: precise float64 software floating point
    
    Adds softfloat64 to generic runtime
    (will be discarded by linker when unused)
    and adds test for it.  I used the test to check
    the software code against amd64 hardware
    and then check the software code against
    the arm and its simulation of hardware.
    The latter should have been a no-op (testing
    against itself) but turned up a bug in 5c causing
    the vlrt.c routines to miscompile.
    
    These changes make the cmath, math,
    and strconv tests pass without any special
    accommodations for arm.
