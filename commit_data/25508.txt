commit 9630c47e8c86a3fabc008eab9f239480b1d4f8e5

    runtime: decentralize concurrent sweep termination
    
    This moves concurrent sweep termination from the coordinator to the
    off->mark transition. This allows it to be performed by all Gs
    attempting to start the GC.
    
    Updates #11970.
