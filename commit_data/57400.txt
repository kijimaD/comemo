    runtime: add deferreturn fast path for linked defers
    
    A consequence of go.dev/cl/513837 was that calling deferreturn would
    now use the unwinder to find (just) the current frame, and it turns
    out there are workloads where this has a significant performance
    impact.
    
    As a simple optimization, this CL adds a fast path for deferreturn to
    detect when there are pending linked defers, which allows us to skip
    invoking the unwinder entirely.
    
    Notably, this still doesn't handle the corner case of calling
    deferreturn in a function that uses linked defer when dynamically
    there just aren't any defers pending. It also means that after
    recovering from a panic and returning to a frame that used open-coded,
    we still need to use the unwinder too.
    
    I hope to further optimize defer handling to improve these cases too,
    but this is an easy, short-term optimization that relieves the
    performance impact to the affected workloads.
