    cmd/compile: disallow linkname referring to instantiations
    
    Linknaming an instantiated generic symbol isn't particularly
    useful: it doesn't guarantee the instantiation exists, and the
    instantiated symbol name may be subject to change. Checked with a
    large code corpus, currently there is no occurrance of linkname
    to an instantiated generic symbol (or symbol with a bracket in its
    name). This also suggests that it is not very useful. Linkname is
    already an unsafe mechanism. We don't need to allow it to do more
    unsafe things without justification.
