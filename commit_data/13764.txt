    cmd/6g: avoid taking the address of slices unnecessarily.
    
    The main case where it happens is when evaluating &s[i] without
    bounds checking, which usually happens during range loops (i=0).
    
    This allows registerization of the corresponding variables,
    saving 16 bytes of stack frame for each such range loop and a
    LEAQ instruction.
