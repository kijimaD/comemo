    net: avoid windows hang in TestCloseWrite
    
    On Windows, reading from a socket at the same time as the other
    end is closing it will occasionally hang. This is a Windows issue, not
    a Go issue, similar to what happens in macOS (see #49352).
    
    Work around this condition by adding a brief sleep before the read.
    
    Fixes #73140.
