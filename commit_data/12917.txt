    syscall: cleanly exit all Go procs on Plan 9
    
    syscall.Exit would originally kill only the calling
    Go proc, leaving behind other procs in the
    same group. This change makes syscall.Exit call
    runtimeÂ·exit, which due to CL
    https://golang.org/cl/5617048
    will cleanly exit all the Go procs in the group.
