    [dev.cc] cmd/8g: work around "out of fixed registers" on Plan 9
    
    This change works around the "out of fixed registers"
    issue with the Plan 9 C compiler on 386, introduced by
    the Bits change to uint64 in CL 169060043.
    
    The purpose of this CL is to be able to properly
    follow the conversion of the Plan 9 runtime to Go
    on the Plan 9 builders.
    
    This CL could be reverted once the Go compilers will
    be converted to Go.
    
    Thanks to Nick Owens for investigating this issue.
