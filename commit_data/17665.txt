+<p>
+In prior releases, a goroutine that was looping forever could starve out other
+goroutines on the same thread, a serious problem when GOMAXPROCS
+provided only one user thread.
+In Go1.2, this is partially addressed: The scheduler is invoked occasionally
+upon entry to a function.
+This means that any loop that includes a (non-inlined) function call can
+be pre-empted, allowing other goroutines to run on the same thread.

+<p>
+The <a href="/cmd/cgo/"><code>cgo</code></a> command will now invoke the C++
+compiler to build any pieces of the linked-to library that are written in C++; the
+documentation has more detail.
