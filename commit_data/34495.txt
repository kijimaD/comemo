    runtime: use -buildmode=pie in testCgoPprofPIE  instead of -extldflags=-pie
    
    Errors occur in runtime test testCgoPprofPIE when the test
    is built by passing -pie to the external linker with code
    that was not built as PIC. This occurs on ppc64le because
    non-PIC is the default, and fails only on newer distros
    where the address range used for programs is high enough
    to cause relocation overflow. This test should be built
    with -buildmode=pie since that correctly generates PIC
    with -pie.
    
    Related issues are #21954 and #22126.
    
    Updates #22459
