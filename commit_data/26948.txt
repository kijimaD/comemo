    cmd/compile: small cleanup to syslook calls
    
    Passing copy==1 to syslook is only necessary to support subsequent
    calls to substArgTypes.  typ2Itab and concatstring* don't have "any"
    parameters, so no point in deep copying their function signatures at
    every call site.
    
    For a couple other syslook calls (makemap and conv[IET]2[IET]), move
    them closer to their corresponding substArgTypes calls so it's easier
    to see that all syslook(fn, 1) calls are necessary.
