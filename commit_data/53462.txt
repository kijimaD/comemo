    doc/go1.21: move Ports to end
    
    The most important parts of almost any release notes are the
    language and tool changes. Those should be the first two sections.
    Instead Ports interrupts the flow with information that usually
    matters only to very few users.
    
    Move Ports to the end of the release notes.
