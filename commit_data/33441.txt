    cmd/dist: read dependencies from source files
    
    I do not remember why we require deps.go to have a hard-coded
    copy of the dependency information for cmd/go, when we can
    read it from the source files instead. The answer probably involves
    cmd/dist once being a C program.
    
    In any event, stop doing that, which will eliminate the builder-only
    failures in the builder-only deps test.
