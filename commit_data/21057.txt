    test: migrate remaining tests to run.go
    
    * bug248, bug345, bug369, and bug429 were ported from bash commands to run scripts. bug369 remains disabled.
    * bug395 is a test for issue 1909, which is still open. It is marked as skip now and will be usable with compile with run.go when issue 1909 is fixed.
    
    Fixes #4139
    
    Updates #1909
