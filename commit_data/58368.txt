    runtime: make special offset a uintptr
    
    Currently specials try to save on space by only encoding the offset from
    the base of the span in a uint16. This worked fine up until Go 1.24.
    - Most specials have an offset of 0 (mem profile, finalizers, etc.)
    - Cleanups do not care about the offset at all, so even if it's wrong,
      it's OK.
    - Weak pointers *do* care, but the unique package always makes a new
      allocation, so the weak pointer handle offset it makes is always zero.
    
    With Go 1.24 and general weak pointers now available, nothing is
    stopping someone from just creating a weak pointer that is >64 KiB
    offset from the start of an object, and this weak pointer must be
    distinct from others.
    
    Fix this problem by just increasing the size of a special and making the
    offset a uintptr, to capture all possible offsets. Since we're in the
    freeze, this is the safest thing to do. Specials aren't so common that I
    expect a substantial memory increase from this change. In a future
    release (or if there is a problem) we can almost certainly pack the
    special's kind and offset together. There was already a bunch of wasted
    space due to padding, so this would bring us back to the same memory
    footprint before this change.
    
    Also, add tests for equality of basic weak interior pointers. This
    works, but we really should've had tests for it.
    
    Fixes #70739.
