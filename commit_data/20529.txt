    cmd/go: fix bytes and net the right way
    
    Not sure why they used empty.s and all these other
    packages were special cased in cmd/go instead.
    Add them to the list.
    
    This avoids problems with net .s files being compiled
    with gcc in cgo mode and gcc not supporting // comments
    on ARM.
    
    Not a problem with bytes, but be consistent.
    
    The last change fixed the ARM build but broke the Windows build.
    Maybe *this* will make everyone happy. Sigh.
