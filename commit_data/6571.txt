    6l: correct logic for morestack choice
    
    The frame that gets allocated is for both
    the args and the autos.  If together they
    exceed the default frame size, we need to
    tell morestack about both so that it allocates
    a large enough frame.
    
    Sanity check stack pointer in morestack
    to catch similar bugs.
