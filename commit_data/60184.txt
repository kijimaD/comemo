    doc/next: populate TODOs found with relnote todo
    
    This is the first round of TODOs created based on relnote todo output.
    There are many entries that need to be documented, expanded, reworded,
    and this change makes progress on setting that up.
    
    For this cycle, relnote todo implemented a simple heuristic of finding
    CLs that mention accepted proposals (see issue 62376, or comment
    https://go.dev/issue/62376#issuecomment-2101086794 specifically).
    The "Items that don't need to be mentioned in Go 1.23 release notes but
    are picked up by relnote todo." section in todo.md contains an attempt
    at reviewing that list. The large number of items needed to be reviewed
    made it impractical to spend much time on any individual one.
    
    For #65614.
