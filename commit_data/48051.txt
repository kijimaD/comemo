    cmd/link: fix PE section attributes for windows/arm64
    
    The clang-mingw toolchain on windows/arm64 expects
    .text to NOT be listed as containing initialized data and
    .dwarf* to be listed as  containing initialized data.
    Neither is true today, resulting in the go .text and .dwarf*
    not being merged with the system .text and .dwarf*.
    Having multiple .text and .dwarf* sections confuses all
    kinds of tools.
