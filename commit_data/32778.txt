    cmd/compile: remove {Mark,Pop}dcl calls in bimport
    
    These were previously only relevant for recording scoping level so
    that invalid 'fallthrough' statements could be rejected. However,
    that's handled differently since CL 61130 (in particular, there's no
    use of types.Block anymore), so these calls can be safely removed.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
