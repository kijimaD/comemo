commit 36eee6d1e13c4d16c66259ce8da9318dcfda0459
Author: Austin Clements <aclements@csail.mit.edu>

    Make the expression compiler not use the AST visitor.  The
    statement compiler will be fixed in a later CL.
    
    The input and output of the expression compiler are now
    clearly distinguished.  In the process, I made the individual
    expression compilers operate on the compiled form of their
    children instead of AST nodes.  As a result, there are now
    fewer places where I hand-craft intermediate expression nodes.
    
    The diff looks scarier than it is, mostly because exprCompiler
    has been split into the input and output types, resulting in
    lots of little renames.
