    os/signal: increase settle time in tests
    
    I noticed a timeout in TestIgnore in
    https://build.golang.org/log/52d83a72f3a5ea9a16eb5d670c729694144f9624,
    which suggests that the settle time is currently set too low.
    
    I've also added a check for the same GO_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE used in
    TestTerminalSignal, so that if this builder remains too slow we can
    increase the builder's scale factor rather than the test's baseline
    running time.
    
    Updates #33174
