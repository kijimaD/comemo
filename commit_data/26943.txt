    cmd/compile: fix register size for ODOTPTR result
    
    The result of ODOTPTR, as well as a bunch of other ops,
    should be the type of the result, not always a pointer type.
    
    This fixes an amd64p32 bug where we were incorrectly truncating
    a 64-bit slice index to 32 bits, and then barfing on a weird
    load-64-bits-but-then-truncate-to-32-bits op that doesn't exist.
    
    Fixes #15252
