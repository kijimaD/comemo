    misc/cgo/testplugin: set the package name in TestIssue19534
    
    The fix for #19534 (in CL 40994) adjusted escaping in the
    dynamically-linked name lookup logic for the plugin package. However,
    the regression test added for it incorrectly included quotes within
    the -ldflags flag, causing the flag to inadvertently be ignored.
    
    Possibly in that same CL or possibly at some other point, the
    condition that the test thought it was checking stopped working: the
    dynamic lookup used the path passed to ldflags, but the object file
    actually contained the symbol indexed by the original package name.
    
    Ideally we should stop mucking around with ldflags in this test and
    run 'go build' from a suitably-named directory instead, to mimic the
    actual conditions in which the original bug was reported. For now, as
    a more targeted fix, we can pass the '-p' flag to the compiler to
    adjust the package path used at compile time to match the one that
    will be set at link time.
    
    For #43177.
    Updates #19534.
