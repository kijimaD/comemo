    time: don't depend on the io package
    
    The time package has never depended on the io package until
    a recent change during Go 1.7 to use the io.Seek* constants.
    
    The go/build dependency check didn't catch this because "time" was
    allowed to depend on meta package group "L0", which included "io".
    
    Adding the "io" package broke one of Dmitry's tools. The tool is
    fixable, but it's also not necessary for us to depend on "io" at all
    for some constants. Mirror the constants instead, and change
    deps_test.go to prevent an io dependency in the future.
