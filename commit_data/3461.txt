    more comment work.
    got rid of regexps.
    primary bug fix is that // inside /* */ do not get stripped anymore,
    so that the text inside
    
    /*
    int a;
    // int b;
    int c;
    */
    
    is
    
    int a;
    // int b;
    int c;
    
    before, the "int b;" line was being uncommented too.
