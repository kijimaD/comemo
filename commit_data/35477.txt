    misc/android: forward SIGQUIT to the process running on the device
    
    When a test binary runs for too long, the go command sends it a
    SIGQUIT to force a backtrace dump. On Android, the exec wrapper
    will instead receive the signal and dump its backtrace.
    
    Forward SIGQUIT signals from the wrapper to the wrapped process
    to gain useful backtraces.
    
    Inspired by issuse 25519; this CL would have revealed the hanging
    test directly in the builder log.
