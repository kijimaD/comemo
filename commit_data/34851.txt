    cmd/link: use . as DW_AT_comp_dir
    
    Go's DWARF usually has absolute paths, in which case DW_AT_comp_dir
    doesn't matter. But the -trimpath flag produces relative paths, and
    then the spec says that they are relative to _comp_dir.
    
    There's no way to know what the "right" value of _comp_dir is without
    more user input, but we can at least leave the paths alone rather than
    making them absolute.
    
    After this change, Delve can find sources to a program built with
    -gcflags=-trimpath=$(pwd) as long as it's run in the right directory.
