    testing: explain using a _test package
    
    The existing documentation did not explain the difference between
    placing a _test.go file in the same package as what is being
    tested vs. adding it to a separate _test package. This explains the
    distinction and adds an example.
    
    Concept is explained well here:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/31443271
    
    Fixes #25223
