    net: skip socket hungry test on iOS
    
    The iOS builder recently gained access to the GO_BUILDER_NAME
    environment variable, which in turn enabled some net tests that
    were previously guarded by testenv.Builder() == "". Some such tests
    have been disabled because they don't work; others have increased
    the pressure on open file descriptors, pushing the low iOS limit of
    250.
    
    Since many net tests run with t.Parallel(), the "too many open files"
    error hit many different tests, so instead of playing whack-a-mole,
    lower the file descriptor demand by skipping the most file
    descriptor hungry test, TestTCPSpuriousConnSetupCompletionWithCancel.
    
    Before:
    
    $ GO_BUILDER_NAME=darwin-arm64 GOARCH=arm64 go test -short -v net
    ...
    Socket statistical information:
    ...
    (inet4, stream, default): opened=5245 connected=193 listened=75 accepted=177 closed=5399 openfailed=0 connectfailed=5161 listenfailed=0 acceptfailed=143 closefailed=0
    ...
    
    After:
    
    $ GO_BUILDER_NAME=darwin-arm64 GOARCH=arm64 go test -short -v net
    ...
    Socket statistical information:
    ...
    (inet4, stream, default): opened=381 connected=194 listened=75 accepted=169 closed=547 openfailed=0 connectfailed=297 listenfailed=0 acceptfailed=134 closefailed=0
    ...
    
    Fixes #25365 (Hopefully).
