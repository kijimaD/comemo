    cmd/compile: preserve/translate names for parameters
    
    This is part of getting debugging into good shape
    with the register ABI.  (This may generate a backport
    for 1.16, there was some regression there as well.)
    
    This is not necessarily fully-baked yet; my goal is to
    make it work "well enough" for actual debugging, then
    revisit the metrics, which are currently ignorant
    of registers used for passing parameters (currently,
    rejects them as a valid option).
    
    Updates #40724.
