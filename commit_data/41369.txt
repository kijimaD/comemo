    net/http, doc/go1.13.html: revert TimeoutHandler.Flush
    
    Also added a test to ensure that any interactions
    between TimeoutHandler and Flusher result in the
    correct status code and body, but also that we don't
    get superfluous logs from stray writes as was seen
    in the bug report.
    
    Fixes #34439.
