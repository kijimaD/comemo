    cmd/link/internal/loadpe: refactor readpesym()
    
    Rewrite the helper "readpesym()" and the code that calls it to pass in
    most of the values it needs via a state object (the signature was
    getting a bit too busy/lengthy). No change in functionality, this is
    just a refactor.
    
    Updates #35006.
