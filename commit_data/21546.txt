    net: permit WriteMsgUDP to connected UDP sockets
    
    The sanity checks at the beginning of WriteMsgUDP were too
    strict, and did not allow a case sendmsg(2) suppports: sending
    to a connected UDP socket.
    
    This fixes the sanity checks. Either the socket is unconnected,
    and a destination addresses is required (what all existing callers
    must have been doing), or the socket is connected and an explicit
    destination address must not be used.
    
    Fixes #9807
