    runtime: define netpollinited on Plan 9
    
    Since CL 2750, the build is broken on Plan 9,
    because a new function netpollinited was added
    and called from findrunnable in proc1.go.
    However, netpoll is not implemented on Plan 9.
    Thus, we define netpollinited in netpoll_stub.go.
    
    Fixes #9590
