    runtime: fix sigset type for ppc64 big-endian GNU/Linux
    
    On 64-bit big-endian GNU/Linux machines we need to treat sigset as a
    single uint64, not as a pair of uint32 values. This fix was already made
    for s390x, but not for ppc64 (which is big-endian--the little endian
    version is known as ppc64le). So copy os_linux_390.x to
    os_linux_be64.go, and use build constraints as needed.
    
    Fixes #17361
