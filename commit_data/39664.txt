    spec: document new Go2 number literals
    
    This CL documents the new binary and octal integer literals,
    hexadecimal floats, generalized imaginary literals and digit
    separators for all number literals in the spec.
    
    Added empty lines between abutting paragraphs in some places
    (a more thorough cleanup can be done in a separate CL).
    
    A minor detail: A single 0 was considered an octal zero per the
    syntax (decimal integer literals always started with a non-zero
    digit). The new octal literal syntax allows 0o and 0O prefixes
    and when keeping the respective octal_lit syntax symmetric with
    all the others (binary_lit, hex_lit), a single 0 is not automatically
    part of it anymore. Rather than complicating the new octal_lit syntax
    to include 0 as before, it is simpler (and more natural) to accept
    a single 0 as part of a decimal_lit. This is purely a notational
    change.
