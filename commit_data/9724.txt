    exp/ssh: new package.
    
    The typical UNIX method for controlling long running process is to
    send the process signals. Since this doesn't get you very far, various
    ad-hoc, remote-control protocols have been used over time by programs
    like Apache and BIND.
    
    Implementing an SSH server means that Go code will have a standard,
    secure way to do this in the future.
