    runtime/pprof: mark TestCPUProfileMultithreadMagnitude as flaky
    
    The Linux kernel starting in 5.9 and fixed in 5.16 has a bug that can
    break CPU timer signal delivery on new new threads if the timer
    interrupt fires during handling of the clone system call.
    
    Broken CPU timer signal deliver will skew CPU profile results and cause
    this test to fail.
    
    There is currently no known workaround, so mark the test as flaky on
    builders with known broken kernels.
    
    For #49065
