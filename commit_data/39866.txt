    cmd/go/internal/get: make the implementation of charsetReader match its comment
    
    The doc comment for charsetReader claims that it supports UTF-8,
    but in practice it does not: instead, it is never invoked for UTF-8.
    
    We could update the comment to clarify that fact, but it seems simpler
    to change the implementation to match the comment.
