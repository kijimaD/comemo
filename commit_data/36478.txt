    cmd/compile: unify compilation of compiler tests
    
    Before this CL we would build&run each test file individually.
    Building the test takes most of the time, a significant fraction of a
    second. Running the tests are really fast.
    
    After this CL, we build all the tests at once, then run each
    individually. We only have to run the compiler&linker once (or twice,
    for softfloat architectures) instead of once per test.
    
    While we're here, organize these tests to fit a bit more into the
    standard testing framework.
    
    This is just the organizational CL that changes the testing framework
    and migrates 2 tests.  Future tests will follow.

    Update #26469
