    runtime: fix sanity check in stackBarrier
    
    stackBarrier on amd64 sanity checks that it's unwinding the correct
    entry in the stack barrier array. However, this check is wrong in two
    ways that make it unlikely to catch anything, right or wrong:
    
    1) It checks that savedLRPtr == SP, but, in fact, it should be that
       savedLRPtr+8 == SP because the RET that returned to stackBarrier
       popped the saved LR. However, we didn't notice this check was wrong
       because,
    
    2) the sense of the conditional branch is also wrong.
    
    Fix both of these.
