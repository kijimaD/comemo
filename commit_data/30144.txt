    runtime: debug code to panic when marking a free object
    
    This adds debug code enabled in gccheckmark mode that panics if we
    attempt to mark an unallocated object. This is a common issue with the
    hybrid barrier when we're manipulating uninitialized memory that
    contains stale pointers. This also tends to catch bugs that will lead
    to "sweep increased allocation count" crashes closer to the source of
    the bug.
