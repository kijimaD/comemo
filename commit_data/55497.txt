    runtime: Allow handling of EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR
    
    Currently, access faults on memory mapped files on Windows (e.g.
    from the drive the memory mapped file is on being ejected) cause
    a runtime fault that can not be caught by debug.SetPanicOnFault.
    
    On Unix systems, on the other hand, this causes a SIGBUS signal,
    which can be caught by debug.SetPanicOnFault. Given that the
    documentation of debug.SetPanicOnFault mentions handling memory
    mapped files, this is arguably the correct behaviour.
    
    Add handling, analogous to SIGBUS, to EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR
    on Windows, to allow for users to handle this error.
    
    Fixes #58457
