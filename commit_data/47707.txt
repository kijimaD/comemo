    src/cmd/go/internal/work: lock Builder output mutex consistently
    
    To prevent interleaving of output when 'go build' compiles several
    packages in parallel, the output mutex in the Builder struct must
    be locked around any calls to Builder.Print which could generate
    arbitrary amounts of text (ie more than is guaranteed to be written
    atomically to a pipe).
    
    Fixes #49987
    For #49338
