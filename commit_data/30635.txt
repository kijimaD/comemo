    cmd/cgo: ignore top-level qualifiers in function args/results
    
    The top-level qualifiers are unimportant for our purposes. If a C
    function is defined as `const int f(const int i)`, the `const`s are
    meaningless to C, and we want to avoid using them in the struct we
    create where the `const` has a completely different meaning.
    
    This unwinds https://golang.org/cl/33097 with regard to top-level
    qualifiers.
