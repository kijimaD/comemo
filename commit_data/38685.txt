    runtime: use iterator instead of raw node for treap find
    
    Right now the mTreap structure exposes the treapNode structure through
    only one interface: find. There's no reason (performance or otherwise)
    for exposing this, and we get a cleaner abstraction through the
    iterators this way. This change also makes it easier to make changes to
    the mTreap implementation without violating its interface.
