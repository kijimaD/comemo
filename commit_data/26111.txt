    cmd/vet: remove -test flag
    
    -test flag is a testing only flag that enables all vet checks. It was needed
    because there was no way to run all vet checks in a single command
    invocation. However it is possible to do this now by combining -all and -shadow
    flags.
    
    Also a recently added -tests flag is similarly named, having both -test and
    -tests can be confusing.
