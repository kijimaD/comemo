    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: use MOVDU to update stack reg for leaf functions where possible
    
    When the stack register is decremented to acquire stack space at
    the beginning of a function, a MOVDU should be used so it is done
    atomically, unless the size of the stack frame is too large for
    that instruction.  The code to determine whether to use MOVDU
    or MOVD was checking if the function was a leaf and always generating MOVD
    when it was.  The choice of MOVD vs. MOVDU should only depend on the stack
    frame size.  This fixes that problem.
