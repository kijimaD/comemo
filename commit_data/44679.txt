    path,path/filepath: add Join examples with ".." components
    
    People sometimes expect Join to trim .. components from its arguments
    before joining, and are surprised that it doesn't. This is bad if they
    were relying on that assumed behaviour to prevent directory traversal
    attacks.
    
    While a careful reading of the documentation for Join and Clean
    might dispel this notion, it is not obvious at first glance.
    
    Add a case to the examples to nudge people in the right direction.
    
    Updates #40373
