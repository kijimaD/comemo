    cmd/go: retry RemoveAll(workdir) for up to 500ms
    
    On some configurations of Windows, directories containing executable
    files may be locked for a while after the executable exits (perhaps
    due to antivirus scans?). It's probably worth a little extra latency
    on exit to avoid filling up the user's temporary directory with leaked
    files.
