    cmd/compile: fix crash with -race on large expr containing string->[]byte conversion
    
    The assumption is that there are no nested function calls in complex expressions.
    For the most part that assumption is true. It wasn't for these calls inserted during walk.
    Fix that.
    
    I looked through all the calls to mkcall in walk and these were the only cases
    that emitted calls, that could be part of larger expressions (like not delete),
    and that were not already handled.
    
    Fixes #12225.
