    net/http/pprof: make TestDeltaProfile less flaky by retrying
    
    In some slow environment, the goroutine for mutexHog2 may not run
    within 1secs. So, try with increasing seconds parameters,
    and declare failure if it still fails with the longest duration
    parameter (32sec).
    
    Also, relax the test condition - previously we expected the
    profile's duration is within 0.5~2sec. But obviously, in some
    slow environment, that's not even guaranteed. Just check we get
    non-zero duration in the result.
    
    Update #38544
