    runtime: revert "traceback: include pc=0x%x for inline frames"
    
    This reverts commit 643d816c8b43 (CL 561635).
    
    Reason for revert: This works for telemetry but broke various other
    properties of the tracebacks as well as some programs that read
    tracebacks. We should figure out a solution that works for all uses,
    and in the interim we should not be making telemetry work at the
    cost of breaking other, existing valid uses.
    
    See #65761 for details.
