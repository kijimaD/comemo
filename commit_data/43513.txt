    runtime: remove memstats.heap_idle
    
    This statistic is updated in many places but for MemStats may be
    computed from existing statistics. Specifically by definition
    heap_idle = heap_sys - heap_inuse since heap_sys is all memory allocated
    from the OS for use in the heap minus memory used for non-heap purposes.
    heap_idle is almost the same (since it explicitly includes memory that
    *could* be used for non-heap purposes) but also doesn't include memory
    that's actually used to hold heap objects.
    
    Although it has some utility as a sanity check, it complicates
    accounting and we want fewer, orthogonal statistics for upcoming metrics
    changes, so just drop it.
