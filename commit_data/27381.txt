    runtime/cgo: block signals to the iOS mach exception handler
    
    For darwin/arm{,64} a non-Go thread is created to convert
    EXC_BAD_ACCESS to panics. However, the Go signal handler refuse to
    handle signals that would otherwise be ignored if they arrive at
    non-Go threads.
    
    Block all (posix) signals to that thread, making sure that
    no unexpected signals arrive to it. At least one test, TestStop in
    os/signal, depends on signals not arriving on any non-Go threads.
    
    For #14318
