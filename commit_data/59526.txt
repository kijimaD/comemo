    sync: set GOMAXPROCS to 1 in TestPoolGC
    
    This test expects to be able to drain a Pool using only Get. This isn't
    actually possible in the general case, since a pooled value could get
    stuck in some P's private slot. However, if GOMAXPROCS=1, there's only 1
    P we could be running on, so getting stuck becomes impossible.
    
    This test isn't checking any concurrent properties of Pool, so this is
    fine. Just set GOMAXPROCS=1 for this one particular test.
    
    Fixes #73728.
