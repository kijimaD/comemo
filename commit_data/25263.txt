    runtime, os/signal: use //go:linkname instead of assembly stubs to get access to runtime functions
    
    os/signal depends on a few unexported runtime functions. This removes the
    assembly stubs it used to get access to these in favour of using
    //go:linkname in runtime to make the functions accessible to os/signal.
    
    This is motivated by ppc64le shared libraries, where you cannot BR to a symbol
    defined in a shared library (only BL), but it seems like an improvment anyway.
