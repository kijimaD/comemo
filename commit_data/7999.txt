commit 5ee13c0d59de2f26dacc53046ce265232eeb6f2b
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 6 11:48:03 2011 -0700

    log: generalize getting and setting flags and prefix.
    - used to be only for standard log, not for user-built.
    - there were no getters.
    Also rearrange the code a little so we can avoid allocating
    a buffer on every call.  Logging is expensive but we should
    avoid unnecessary cost.
    
    This should have no effect on existing code.
