    os: don't return Chmod's error from Mkdir and OpenFile
    
    Mkdir and OpenFile call Chmod internally on *BSD and Solaris,
    because these OSes don't handle the sticky bit correctly.
    
    However Chmod's error should be ignored. It shouldn't hide
    the fact that a file itself is created.
    
    Fixes #8383
