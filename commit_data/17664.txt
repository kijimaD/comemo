    test/chan: avoid wrap-around in memstats comparison
    
    The select2.go test assumed that the memory allocated between
    its two samplings of runtime.ReadMemStats is strictly
    increasing.  To avoid failing the tests when this is not true,
    a greater-than check is introduced before computing the
    difference in allocated memory.
