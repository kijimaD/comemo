commit 8684a089896bffb5ed0818bc39d7ab7c2cf0e2fe
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    strings: add Title
    strings.ToTitle converts all characters to title case, which for consistency with the
    other To* functions it should continue to do.  This CL adds string.Title, which
    does a proper title-casing of the string.
    A similar function for package bytes will follow once this is settled.
    Fixes #933.
