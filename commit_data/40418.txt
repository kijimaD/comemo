    test: use a real use function in nilptr2.go
    
    Adjust the dummy use function to a real use. As suggested by the
    println calls in the test, nilptr2.go supposes to check that a
    used nil pointer dereference panics. This use function is not
    real enough so an optimized compiler such as gccgo could
    eliminate the call.
    
    The spec requires that even a dummy use would cause a panic.
    Unfortunately, due to #31151 this is not true for gccgo at -O1 or
    above.
