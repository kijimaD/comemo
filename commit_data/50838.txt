    net/http: do not cancel request context on response body read
    
    When sending a Request with a non-context deadline, we create a
    context with a timeout. This context is canceled when closing the
    response body, and also if a read from the response body returns
    an error (including io.EOF).
    
    Cancelling the context in Response.Body.Read interferes with the
    HTTP/2 client cleaning up after a request is completed, and is
    unnecessary: The user should always close the body, the impact
    from not canceling the context is minor (the context timer leaks
    until it fires).
    
    Fixes #49366.
