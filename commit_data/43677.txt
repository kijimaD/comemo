    syscall: switch go:generate directives back to mksyscall_windows.go
    
    Adjust mksyscall_windows.go to activate module mode and set
    -mod=readonly, and to suppress its own deprecation warning when run
    from within GOROOT/src.
    
    We can't vendor the mkwinsyscall tool in to the std module directly,
    because std-vendored dependencies (unlike the dependencies of all
    other modules) turn into actual, distinct packages in 'std' when
    viewed from outside the 'std' module. We don't want to introduce a
    binary in the 'std' meta-pattern, but we also don't particularly want
    to add more special-cases to the 'go' command right now when we have
    an existing wrapper program that can do the job.
    
    I also regenerated the affected packages to ensure that they are
    consistent with the current version of mksyscall, which produced some
    declaration-order changes in
    internal/syscall/windows/zsyscall_windows.go.
    
    Fixes #41916
    Updates #25922
