    goinstall: process dependencies for package main
    
    Currently to install a command, you have to manually
    goinstall each of the remote packages that it depends on.
    This patch lets goinstall P work where P is
    contains files in package main.
    It does not actually build the package, but
    it installs all of its dependencies and prints a message
    to that effect.
