    go/types: correctly determine if panic call refers to built-in
    
    R=go1.11
    
    The terminating statement check for functions that declare result
    parameters was using the wrong scope to look up calls to `panic`
    which in esoteric cases lead to a false positive.
    
    Instead of looking up a panic call again at a time when correct
    scope information would have to be recomputed, collect calls to
    predeclared panic in a set when type-checking that call.
    
    Fixes #23218.
