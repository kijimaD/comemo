    cmd/api: don't depend on os/user or USER to check api
    
    The -nocgo builder failed because it has cgo disabled
    as well as no USER environment variable:

    # Checking API compatibility.
    Error getting current user: user: Current not implemented on linux/amd64
    exit status 1
    
    Don't require the environment variable here.
