    syscall, net: make deadline changes affect blocked read/write calls on nacl
    
    Flesh out nacl's fake network system to match how all the other
    platforms work: all other systems' SetReadDeadline and
    SetWriteDeadline affect currently-blocked read & write calls.
    This was documented in golang.org/cl/30164 because it was the status
    quo and existing packages relied on it. (notably the net/http package)
    
    And add a test.
