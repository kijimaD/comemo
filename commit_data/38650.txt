    cmd/compile: fix race on initializing Sym symFunc flag
    
    SSA lowering can create PFUNC ONAME nodes when compiling method calls.
    Since we generally initialize the node's Sym to a func when we set its
    class to PFUNC, we did this here, too. Unfortunately, since SSA
    compilation is concurrent, this can cause a race if two function
    compilations try to initialize the same symbol.
    
    Luckily, we don't need to do this at all, since we're actually just
    wrapping an ONAME node around an existing Sym that's already marked as
    a function symbol.
    
    Fixes the linux-amd64-racecompile builder, which was broken by CL
    147158.
    
    Updates #27539.
