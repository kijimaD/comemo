    encoding/base32: ensure base32 decoder propagates errors correctly
    
    A number of issues in decoder.Read and newlineFilteringReader.Read were
    preventing errors from the reader supplying the encoded data from being
    propagated to the caller.  Fixing these issues revealed some additional
    problems in which valid decoded data was not always returned to the user
    when errors were actually propagated.
    
    This commit fixes both the error propagation and the lost decoded data
    problems.  It also adds some new unit tests to ensure errors are handled
    correctly by decoder.Read.  The new unit tests increase the test coverage
    of this package from 96.2% to 97.9%.
    
    Fixes #20044
