    cmd/compile/internal/escape: use an ir.ReassignOracle
    
    Using the new-ish ir.ReassignOracle is more efficient than calling
    ir.StaticValue repeatedly.
    
    This CL now uses an ir.ReassignOracle for the recent
    make constant propagation introduced in CL 649035.
    
    We also pull the main change from CL 649035 into a new function,
    which we will update later in our stack. We will also use the
    ReassignOracles introduced here later in our stack.
    
    (We originally did most of this work in CL 649077, but we abandoned
    that in favor of CL 649035).
    
    We could also use an ir.ReassignOracle in the older processing of
    ir.OCALLFUNC in (*escape).call, but for now, we just leave that
    as a TODO.
    
    Updates #71359
