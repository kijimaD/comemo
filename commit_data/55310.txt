    cmd/compile: apply FixVariadicCall and FixMethodCall during typecheck
    
    To simplify backend analysis, we normalize variadic and method calls:
    variadic calls are rewritten with an explicit slice argument, and
    method calls are turned into function calls that pass the receiver
    argument as the first parameter.
    
    But because we've been supporting multiple frontends, this
    normalization was scattered in various later passes. Now that we're
    back to just one frontend, we can move the normalization forward into
    typecheck (where most other IR normalization already happens).
