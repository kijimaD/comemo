    net: make two tests not parallel
    
    Running
    
    stress -p 1 go test -short std
    
    on a heavily loaded machine causes net timeouts
    every 15 or 20 runs.
    Making these tests not run in parallel helps.
    With this change, I havenâ€™t seen a single failure
    in over 100 runs.
    
    Fixes #14986
