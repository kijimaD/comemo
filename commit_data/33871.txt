    misc/cgo/errors: fix erroneous regexp detection
    
    I had passed 1 instead of 2 to the SplitAfterN call in
    errorstest.check, so all of the cases were erroneously falling through
    to the non-regexp case (and passing even if the actual error didn't
    match).
    
    Now, we use bytes.HasSuffix to check for the non-regexp case, so we
    will not incorrectly match a regexp comment to the non-regexp case.
    
    updates #13467
