    gotest: make it easier to get the help string
    Because gotest's args are mingled with the tests, it's
    hard to get the usage message to print. This CL adds
    explicit support for -help, spelled several different ways.
    Gotest has special flags like -file that are somewhat
    hidden otherwise.
