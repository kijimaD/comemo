    io: clarify documentation for Seeker
    
    The later part of the docstring simply talks about "offset" but does
    not disambiguate what it is relative to. For both the return value
    and valid offsets to seek to, it only makes sense in the context of
    "offset relative to origin of file".
    
    Fixes #11877
