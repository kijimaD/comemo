    cmd/gc, runtime: optimize map[string] lookup from []byte key
    
    Brad has been asking for this for a while.
    I have resisted because I wanted to find a more general way to
    do this, one that would keep the performance of code introducing
    variables the same as the performance of code that did not.
    (See golang.org/issue/3512#c20).
    
    I have not found the more general way, and recent changes to
    remove ambiguously live temporaries have blown away the
    property I was trying to preserve, so that's no longer a reason
    not to make the change.
    
    Fixes #3512.
