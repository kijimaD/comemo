    [dev.link] cmd/link: fix some bugs in loader
    
    This patch fixes a couple of bugs introduced in CL 210778 and CL 207606:
    
    - apply the same version selection scheme in loader.CreateExtSym that
      we're currently using for loader.Create (since the two functions
      will be used in the same way by the host object loader)
    
    - add code to the loader's NewLoader function to create initial map
      values for some of the map-based symbol attributes (somewhere along
      the line the code to do this seems to have gotten lost, so this
      patch adds it back).
    
    - fix a coding error in growAttrBitmaps (wrong bitmap passed to
      append when extending attrOnList)
