    container/heap: fix circular dependency in test
    
    Having the test be in the container/heap package yields a cycle
      container/heap (for the test)
      -> testing
      -> time
      -> container/heap (for timerHeap)
    
    Occasionally the linker would get mixed up, resulting in a test panic
    in a very weird place.
