    runtime/cgo: rename crosscall_386 to crosscall1 and standardise API
    
    Most architectures have a crosscall1 function that takes a function
    pointer, a setg_gcc function pointer and a g pointer. However,
    crosscall_386 only takes a function pointer and the call to setg_gcc
    is performed in the thread entry function.
    
    Rename crosscall_386 to crosscall1 for consistency with other
    architectures, as well as standardising the API - while not strictly
    necessary, it will allow for further deduplication as the calling
    code becomes more consistent.
