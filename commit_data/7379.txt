    crypto/tls: load a chain of certificates from a file.
    
    Many recently issued certificates are chained: there's one or more
    intermediate certificates between the host certificate and the root CA
    certificate. This change causes the code to load any number of
    certificates from the certificate file. This matches the behaviour of
    common webservers, and the output of OpenSSL's command line tools.
