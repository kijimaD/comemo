    cmd/compile/internal/types2: mark gotypesalias as undocumented
    
    CL 541737 added gotypesalias to control whether Alias types are used.
    This setting is meant to use by end users through go/types. However,
    types2 also uses it, but it's an internal package, causing bootstrap
    failed because of unknown setting.
    
    Marking the setting as undocumented in types2 fixes the problem.
    
    Fixes #64106
