    runtime: merge codepaths in scavengeLargest
    
    This change just makes the code in scavengeLargest easier to reason
    about by reducing the number of exit points to the method. It should
    still be correct either way because the condition checked at the end
    (released > nbytes) will always be false if we return, but this just
    makes the code a little easier to maintain.
