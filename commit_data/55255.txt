    cmd/compile: flag 'large' functions when -m=2+ in effect
    
    When -m=N (where N > 1) is in effect, include a note in the trace
    output if a given function is considered "big" during inlining
    analysis, since this causes the inliner to be less aggressive. If a
    small change to a large function happens to nudge it over the large
    function threshold, it can be confusing for developers, thus it's
    probably worth including this info in the remark output.
