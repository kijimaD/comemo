    runtime: prevent racefini from being invoked more than once
    
    racefini calls __tsan_fini which is C code and at the end of it
    invoked the standard C library exit(3) call. This has undefined
    behavior if invoked more than once. Specifically in C++ programs
    it caused static destructors to run twice. At least on glibc
    impls it also means the at_exit handlers list (where those are
    stored) also free's a list entry when it completes these. So invoking
    twice results in a double free at exit which trips debug memory
    allocation tracking.
    
    Fix all of this by using an atomic as a boolean barrier around
    calls to racefini being invoked > 1 time.
    
    Fixes #15578
