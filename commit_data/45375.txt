    cmd/go: use a real Go version in the go.mod files in TestScript/mod_readonly
    
    For some reason, the go.mod file added to this test in CL 147281 lists
    'go 1.20' instead of the version that was actually current when the
    go.mod file was added.
    
    That causes the test's behavior to change under lazy loading, because
    1.20 is above the threshold to trigger lazy-loading invariants (1.17).
    
    For #36460
