    cmd/internal/gc, cmd/internal/obj: clean up string returns
    
    An artifact of the c2go translation was
    a handful of instances of code like:
    
    var s string
    s += "foo"
    return s
    
    This CL converts those to simply 'return "foo"'.
    
    The conversion was done mechanically with the
    quick-and-dirty cleanup script at
    https://gist.github.com/josharian/1fa4408044c163983e62.
    
    I then manually moved a couple of comments in fmt.go.
    
    toolstash -cmp thinks that there are no functional changes.
