    cmd/compile: enable flag-specified dump of specific phase+function
    
    For very large input files, use of GOSSAFUNC to obtain a dump
    after compilation steps can lead to both unwieldy large output
    files and unwieldy larger processes (because the output is
    buffered in a string).  This flag
    
      -d=ssa/<phase>/dump:<function name>
    
    provides finer control of what is dumped, into a smaller
    file, and with less memory overhead in the running compiler.
    The special phase name "build" is added to allow printing
    of the just-built ssa before any transformations are applied.
    
    This was helpful in making sense of the gogo/protobuf
    problems.
    
    The output format was tweaked to remove gratuitous spaces,
    and a crude -d=ssa/help help text was added.
