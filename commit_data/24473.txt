    runtime/cgo: fix darwin/amd64 signal handling setup
    
    Was not allocating space for the frame above sigpanic,
    nor was it pushing the LR into the right place.
    Because traceback past sigpanic only needs the
    LR for faulting leaves, this was not noticed too much.
    But it did break the sync/atomic nil deref tests.
