    cmd/go: send timed out test SIGQUIT before SIGKILL
    
    There is a chance that the SIGQUIT will make the test process
    dump its stacks as part of exiting, which would be nice for
    finding out what it is doing.
    
    Right now the builders are occasionally timing out running
    the runtime test. I hope this will give us some information
    about the state of the runtime.
