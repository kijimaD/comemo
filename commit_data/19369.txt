    sync/atomic: fix unimportant assembly errors found by go vet
    
    None of these are real bugs.
    The variable name in the reference is not semantically meaningful,
    except that 'go vet' will double check the offset against the name for you.
    
    The stack sizes being corrected really are incorrect but they are also
    in NOSPLIT functions so they typically don't matter.
    
    Found by vet.
