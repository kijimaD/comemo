    math/big: new mini-compiler for arith assembly
    
    The arith assembly is big enough, and the details that you have to keep
    in mind are complex enough and varied enough, that it is worth using
    a Go program to generate the assembly. That way, all the architectures
    can use the same algorithms, and porting to new architectures will be
    easier.
    
    This is the first of a sequence of CLs to introduce a new mini-compiler
    for generating the arith assembly, in math/big/internal/asmgen.
    This CL has the basics of the compiler as well as a couple simple
    architectures and the generator for addVV/subVV. It does not check
    in the generated assembly yet. That will happen in a followup CL after
    the other architectures and generators have been added.
