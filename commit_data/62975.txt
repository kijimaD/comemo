    crypto/tls: fix TLS <1.3 client cert required alert
    
    Previously for protocol versions older than TLS 1.3 our server handshake
    implementation sent an alertBadCertificate alert in the case where the
    server TLS config indicates a client cert is required and none was
    received.
    
    This commit updates the relevant logic to instead send
    alertHandshakeFailure in these circumstances.
    
    For TLS 1.2, RFC 5246 ยง7.4.6 unambiguously describes this as the correct
    alert:
      If the client does not send any certificates, the
      server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake without
      client authentication, or respond with a fatal handshake_failure
      alert.
    
    The TLS 1.1 and 1.0 specs also describe using this alert (RFC 4346 ยง7.4.6
    and RFC 2246 ยง7.4.6) both say:
      If client authentication is required by the server for the handshake
      to continue, it may respond with a fatal handshake failure alert.
    
    Making this correction also allows enabling the
    RequireAnyClientCertificate-TLS1* bogo tests.
