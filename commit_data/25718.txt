    Dmitry says in email about this:
    
    > The stack trace points to it pretty clearly. Done can indeed unblock
    > Wait first and then panic. I guess we need to recover after first
    > Done as well.
    
    And it looks like TestWaitGroupMisuse2 was already hardened against
    this.  Do the same in TestWaitGroupMisuse3.
