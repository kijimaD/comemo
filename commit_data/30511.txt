    net/http/httptest: add Client and Certificate methods to Server
    
    Adds a function for easily accessing the x509.Certificate
    of a Server, if there is one. Also adds a helper function
    for getting a http.Client suitable for use with the server.
    
    This makes the steps required to test a httptest
    TLS server simpler.
    
    Fixes #18411
