    encoding/json: speed up tokenization of literals
    
    Decoder.Decode and Unmarshal actually scan the input bytes twice - the
    first time to check for syntax errors and the length of the value, and
    the second to perform the decoding.
    
    It's in the second scan that we actually tokenize the bytes. Since
    syntax errors aren't a possibility, we can take shortcuts.
    
    In particular, literals such as quoted strings are very common in JSON,
    so we can avoid a lot of work by special casing them.
