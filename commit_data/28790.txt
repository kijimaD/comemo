    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: 386 port now works
    
    GOARCH=386 SSATEST=1 ./all.bash passes
    
    Caveat: still needs changes to test/ files to use *_ssa.go versions.  I
    won't check those changes in with this CL because the builders will
    complain as they don't have SSATEST=1.
    
    Mostly minor fixes.
    
    Implement float <-> uint32 in assembly.  It seems the simplest option
    for now.
    
    GO386=387 does not work.  That's why I can't make SSA the default for
    386 yet.
