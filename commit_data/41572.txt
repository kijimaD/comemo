    runtime: use staticuint64s instead of staticbytes for 1-length strings
    
    This was the last remaining use of staticbytes, so we can now
    delete it.
    
    The new code appears slightly faster on amd64:
    
    name                   old time/op  new time/op  delta
    SliceByteToString/1-4  6.29ns ± 2%  5.89ns ± 1%  -6.46%  (p=0.000 n=14+14)
    
    This may not be the case on the big-endian architectures, since they have
    to do an extra addition.
