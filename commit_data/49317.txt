    misc/cgo/testsanitizers: use buffered channel in tsan12.go
    
    os/signal.Notify requires that "the caller must ensure that c has
    sufficient buffer space to keep up with the expected signal rate"
    as it does a nonblocking send when it receives a signal. The test
    currently using a unbuffered channel, which means it may miss the
    signal if the signal arrives before the channel receive operation.
    
    Fixes #52998.
