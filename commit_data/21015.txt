    [dev.power64] gc: fix etype of strings
    
    The etype of references to strings was being incorrectly set
    to TINT32 on all platforms.  Change it to TSTRING.  It seems
    this doesn't matter for compilation, since x86 uses LEA
    instructions to load string addresses and arm and power64
    disassemble the string into its constituent pieces (with the
    correct types), but it helps when debugging.
