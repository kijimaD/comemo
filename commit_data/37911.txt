    net/url, net/http: reject control characters in URLs
    
    This is a more conservative version of the reverted CL 99135 (which
    was reverted in CL 137716)
    
    The net/url part rejects URLs with ASCII CTLs from being parsed and
    the net/http part rejects writing them if a bogus url.URL is
    constructed otherwise.
