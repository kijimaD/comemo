    runtime: increase GDB version testing requirement to 10 from 7.7
    
    Bump the required version of GDB up to 10 from 7.7 in the runtime GDB
    tests, so as to ensure that we have something that can handle DWARF 5
    when running tests. In theory there is some DWARF 5 support on the
    version 9 release branch, but we get "Dwarf Error: DW_FORM_addrx"
    errors for some archs on builders where GDB 9.2 is installed.
    
    Updates #26379.
