    math: optimize dim and remove s390x assembly implementation
    
    By calculating dim directly, rather than calling max, we can simplify
    the generated code significantly. The compiler now reports that dim
    is easily inlineable, but it can't be inlined because there is still
    an assembly stub for Dim.
    
    Since dim is now very simple I no longer think it is worth having
    assembly implementations of it. I have therefore removed the s390x
    assembly. Removing the other assembly for Dim is #21913.
    
    name  old time/op  new time/op  delta
    Dim   4.29ns ± 0%  3.53ns ± 0%  -17.62%  (p=0.000 n=9+8)
