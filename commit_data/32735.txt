    cmd/go: Document that -cover causes incorrect line numbers
    
    Due to the fact that -cover injects additional code to the original
    source, tests run with -cover will often have incorrect line numbers.
    
    Also includes docs for -list regexp missed by ba8ff87
    
    Updates #6329
