    debug/dwarf: read DWARF 5 cu base offsets on SeekPC() path
    
    This patch fixes a bug in CL 655976 relating to DWARF 5 support; we
    were reading in compile unit base offsets on the Seek() path but not
    on the corresponding SeekPC path (we need the offsets to be read in
    both cases).
    
    Updates #26379.
    Fixes #72778.
