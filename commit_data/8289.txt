    misc/cgo/test: run tests
    
    The new gotest ignores Test functions outside *_test.go files
    (the old shell script allowed them), so replace one clumsy hack
    with another.
    
    The root problem is that the package makefiles only know
    how to run cgo for source files in the package proper, not
    for test files.  Making it work for test files is probably more
    trouble than it's worth.
