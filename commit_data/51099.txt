    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: re-adjust CarryChainTail scheduling priority
    
    This needs to be as low as possible while not breaking priority
    assumptions of other scores to correctly schedule carry chains.
    
    Prior to the arm64 changes, it was set below ReadTuple. At the time,
    this prevented the MulHiLo implementation on PPC64 from occluding
    the scheduling of a full carry chain.
    
    Memory scores can also prevent better scheduling, as can be observed
    with crypto/internal/edwards25519/field.feMulGeneric.
    
    Fixes #56497
