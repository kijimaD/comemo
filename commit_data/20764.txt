    runtime: update heap dump format for 1.4
    
    We no longer have full type information in the heap, so
    we can't dump that any more.  Instead we dump ptr/noptr
    maps so at least we can compute graph connectivity.
    
    In addition, we still dump Iface/Eface types so together
    with dwarf type info we might be able to reconstruct
    types of most things in the heap.
