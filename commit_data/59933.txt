    reflect: restore ifaceIndir function for now
    
    CL 583755 removed all uses of the ifaceIndir function,
    and the function itself. Unfortunately, ifaceIndir is accessed
    using go:linkname by the popular github.com/goccy/go-json package.
    A bug has been filed to fix this upstream:
    https://github.com/goccy/go-json/issues/506
    Until that bug is fixed and the fix is distributed,
    keep this function available.
    With luck we can remove this in the 1.24 release.
    
    For #67279
