commit b2d1a2b513cb9a7ceaa1eb6d097f1ef2a84637dd

    container/heap: update example code
    
    - use Init to establish heap invariant on
      a non-empty heap
    - use Fix to update heap after an element's
      properties have been changed
    
    (The old code used Init where it wasn't needed,
     and didn't use Fix because Fix was added after
     the example was written.)
