    net/http: use TCP keep-alives for ListenAndServe and ListenAndServeTLS
    
    Our default behavior for the common cases shouldn't lead to
    leaked TCP connections (e.g. from people closing laptops) when
    their Go servers are exposed to the open Internet without a
    proxy in front.
    
    Too many users on golang-nuts have learned this the hard way.
    
    No API change. Only ListenAndServe and ListenAndServeTLS are
    updated.
