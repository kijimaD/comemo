    archive/tar: disable prefix field in Writer
    
    The proper fix for the Writer is too involved to be done in time
    for Go 1.8. Instead, we do a localized fix that simply disables the
    prefix encoding logic. While this will prevent some legitimate uses
    of prefix, it will ensure that we don't keep outputting invalid
    GNU format files that have the prefix field populated.
    
    For headers with long filenames that could have used the prefix field,
    they will be promoted to use the PAX format, which ensures that we
    will still be able to encode all headers that we were able to do before.
