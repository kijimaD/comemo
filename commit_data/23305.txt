    doc/progs: disable cgo tests that use C.Stdout on Solaris
    
    Solaris, like Windows, NetBSD and OpenBSD, uses macros for stdin, stdout,
    and stderr. Cgo can't access them without getters/setters written in
    C. Because of this we disable affected tests like for the other platforms.
    
    Updates #10715.
