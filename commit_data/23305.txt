    doc: updated language about the AUTHORS/CONTRIBUTORS update
    
    Reflect the process changes where AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS
    files are updated automatically based on commit logs
    and Google committers no longer need to do it manually
    on the first contributors.
    
    The documentation update will help to avoid requests to be
    added from new contributors.
