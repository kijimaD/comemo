    doc: make front page video respond to layout changes (1/2)
    
    The videos on the front page are always the same width, regardless of
    the viewport width. These changes let the video fill the space given
    to its container regardless of layout. It uses the standard hack for
    making iframes responsive, but the videos are loaded at random and do
    not have uniform aspect ratios so that information is injected into the
    DOM using custom properties. If these are not supported, it falls back
    to the same layout present before this change.
    
    Note: this change also requires CL 108678 to complete the fix,
    though either CL without the other is harmless.
    
    Updates #24997.
