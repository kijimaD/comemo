    doc/go1.15: remove TODO intended for the Core library section
    
    The TODO was added durring the initial creation of the document.
    In the current location, it makes it seem like the tzdata documents
    are incomplete when they are complete. It is understood that the
    entire Core library section will be a work in progress until the release.
    
    For #37419
