    cmd/internal/obj: separate code layout from object writing
    
    This will allow the compiler to crunch Prog lists down to code as each
    function is compiled, instead of waiting until the end, which should
    reduce the working set of the compiler. But not until Go 1.7.
    
    This also makes it easier to write some machine code output tests
    for the assembler, which is why it's being done now.
    
    For #13822.
