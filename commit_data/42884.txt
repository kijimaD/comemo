    cmd/go/internal/get: disallow non-ASCII unicode letters from import paths
    
    The copy of CheckImportPath in path.go and the regular expression for github
    repos in vcsPaths together allow import paths with unicode letters with import
    paths. These all come from github repos with non-ASCII unicode letters
    with paths in directories. This mainly shows up in GOPATH mode, but could
    also show up in Module mode when getting a module in GOPROXY=direct mode.
    
    We expect there to not be any significant affected users of this change--
    an investingation of github repos that would produce import paths that
    would comply with the copy CheckImportPaths that's being removed, but not
    modload.CheckImportPaths only surfaced a handful of cases, all of which
    seemed to be small test or demonstation repos. But this CL is being
    submitted early in the cycle so that it can be backed out if need be.
