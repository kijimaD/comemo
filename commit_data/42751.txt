    runtime: split PCs out of scase
    
    Per-case PCs are only needed for race detector builds, so this allows
    skipping allocating stack space for them for non-race builds.
    
    It's possible to arrange the PCs and order arrays consecutively in
    memory so that we could just reuse the order0 pointer to identify
    both. However, there's more risk of that silently going wrong, so this
    commit passes them as separate arguments for now. We can revisit this
    in the future.
    
    Updates #40410.
