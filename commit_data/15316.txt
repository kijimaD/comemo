    go/types: include package import path in NamedType.String().
    
    This avoids ambiguity and makes the diagnostics closer to
    those issued by gc, but it is more verbose since it qualifies
    intra-package references.
    
    Without extra context---e.g. a 'from *Package' parameter to
    Type.String()---we are forced to err on one side or the other.
    
    Also, cosmetic changes to exp/ssa:
    - Remove package-qualification workaround in Function.FullName.
    - Always set go/types.Package.Path field to the import path,
      since we know the correct path at this point.
    - In Function.DumpTo, show variadic '...' and result type info,
      and delete now-redundant "# Type: " line.
