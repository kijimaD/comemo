    spec: permit "for range x" (no index variables)
    
    This is a fully backward-compatible language change.
    
    There are not a lot of cases in the std library, but
    there are some. Arguably this makes the syntax a bit
    more regular - any trailing index variable that is _
    can be left away, and there's some analogy to type
    switches where the temporary can be left away.
    
    Implementation-wise the change should be trivial as
    it can be done completely syntactically. For instance,
    the respective change in go/parser is a dozen lines
    (see https://golang.org/cl/112970044 ).
    
    Fixes #6102.
