    cmd/internal/obj: index pcdata symbols in NumberSyms
    
    When writing an object file, most symbols are indexed in
    NumberSyms. Currently, pcdata symbols are indexed late and
    separately. This is not really necessary, as pcdata symbols
    already exist at the time of NumberSyms. Just do it there.
    
    As pcdata symbols are laid out in the pclntab in a special way at
    link time, distinguish them from other symbols in the content
    hash. (In the old code this was partly achieved by indexing them
    late.)
