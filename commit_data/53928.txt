    runtime: move pcvalue cache to M
    
    Currently, the pcvalue cache is stack allocated for each operation
    that needs to look up a lot of pcvalues. It's not always clear where
    to put it, a lot of the time we just pass a nil cache, it doesn't get
    reused across operations, and we put a surprising amount of effort
    into threading these caches around.
    
    This CL moves it to the M, where it can be long-lived and used by all
    pcvalue lookups, and we don't have to carefully thread it across
    operations.
