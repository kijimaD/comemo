    internal/sync: relax value type constraint for HashTrieMap
    
    Currently the HashTrieMap requires both keys and values to be
    comparable, but it's actually OK if the value is not comparable. Some
    operations may fail, but others will not, and we can check comparability
    dynamically on map initialization. This makes the implementation
    substantially more flexible.
