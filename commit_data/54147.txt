    cmd/compile: use better line numbers for write barriers
    
    When the write barrier does several pointer writes under one
    write barrier flag check, the line numbers aren't really correct.
    
    The writes inside the write barrier have a confusing set of positions.
    The loads of the old values are given the line number of the
    corresponding store instruction, but the stores into the write buffer
    are given the line number of the first store. Instead, give them all
    line numbers corresponding to the store instruction.
    
    The writes at the merge point, which are the original writes and the
    only ones that happen when the barrier is off, are currently all given
    the line number of the first write. Instead give them their original
    line number.
