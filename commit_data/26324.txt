    runtime: put g.waiting list in lock order
    
    Currently the g.waiting list created by a select is in poll order.
    However, nothing depends on this, and we're going to need access to
    the channel lock order in other places shortly, so modify select to
    put the waiting list in channel lock order.
    
    For #12967.
