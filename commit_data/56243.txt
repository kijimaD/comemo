    net/http: add field Cookie.Quoted bool
    
    The current implementation of the http package strips double quotes
    from the cookie-value during parsing, resulting in the serialized
    cookie not including them. This patch addresses this limitation by
    introducing a new field to track whether the original value was
    enclosed in quotes.
    
    Additionally, the internal representation of a cookie in the cookiejar
    package has been adjusted to align with the new representation.
    
    The syntax of cookies is outlined in RFC 6265 Section 4.1.1:
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265\#section-4.1.1
    
    Fixes #46443
