    cmd/gc: test temp string comparison with all ops
    
    The comment on `slicebytetostringtmp` mention that `==` operator does
    not allocate []byte to string conversion, but the test was testing only
    `==` and `!=` and the compiler actually optimizes all comparison
    operators.
    
    Also added a test for concatenation comparison, which also should not
    allocate.
