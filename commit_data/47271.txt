    cmd/link/internal/ld: deflake TestWindowsIssue36495
    
    Over a dozen of the ld tests were missing closes. That was less
    obvious before CL 299670 started using T.TempDir instead, which fails
    a test when the tempdir can't be cleaned up (as it can't on Windows
    when things are still open), insteading of leaving tempdirs around on
    disk after the test.
    
    Most of the missing closes were fixed in CL 299670, but the builders
    helpfully pointed out that I missed at least this one.
