    image: change Rectangle.Eq to return true for all empty rectangles, even
    if their nominal Min and Max points differ.
    
    This is a behavior change, but arguably a bug fix, as Eq wasn't
    previously consistent with In, and the concept of a rectangle being a
    set of points. This is demonstrated by the new geom_test.go test.
    
    It does mean that r.Eq(s) no longer implies that Inset'ting both r and s
    with a negative inset results in two rectangles that are still Eq, but
    that seems acceptable to me.
    
    The previous behavior is still available as "r == s".
    
    Also clarify the image.Rect doc comment when the inputs are
    non-canonical.
    
    Also simplify the Point and Rectangle Eq implementations dating from
    before Go 1.0, when you couldn't compare structs via the == operator.
