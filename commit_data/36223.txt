    net: reduce TestSplice/big's memory usage
    
    The old code used splice on a 2GB []byte when not in short mode, meaning
    that running 'go test net' when one had 4GB or less free memory would
    easily result in "out of memory" runtime panics.
    
    Instead, use a much smaller size that is still big enough to not fit
    into a single splice(2) syscall. The new size is just 5MB, so the test
    uses a fraction of the memory it used to, and there's no longer a need
    for a different size on short mode.
    
    This also speeds up the test, which goes from ~1.23s to ~0.01s on my
    laptop.
    
    Fixes #26867.
