    runtime: fix finalizer test on amd64
    
    Not scanning the stack by frames means we are reintroducing
    a few false positives into the collection. Run the finalizer registration
    in its own goroutine so that stack is guaranteed to be out of
    consideration in a later collection.
    
    This is working around a regression from yesterday's tip, but
    it's not a regression from Go 1.1.
