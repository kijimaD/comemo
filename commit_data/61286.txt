    internal/poll: handle the special case of sendfile(2) sending the full chunk
    
    CL 622235 would fix #70000 while resulting in one extra sendfile(2) system
    call when sendfile(2) returns (>0, EAGAIN).
    That's also why I left sendfile_bsd.go behind, and didn't make it line up
    with other two implementations: sendfile_linux.go and sendfile_solaris.go.
    
    Unlike sendfile(2)'s on Linux and Solaris that always return (0, EAGAIN),
    sendfile(2)'s on *BSD and macOS may return (>0, EAGAIN) when using a socket
    marked for non-blocking I/O. In that case, the current code will try to re-call
    sendfile(2) immediately, which will most likely get us a (0, EAGAIN).
    After that, it goes to `dstFD.pd.waitWrite(dstFD.isFile)` below,
    which should have been done in the first place.
    
    Thus, the real problem that leads to #70000 is that the old code doesn't handle
    the special case of sendfile(2) sending the exact number of bytes the caller requested.
    
    Fixes #70000
