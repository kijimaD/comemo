    cmd/compile: remove spurious ir.Dump
    
    This ir.Dump call is a debugging artifact introduced in
    golang.org/cl/274103, which should never be printed for valid,
    non-generic code, but evidently can now sometimes appear due to how
    the parser handles invalid syntax.
    
    The parser should probably not recognize "x[2]" as a type expression
    in non-generics mode, but also probably we shouldn't try noding after
    reporting syntax errors. Either way, this diagnostic has outlived its
    usefulness, and noder's days are numbered anyway, so we might as well
    just remove it to save end users any confusion.
    
    Updates #46558.
