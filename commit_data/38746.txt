    os: permit RemoveAll with paths that end in ".."
    
    Prohibiting RemoveAll with paths that end in ".." was added with
    CL 137442 in this release cycle, but it worked before and it should
    continue to work.
    
    Also run TestRemoveAllDot on all systems; the test is not specific to
    the use of unlinkat and friends.
