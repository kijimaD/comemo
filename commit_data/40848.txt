    doc: add glossary to module reference documentation
    
    These terms will be defined throughout the document, and more terms
    will be added. After drafting a few sections, it's clear that a
    glossary will be useful. There are enough terms that it would be
    overwhelming at the beginning.
    
    Also, add anchors for each heading and add a couple more headings.
