    go/types: ignore artificial cycles introduced via method declarations
    
    At the moment, method declarations are type-checked together with
    they receiver base types. This is a known problem (to be fixed early
    for Go 1.12) but with the new cycle detection algorithm now also
    introduced artifical type cycles.
    
    This change pushes a special marker on the cycle path in those cases
    so that these cycles can be ignored.
    
    Fixes #26124.
