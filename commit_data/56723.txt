    cmd/cgo/internal/testsanitizers: make the libfuzzer tests all short
    
    CL 589295 only made one of the two tests short, because the other one
    seemed to be passing consistently in short mode. On the builders, it
    seems to still fail maybe 30% of the time by taking too long. Disable
    these tests in short mode.
    
    For #67698.
