    go/doc: recognize methods on generic types as Funcs
    
    When writing markdown for godoc, we can reference a method M of
    a type T as [T.M]. This doesn't currently work for methods on generic
    types because the declaration of the type parameter gets in the way.
    (You'd have to write [T[P].M] and that doesn't parse, and even if it
    did you'd have to spell "P" correctly.)
    
    Get rid of the type parameter when building the list of Funcs so
    [T.M] works in godoc if T is generic.
