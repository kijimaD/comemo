    internal/trace/v2: don't enforce batch order on Ms
    
    Currently the trace parser enforces that the timestamps for a series of
    a batches on the same M come in order. We cannot actually assume this in
    general because we don't trust timestamps. The source of truth on the
    batch order is the order in which they were emitted. If that's wrong, it
    should quickly become evident in the trace.
    
    For #60773.
    For #64061.
