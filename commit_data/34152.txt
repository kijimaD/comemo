    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: fix handling of unaligned offset between 256 and 504
    
    C_PPAUTO was matching offsets that is a multiple 8. But this
    condition is dropped in CL 55610, causing unaligned offset
    between 256 and 504 mistakenly matched to some classes, e.g.
    C_UAUTO8K. This CL restores this condition, also fixes an
    error that C_PPAUTO shouldn't match C_PSAUTO, because the
    latter is not guaranteed to be multiple of 8. C_PPAUTO_8 is
    unnecessary, removed.
    
    Fixes #21992.
