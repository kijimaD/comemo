    runtime, testing/synctest: breaking bubble isolation with Cond is fatal
    
    sync.Cond.Wait is durably blocking. Waking a goroutine out of Cond.Wait
    from outside its bubble panics.
    
    Make this panic a fatal panic, since it leaves the notifyList in an
    inconsistent state. We could do some work to make this a recoverable
    panic, but the complexity doesn't seem worth the outcome.
    
    For #67434
