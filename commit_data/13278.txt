    math/big: improved karatsuba calibration code, better mul benchmark
    
    An attempt to profit from CL 6176043 (fix to superpolinomial
    runtime of karatsuba multiplication) and determine a better
    karatsuba threshold. The result indicates that 32 is still
    a reasonable value. Left the threshold as is (== 32), but
    made some minor changes to the calibrate code which are
    worthwhile saving (use of existing benchmarking code for
    better results, better use of package time).
