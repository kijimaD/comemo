    runtime/internal/atomic: add wasm And/Or operators
    
    In the WebAssembly version of these operators we avoid using
    a CAS loop since the Go wasm implementation is single-threaded.
    
    A new test file has been added that has build tags in order to
    only test this feature on implemented architectures.
    
    This is part of a series of CLs aimed to add the primitives
    for And/Or atomic operations that will be used by the public
    sync/atomic apis.
    
    For #61395
