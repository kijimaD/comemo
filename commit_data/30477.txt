    cmd/go: fix TestFFLAGS for Fortran compilers that accept unknown options
    
    The test assumed that passing an unknown option to the Fortran
    compiler would cause the compiler to fail. Unfortunately it appears
    that some succeed. It's irrelevant to the actual test, which is
    verifying that the flag was indeed passed.
    
    Fixes #19080.
