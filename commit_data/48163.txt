    net: in TestNotTemporaryRead, do not assume that a dialed connection has been accepted
    
    Previously, TestNotTemporaryRead issued the Read on the Accept side of
    the connection, and Closed the Dial side. It appears that on some
    platforms, Dial may return before the connection has been Accepted,
    and if that connection is immediately closed with no bytes written and
    SO_LINGER set to 0, the connection may no longer even exist by the
    time Accept returns, causing Accept to block indefinitely until the
    Listener is closed.
    
    If we were to just swap the directions, we would have an analogous
    problem: Accept could accept the connection and close it before the
    client even finishes dialing, causing Dial (instead of Read) to return
    the ECONNRESET error.
    
    Here, we take a middle path: we Accept and Dial the connection
    concurrently, but wait until both the Accept and the Dial have
    returned (indicating that the connection is completely established and
    won't vanish from the accept queue) before resetting the connection.
    
    Fixes #29685
