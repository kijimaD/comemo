    runtime: fix build
    
    'range hash' makes a copy of the hash array in the stack, creating
    a very large stack frame. It's just the right amount that it
    uses most but not all of the total stack size. If you have a lot
    of environment variables, like the builders, then this is too
    much and the g0 stack runs out of space.
