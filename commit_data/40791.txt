    os/exec: skip poll descriptors when checking for open descriptors
    
    It turns out that there is a path that initializes netpoll and opens
    file descriptors before running the os/exec init function: on some
    systems, the uses of NewFile when setting os.Stdin and friends can
    initialize netpoll which can open file descriptors. This in itself
    is not a problem, but when we check whether the new files are open
    using os.NewFile, a side-effect is to put them into non-blocking mode.
    This can then break future uses of netpoll.
