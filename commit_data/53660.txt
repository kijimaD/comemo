    net/http: add errors.As support for x/net/http2.StreamError
    
    To make it easier to extract the HTTP/2 error code (if any) from
    net/http errors, implement an As method on the vendored copy of
    golang.org/x/net/http2.StreamError. The new As method lets users work
    with the vendored error type as though it were the x/net/http2
    StreamError.
    
    Fixes #53896.
