    runtime: clean up redundant calls to SetGCPercent in debug_test.go
    
    SetGCPercent(-1) is called by several tests in debug_test.go (followed
    by a call to runtime.GC) due to #49370. However, startDebugCallWorker
    already actually has this, just without the runtime.GC call (allowing an
    in-progress GC to still mess up the test).
    
    This CL consolidates SetGCPercent into startDebugDebugCallWorker where
    applicable.
