    cmd/internal/objabi: make GOEXPERIMENT=none mean "no experiment flags"
    
    CL 307819 made GOEXPERIMENT=none mean "restore baseline experiment
    configuration". This is arguably what you want because any deviation
    from the baseline configuration is an "experiment". However, cmd/dist
    requires this to mean "disable all experiment flags", even if some
    flags are enabled in the baseline configuration, because its build
    system doesn't know how to deal with any enabled experiment flags.
    
    Hence, make GOEXPERIMENT=none mean "disable all experiment flags"
    again.
