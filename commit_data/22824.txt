    cmd/internal/obj: clean up Biobuf
    
    This is a follow up to rev 443a32e707d2 which reduces some of the
    duplication between methods and functions that operate on obj.Biobuf.
    
    obj.Biobuf has Flush and Write methods as well as helpers which duplicate
    those methods, consolidate on the former and remove the latter.
    
    Also, address a final comment from CL 9525.
