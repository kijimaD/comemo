    misc/emacs: Add support for godef
    
    godef[1][2] is a third party tool for printing information about
    expressions, especially the location of their definition. This can be
    used to implement a "jump to definition" function. Unlike
    cross-language solutions like ctags, godef does not require an index,
    operates on the Go AST instead of symbols and works across packages,
    including the standard library.
    
    This patch implements two new public functions: godef-describe (C-c
    C-d) and godef-jump (C-d C-j). godef-describe describes the expression
    at point, printing its type, and godef-jump jumps to its definition.
