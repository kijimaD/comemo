    go/printer: fix format with leading comments in composite literal
    
    This fix is less pervasive than it seems. The only change affecting
    formatting is on printer.go:760. The remaining changes have no effect
    on formatting since the value of p.level is ignored except on this
    specific line.
    
    The remaining changes are:
    - renamed adjBlock to funcBody since that's how it is used
    - introduced new printer field 'level' tracking the composite
      literal nesting level
    - update/restore the composite literal nesting level as needed
    
    Fixes #18782.
