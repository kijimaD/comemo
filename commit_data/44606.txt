    syscall: use runtime.KeepAlive for ProcThreadAttributeList arguments
    
    It turns out that if you write Go pointers to Go memory, the Go compiler
    must be involved so that it generates various calls to the GC in the
    process. Letting Windows write Go pointers to Go memory violated this.
    So, we replace that with just a boring call to runtime.KeepAlive. That's
    not a great API, but this is all internal code anyway. We fix it up
    more elegantly for external consumption in x/sys/windows with CL 300369.
    
    Fixes #44900.
