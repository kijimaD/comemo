    cmd/go: simplify code, reduce allocations.
    
    This is a trivial change to make use of an existing `nl` byte slice
    containing a single '\n' character. It's already declared and
    used in another place in this file, so it might as well be used
    in the other location instead of
    a new slice literal. There should be no change in behavior,
    aside from potentially less allocations.
    
    This is my first CL, so I wanted to use a simple, hopefully non-controversial,
    minor improvement to get more comfortable with golang contribution process.
