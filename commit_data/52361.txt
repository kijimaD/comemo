    cmd/compile/internal/types2: respect commaerr in Checker.exprList
    
    The changes to exprList (in call.go), made in CL 282193, didn't
    get faithfully ported to types2: in the case of operand mode
    commaerr, unpacking didn't correctly set the type of the 2nd
    value to error. This shouldn't matter for the compiler, but
    the code differs from the go/types version. Make them the same.
