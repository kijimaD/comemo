    cmd/gc: accept switches on comparable arrays.
    
    The compiler is incorrectly rejecting switches on arrays of
    comparable types. It also doesn't catch incomparable structs
    when typechecking the switch, leading to unreadable errors
    during typechecking of the generated code.
    
    Fixes #3894.
