    runtime: fix build after CL 9164 on Linux
    
    There is an assumption that the function executed in child thread
    created by runtime.close should not return. And different systems
    enforce that differently: some exit that thread, some exit the
    whole process.
    
    The test TestNewOSProc0 introduced in CL 9161 breaks that assumption,
    so we need to adjust the code to only exit the thread should the
    called function return.
