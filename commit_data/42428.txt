    text/template: indirect interfaces before slicing
    
    The recently added slice function used indirectInterface, but then
    forgot to actually call reflect.Value.Slice on its result. Calling the
    Slice method on the original Value without indirectInterface would
    result in a panic, if our slice was indeed behind an interface.
    
    Fix that, and add test cases for all three built-in functions that work
    with slices.
    
    Fixes #36199.
