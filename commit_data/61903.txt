    runtime: migrate missing map linkname allowlists
    
    The swissmap implementation forgot to copy some of the linkname
    allowlists from the old implementation. Copy them from map_noswiss.go.
    Some were missing linkname entirely; others were linknamed but missing
    the hall of shame comment.
    
    For #54766.
