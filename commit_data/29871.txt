    runtime: avoid CreateThread panic when exiting process
    
    On Windows, CreateThread occasionally fails with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
    We're not sure why this is, but the Wine source code suggests that
    this can happen when there's a concurrent CreateThread and ExitProcess
    in the same process.
    
    Fix this by setting a flag right before calling ExitProcess and
    halting if CreateThread fails and this flag is set.
    
    Updates #18253 (might fix it, but we're not sure this is the issue and
    can't reproduce it on demand).
