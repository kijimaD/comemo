commit 85d09574fd2ed789eb5550a04eae1d261aaf4d17

    runtime: fallback to 128M address space on 32bit
    
    Available darwin/arm devices sporadically have trouble mapping 256M.
    
    I would really appreciate it if anyone could check my working on
    this, and make sure sure there aren't obviously bad consequences I
    haven't considered.
