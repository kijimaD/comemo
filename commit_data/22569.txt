    runtime: Remove write barrier on g
    
    There are calls to stdcall when the GC thinks the world is stopped
    and stdcall write a *g for the CPU profiler. This produces a write
    barrier but the GC is not prepared to deal with write barriers when
    it thinks the world is stopped. Since the g is on allg it does not
    need a write barrier to keep it alive so eliminate the write barrier.
