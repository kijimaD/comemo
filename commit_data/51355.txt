    runtime/race: be less picky about test run time
    
    Currently, there are two regexps in the race detector output tests
    that assume subtests will complete in < 1 second. This isn't necessary
    and very occasionally fails (on builders that are probably very
    loaded). Make these tests less picky about timing.
    
    Fixes #50612.
