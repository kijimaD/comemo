    cmd/compile: remove legacy debug flags
    
    -M, -P, and -R were for debugging backend passes that no longer
    exists.
    
    -g is used for debugging instructions generated with Gins, but the SSA
    backend mostly generates instructions directly. The handful of
    instructions still generated with Gins are pretty useless for
    debugging.
    
    -x was used to debug the old lexer, but now it only causes us to print
    file names as they're parsed, and only if we manually hack the
    compiler to enable tracing.
