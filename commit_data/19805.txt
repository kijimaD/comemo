    liblink: more precise literal word comparison on arm
    
    There are fields in the Addr that do not matter for the
    purpose of deciding that the same word is already
    in the current literal pool. Copy only the fields that
    do matter.
    
    This came up when comparing against the Go version
    because the way it is invoked doesn't copy a few fields
    (like node) that are never directly used by liblink itself.
    
    Also remove a stray print that is not well-defined in
    the new liblink. (Cannot use %D outside of %P, because
    %D needs the outer Prog*.)
