    runtime: make Go and C mallocgc signatures match
    
    Previously, the flags argument to mallocgc was an int in Go,
    but a uint32 in C.  Change the Go type to use uint32 so these
    agree.  The largest flag value is 2 (and of course no flag
    values are negative), so this won't change anything on little
    endian architectures, but it matters on big endian.
