    cmd/compile: eliminate dead code
    
    During walkexpr, we were assessing whether shifts were bounded.
    However, that information was dropped on the floor during SSA conversion.
    The SSA backend already finds all bounded shifts that walkexpr could have,
    and at negligible extra cost (0.02% in alloc, CPU undetectable).
