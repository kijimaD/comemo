    cmd/vet: add support for vet-specific export data
    
    An upcoming change to cmd/go will enable this functionality, which
    allows vet to write down information about one package for use by
    later invocation of vet that analyze code importing that package.
    
    We've intended to do this for a long time, but the build caching was
    necessary to have a decent way to manage the vet-specific export data.
    
    This is also an experiment in building scalable whole-program analyses.
    In the long term we'd like to allow other analyses to be invoked this way.
