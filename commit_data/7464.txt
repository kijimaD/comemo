+
+<pre>
+This release includes changes to the io and template packages.
+You may need to update your code.
+
+The io.ReadByter and io.ReadRuner interface types have been renamed to
+io.ByteReader and io.RuneReader respectively.
+
+The order of arguments to template.Execute has been reversed to be consistent
+the notion of "destination first", as with io.Copy, fmt.Fprint, and others.
+
+Gotest now works for package main in directories using Make.cmd-based makefiles.
+
+The memory allocation runtime problems from the last release are not completely
+fixed.  The virtual memory exhaustion problems encountered by people using
+ulimit -v have been fixed, but there remain known garbage collector problems
+when using GOMAXPROCS > 1.
