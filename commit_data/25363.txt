    net/http/httptest: fix comment regarding certificate expiry
    
    In earlier versions of Go, times were only encoded as an ASN.1 UTCTIME and
    crypto/tls/generate_cert.go limited times to the maximum UTCTIME value.
    Revision 050b60a3 added support for ASN.1 GENERALIZEDTIME, allowing larger
    time values to be represented (per RFC 5280).
    
    As a result, when the httptest certificate was regenerated in revision
    9b2d84ef, the Not After date changed to Jan 29 16:00:00 2084 GMT. Update
    the comment to reflect this.
