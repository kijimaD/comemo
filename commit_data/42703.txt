    runtime: simplify heapBitsSetType doubleCheck
    
    The heapBitsSetType function has a slow doubleCheck debugging mode
    that checks the bitmap written out by the rest of the function using
    far more obvious logic. But even this has some surprisingly complex
    logic in it. Simplify it a bit. This also happens to fix the logic on
    32-bit.
    
    Fixes #40335.
