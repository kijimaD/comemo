    runtime: update gctrace line for new garbage collector
    
    GODEBUG=gctrace=1 turns on a per-GC cycle trace line. The current line
    is left over from the STW garbage collector and includes a lot of
    information that is no longer meaningful for the concurrent GC and
    doesn't include a lot of information that is important.
    
    Replace this line with a new line designed for the new garbage
    collector.
    
    This new line is focused more on helping the user understand the
    impact of the garbage collector on their program and less on telling
    us, the runtime developers, everything that's happening inside
    GC. It's designed to fit in 80 columns and intentionally omit some
    potentially useful things that were in the old line. We might want a
    "verbose" mode that adds information for us.
    
    We'll be able to further simplify the line once we eliminate the STW
    around enabling the write barrier. Then we'll have just one STW phase,
    one concurrent phase, and one more STW phase, so we'll be able to
    reduce the number of times from five to three.
