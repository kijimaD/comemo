    exp/ssa: fixed bug (typo) in findPromotedField.
    
    By appending to the wrong (always empty) list, only the last
    anonymous field was being considered for promotion.
    
    Also:
    - eliminated "function-local NamedTypes" TODO; nothing to do.
    - fixed Function.DumpTo: printing of anon receivers was "( T)",
      now "(T)"; extracted writeSignature into own function.
    - eliminated blockNames function;
      thanks to BasicBlock.String, "%s" of []*BasicBlock is fine.
    - extracted buildReferrers into own function.
    
    exp/ssa can now build its own transitive closure.
