    cmd/vet: use go/printer to pretty-print expressions in printf messages
    Fixes #4945.
    Most examples in this issue now better, but #10 is incomplete and I'm not
    certain how to reproduce it. It actually looks like a go/types problem, since
    the type being reported is coming directly from that package.
    Please reopen the issue if you disagree.
