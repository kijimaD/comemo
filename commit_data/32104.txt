    runtime: fix gcpacertrace printing of sweep ratio
    
    Commit 44ed88a5a7 moved printing of the "sweep done" gcpacertrace
    message so that it is printed when the final sweeper finishes.
    However, by this point some other thread has often already observed
    that there are no more spans to sweep and zeroed sweepPagesPerByte.
    
    Avoid printing a 0 sweep ratio in the trace when this race happens by
    getting the value of the sweep ratio upon entry to sweepone and
    printing that.
