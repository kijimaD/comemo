    runtime: make sysReserve return page-aligned memory on js-wasm
    
    This change ensures js-wasm returns page-aligned memory. While today
    its lack of alignment doesn't cause problems, this is an invariant of
    sysAlloc which is documented in HACKING.md but isn't upheld by js-wasm.
    
    Any code that calls sysAlloc directly for small structures expects a
    certain alignment (e.g. debuglog, tracebufs) but this is not maintained
    by js-wasm's sysAlloc.
    
    Where sysReserve comes into play is that sysAlloc is implemented in
    terms of sysReserve on js-wasm. Also, the documentation of sysReserve
    says that the returned memory is "OS-aligned" which on most platforms
    means page-aligned, but the "OS-alignment" on js-wasm is effectively 1,
    which doesn't seem right either.
    
    The expected impact of this change is increased memory use on wasm,
    since there's no way to decommit memory, and any small structures
    allocated with sysAlloc won't be packed quite as tightly. However, any
    memory increase should be minimal. Most calls to sysReserve and sysAlloc
    already aligned their request to physPageSize before calling it; there
    are only a few circumstances where this is not true, and they involve
    allocating an amount of memory returned by unsafe.Sizeof where it's
    actually quite important that we get the alignment right.
    
    Updates #35112.
