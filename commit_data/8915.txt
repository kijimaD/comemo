    goinstall: Add support for generic hosts using special import form
    
    This change extends goinstall to support "magic" package names of the
    form:
            <host>/<repo>.<vcs>/<path>
    
    Where <host> is the hostname, <repo> the path to the repository, <vcs>
    the type of vcs (git, hg, bzr or svn), and <path> is the path inside the
    repository that contains the source code for the package.
    
    For example: "example.com/pub/foo.hg/src" means download the Mercurial
    repository at either pub/foo.hg or pub/foo from example.com and then
    build and install the source files from src inside the repository
    checkout.
    
    Repositories on the built-in hostings sites (github, bitbucket,
    launchpad and googlecode) must still use the old form (i.e.
    github.com/xxx/yyy.git/src will be rejected).
