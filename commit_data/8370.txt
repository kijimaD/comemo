    image/tiff: Reject images with SampleFormat != 1.
    
    The TIFF spec says that a baseline TIFF reader must gracefully terminate
    when the image has a SampleFormat tag which it does not support.
    For baseline compatibility, only SampleFormat=1 (the default) is needed.
    Images with other sample formats (e.g. floating-point color values)
    are very rare in practice.
