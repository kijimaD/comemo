    net/http: configure http2 transport only once
    
    it looks like we should abort trying to configure the http2 transport
    again, once it has been configured already.
    
    Otherwise there will be no effect of these checks and changes, as they
    will be overridden later again and the disable logic below will have no
    effect, too.
    
    So it really looks like we just forgot a return statement here.
