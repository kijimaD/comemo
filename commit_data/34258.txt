    runtime: don't restore the alternate signal stack on ios
    
    The alternative signal stack doesn't work on ios, so the setup of
    the alternative stack was skipped. The corresponding unminitSignals
    was effectively a no-op on ios until CL 70130. Skip unminitSignals
    on ios to restore the previous behaviour.
    
    For the ios builders.
