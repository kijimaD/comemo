    cmd/link: don't link sections not named .o
    
    For many build systems, modular static analysis is most conveniently
    implemented by saving analysis facts (which are analogous to export
    data) in an additional section in the archive file, similar to
    __PKGDEF. See golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis for an overview.
    
    Because such sections are not object files, the linker must not
    attempt to link them. This change causes the linker to skip special
    sections whose name does not end with .o (and is short enough not to
    be truncated).
    
    Fixes #28429
