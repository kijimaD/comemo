    runtime: remove race and increase precision in pointer validation.
    
    This CL removes the single and racy use of mheap.arena_end outside
    of the bookkeeping done in mHeap_init and mHeap_Alloc.
    There should be no way for heapBitsForSpan to see a pointer to
    an invalid span. This CL makes the check for this more precise by
    checking that the pointer is between mheap_.arena_start and
    mheap_.arena_used instead of mheap_.arena_end.
