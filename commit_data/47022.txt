commit 078f08f0ee1eb6cb172fc1f9d53f34c5783e522d
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    spec: every type has a method set (minor clarification)
    
    The spec states that a type "may" have a method set associated with it.
    Yet every type has a method set, which may be empty. This is clarified
    later in the same paragraph. Be clear in the first sentence as well.
    
    Per the suggestion from https://github.com/DQNEO.
    
    Fixes #44318.
