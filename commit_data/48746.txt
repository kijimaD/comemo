    runtime: align m.procid to 8 bytes on 32-bit systems
    
    https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/383434 started using
    atomic Load64 on this field, which breaks 32 bit platforms which
    require 64-bit alignment of uint64s that are passed to atomic operations.
    
    Not sure why this doesn't break everywhere, but I saw it break on
    my laptop during all.bash.
