    runtime: add benchmark of heapBitsSetType
    
    There was an old benchmark that measured this indirectly
    via allocation, but I don't understand how to factor out the
    allocation cost when interpreting the numbers.
    
    Replace with a benchmark that only calls heapBitsSetType,
    that does not allocate. This was not possible when the
    benchmark was first written, because heapBitsSetType had
    not been factored out of mallocgc.
