    runtime: fix assist utilization computation
    
    When commit 510fd13 enabled assists during the scan phase, it failed
    to also update the code in the GC controller that computed the assist
    CPU utilization and adjusted the trigger based on it. Fix that code so
    it uses the start of the scan phase as the wall-clock time when
    assists were enabled rather than the start of the mark phase.
