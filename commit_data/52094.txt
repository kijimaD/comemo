    doc/go_spec.html: update type identity example
    
    In the Type identity section, the example provides various types as givens.
    
    The example refers to the type *T5, but it is not provided in the givens.
    
    I am assuming this was a typo, and was meant to refer to *A1 or *B1.
    *B1 seems to be in alignment with the rest of the provided examples.
