    cmd/api: be more robust against OS deleting temp files
    
    OS X in particular deletes tmp files (but not directories)
    pretty reliably.
    
    Ask hg whether the go.tools directory in tmp is good before
    using it.
    
    Fixes issue Rob and others were reporting, which I just hit
    myself now.
