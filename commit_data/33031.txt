    doc: mention testing/quick RNG seeding change in Go 1.9 notes
    
    Also reword the testing/quick.Config field docs to conform to the
    normal subject-first style. Without that style, godoc links
    /pkg/testing/quick/#Config.Rand to the wrong line, since it doesn't
    recognize the preceding comment as necessarily being attached.
    
    Fixes #20809
