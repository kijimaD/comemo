    cmd/compile: don't emit autom's into object file
    
    Don't write Autom records when writing a function to the object file;
    we no longer need them in the linker for DWARF processing. So as to
    keep the object file format unchanged, write out a zero-length list of
    automs to the object, as opposed to removing all references.
    
    Updates #34554.
