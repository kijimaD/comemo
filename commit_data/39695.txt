    builtin: make len's godoc less ambiguous
    
    The len godoc uses a blockquote to list the rules for its semantics.
    
    The item that describes channels is a bit long, so it's split in two
    lines. However, the first line ends with a semicolon, and the second
    line can be read as a sentence of its own, so it's easy to misinterpret
    that the two lines are separate.
    
    Making that easy mistake would lead to an incorrect understanding of
    len:
    
            if v is nil, len(v) is zero.
    
    This could lead us to think that len(nil) is valid and should return
    zero. When in fact, that statement only applies to nil channels.
    
    To make this less ambiguous, add a bit of indentation to the follow-up
    line, to align with the channel body. If lists are added to godoc in the
    future via #7873, perhaps this text can be simplified.
    
    Fixes #30349.
