    cmd/link: for -buildmode=exe pass -no-pie to external linker
    
    On some systems the external linker defaults to PIE. On some systems
    DT_TEXTREL does not work correctly. When both are true we have a bad
    situation: any Go program built with the default buildmode (exe) that
    uses external linking will fail to run. Fix this by passing -no-pie to
    the external linker, if the option is supported.
    
    Fixes #17847.
