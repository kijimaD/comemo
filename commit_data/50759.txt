    os/exec: recombine goroutinePipes and userPipes
    
    This change undoes CL 401894, because on further consideration
    it turns out not to be needed.
    
    This also makes (*Cmd).closeDescriptors a free function, since it does
    not actually use the receiver in any way and is not needed to satisfy
    any interfaces.
    
    For #50436.
