    runtime: fix hard goal calculation
    
    The new GC pacer has a bug where the hard goal isn't set in relation to
    the original heap goal, but rather to the one already extrapolated for
    overshoot.
    
    In practice, I have never once seen this case arise because the
    extrapolated goal used for overshoot is conservative. No test because
    writing a test for this case is impossible in the idealized model the
    pacer tests create. It is possible to simulate but will take more work.
    For now, just leave a TODO.
