    cmd/link: fix handling of cgo_dynamic_interpreter
    
    CL 27473 accidentally changed `!Debug['I']` to `*flagInterpreter != ""`.
    Since the old `Debug['I']` was set when the new *flagInterpreter was
    set, this inverted the sense of the condition. The effect was to always
    ignore the cgo_dynamic_interpreter setting from runtime/cgo. This worked
    OK when the default interpreter was the correct one, but failed when it
    was not, as is currently the case on, at least, PPC64 and ARM.
    
    This CL restores the old behavior by using a separate variable to track
    whether the -I flag was used, just as we used to.
