    cmd/dist: skip the staleness check for 'cmd' when testing on aix-ppc64
    
    The gcc toolchain on the aix-ppc64 builder apparently does not achieve
    reproducible builds for packages that use cgo, which causes the
    binaries in cmd that use package "net" (cmd/go, cmd/pprof, and
    cmd/trace) to appear stale whenever the Go build cache is cleared.
    
    For now, we work around the staleness by rebuilding std and simply not
    checking whether cmd is stale.
    
    For #56896.
    Updates #47257.
