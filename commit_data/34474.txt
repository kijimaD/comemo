    cmd/compile, cmd/link: support for DWARF file reference relocations
    
    New relocation flavor R_DWARFFILEREF, to be applied to DWARF attribute
    values that correspond to file references (ex: DW_AT_decl_file,
    DW_AT_call_file). The LSym for this relocation is the file itself; the
    linker replaces the relocation target with the index of the specified
    file in the line table's file section.
    
    Note: for testing purposes this patch changes the DWARF function
    subprogram DIE abbrev to include DW_AT_decl_file (allowed by DWARF
    but not especially useful) so as to have a way to test this
    functionality. This attribute will be removed once there are other
    file reference attributes (coming as part of inlining support).
