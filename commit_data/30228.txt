    html/template, text/template: drop defined template list from errors
    
    The report in #17414 points out that if you have many many templates,
    then this is an overwhelming list and just hurts the signal-to-noise ratio of the error.
    
    Even the test of the old behavior also supports the idea that this is noise:
    
            template: empty: "empty" is an incomplete or empty template; defined templates are: "secondary"
    
    The chance that someone mistyped "secondary" as "empty" is slim at best.
    
    Similarly, the compiler does not augment an error like 'unknown variable x'
    by dumping the full list of all the known variables.
    
    For all these reasons, drop the list.
    
    Fixes #17414.
