    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: eliminate ~700 conversions by tweaking signatures
    
    This is mostly changing the opXXX helpers to take an int16 (matching Prog.As)
    argument and return a uint32. The only bit that's not completely trivial is
    passing -p.As to opirr to signal operating on a shifted constant, because AADD
    + ALAST overflows int16.
