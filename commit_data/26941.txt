    runtime: make sync_atomic_SwapPointer signature match sync/atomic
    
    SwapPointer is declared as
    
      func SwapPointer(addr *unsafe.Pointer, new unsafe.Pointer) (old unsafe.Pointer)
    
    in sync/atomic, but defined in the runtime (where it's actually
    implemented) as
    
      func sync_atomic_SwapPointer(ptr unsafe.Pointer, new unsafe.Pointer) unsafe.Pointer
    
    Make ptr a *unsafe.Pointer in the runtime definition to match the type
    in sync/atomic.
