    cmd/compile: allow spaces in types.(*Type).LinkString()
    
    Go back to allowing spaces in types.(*Type).LinkSring().
    
    Delve folks prefer that there are spaces in type names, if needed, since
    DWARF expects type names to be "a string representing the name as it
    appears in the source program". At this point, it doesn't necessarily
    seem worth having a separate function that removes spaces, only for use
    when printing the type names in a function/method instantiation.
    
    Most names of function/method instantiations will still not have spaces,
    since they most type args are named or builtin types. I confirmed that
    we are back to the original definition of LinkString(), except for some
    comment changes.
