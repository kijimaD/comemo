    runtime: simplify setPanicOnFault slightly
    
    No need to acquire the M just to change G's paniconfault flag, and the
    original C implementation of SetPanicOnFault did not. The M
    acquisition logic is an artifact of golang.org/cl/131010044, which was
    started before golang.org/cl/123640043 (which introduced the current
    "getg" function) was submitted.
