    go test: don't try to print package with error message.
    If there's a error compiling a _test.go file, the error
    message tries to print a *Package with %s. There's no String
    method on *Package, so the error message looks bad.
    Since the error messages identify the file in question
    anyway, this CL removes the package from the error message.
