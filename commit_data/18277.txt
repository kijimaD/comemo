    crypto/cipher: improved cbc performance
    
    decrypt: reduced the number of copy calls from 2n to 1.
    encrypt: reduced the number of copy calls from n to 1.
    
    Encryption is straight-forward: use dst instead of tmp when
    xoring the block with the iv.
    
    Decryption now loops backwards through the blocks abusing the
    fact that the previous block's ciphertext (src) is the iv. This
    means we don't need to copy the iv every time, in addition to
    using dst instead of tmp like encryption.
