    cmd/link: load external ELF PPC64 objects which set st_other=1
    
    This indicates the symbol does not use or preserve the TOC pointer in
    R2. Likewise, it does not have a distinct local entry point. This
    happens when gcc compiles an object with -mcpu=power10.
    
    Recycle the SymLocalentry field of a text symbol to pass through this
    hint as the bogus value 1 (A valid offset must be a multiple of 4
    bytes), and update the usage to check and generate errors further into
    the linking process. This matches the behavior of st_other as used by
    ELFv2.
