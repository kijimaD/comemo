    5l, 8l: pass stack frame size to morestack when needed
    
    Shame on me: I fixed the same bug in 6l in 8691fcc6a66e
    (https://golang.org/cl/2609041) and neglected
    to look at 5l and 8l to see if they were affected.
    
    On the positive side, the check I added in that CL is the
    one that detected this bug.
    
    Fixes #1457.
