    net: add test for Conn, PacketConn and Listener
    
    I just realized that there is no good place for adding
    exposed function or method tests because server, unicast
    and multicast_test.go do test complicated multiple test
    objects, platform behaviros, protocol behaviors and API,
    at the same time. Perhaps splitting them into per test
    object might be better, so this CL provides tests focused
    on API.
