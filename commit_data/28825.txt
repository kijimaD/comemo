    runtime: initialize hash algs before typemap
    
    When compiling with -buildmode=shared, a map[int32]*_type is created for
    each extra module mapping duplicate types back to a canonical object.
    This is done in the function typelinksinit, which is called before the
    init function that sets up the hash functions for the map
    implementation. The result is typemap becomes unusable after
    runtime initialization.
    
    The fix in this CL is to move algorithm init before typelinksinit in
    the runtime setup process. (For 1.8, we may want to turn typemap into
    a sorted slice of types and use binary search.)
    
    Manually tested on GOOS=linux with:
    
            GOHOSTARCH=386 GOARCH=386 ./make.bash && \
                    go install -buildmode=shared std && \
                    cd ../test && \
                    go run run.go -linkshared
    
    Fixes #16590
