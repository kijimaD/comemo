    encoding/json: remove suggestion on Unmarshaler with JSON null
    
    It is not true that Unmarshal always treats a JSON null
    as being equivalent to a no-op.
    For bools, ints, uints, floats, strings, arrays, and structs,
    it treats a JSON null as a no-op. However, for []byte, slice,
    map, pointer, or interface, it zeros the underlying value.
    
    Remove this suggestion as the actual behavior is inconsistent.
    
    Note that the proposed behavior in v2 Unmarshal is to consistently
    zero out the underlying value.
