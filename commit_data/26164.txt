    runtime: Plan 9 - prevent preemption by GC while exiting
    
    On Plan 9, there's no "kill all threads" system call, so exit is done
    by sending a "go: exit" note to each OS process.  If concurrent GC
    occurs during this loop, deadlock sometimes results.  Prevent this by
    incrementing m.locks before sending notes.
