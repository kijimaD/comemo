    cmd/gc: fix inlining internal error with T.Method calls.
    
    The compiler was confused when inlining a T.Method(f()) call
    where f returns multiple values: support for this was marked
    as TODO.
    
    Variadic calls are not supported but are not inlined either.
    Add a test preventively for that case.
    
    Fixes #4167.
