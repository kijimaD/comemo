    net: add initial MPTCP support
    
    This currently defines an internal function supportsMultipathTCP which
    reports whether MPTCP[1] is supported on the current platform.
    
    Only Linux is supported here.
    
    The check on Linux is performed once by attemting to create an MPTCP
    socket and look at the returned error:
    
    - If the protocol is not supported, EINVAL (kernel < 5.6) or
      EPROTONOSUPPORT (kernel >= 5.6) is returned and there is no point to
      try again.
    
    - Other errors can be returned:
      - ENOPROTOOPT: the sysctl knob net.mptcp.enabled is set to 0
      - Unpredictable ones: if MPTCP is blocked using SELinux, eBPF, etc.
    
    These other errors are due to modifications that can be reverted during
    the session: MPTCP can be available again later. In this case, it is
    fine to always try to create an MPTCP socket and fallback to TCP in case
    of error.
