    cmd/compile: separate type and expression switch typechecking
    
    While superficially type and expression switch handling seem similar
    and that it would be worthwhile to unify typechecking them, it turns
    out they're actually different enough that separately handling them is
    fewer lines of code and easier to understand as well.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
