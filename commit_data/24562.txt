    fmt: Add support for capital '%X' format verb for scanning
    
    For printing, the format verb '%X' results in a capitalized
    hex-representation of the formatted value. Conversely, using
    '%X' in a Scanf function should scan a hex-representation
    into the given interface{}. The existing implementation
    however only supports '%X' for scanning hex values into
    integers; strings or byte slices remain empty. On the other
    hand, lower-case '%x' supports strings and byte slices just
    fine. This is merely an oversight, which this commit fixes.
    (Additional tests also included.)
    
        Fixes #12940
