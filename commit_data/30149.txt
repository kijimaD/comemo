    os: consider only files from #M as regular on Plan 9
    
    TestRemoveDevNull was added in CL 31657. However, this test
    was failing on Plan 9, because /dev/null was considered as
    a regular file.
    
    On Plan 9, there is no special mode to distinguish between
    device files and regular files.
    
    However, files are served by different servers. For example,
    /dev/null is served by #c (devcons), while /bin/cat is served
    by #M (devmnt).
    
    We chose to consider only the files served by #M as regular
    files. All files served by different servers will be considered
    as device files.
    
    Fixes #17598.
