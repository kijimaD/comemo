    cmd/go: do not turn list ./nonexist into a network lookup
    
    If you're in a directory corresponding to x/y
    and you run go list ./z, we do at some point
    want to turn that into x/y/z. But if ./z does
    not exist that will make the go command
    check the network to see if it can find x/y/z.
    That's clearly wrong: ./z means that directory,
    nothing else. And it turns a typo into a long delay,
    which is even worse.
    
    Fixes #26874.
