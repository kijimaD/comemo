    archive/tar: populate uname/gname/devmajor/devminor in FileInfoHeader
    
    We take a best-effort approach since information for these fields
    are not well supported on all platforms.
    
    user.LookupId+user.LookupGroupId is currently 15x slower than os.Stat.
    For performance reasons, we perpetually cache username and groupname
    with a sync.Map. As a result, this function will not be updated whenever
    the user or group names are renamed in the OS. However, this is a better
    situation than before, where those fields were not populated at all.
