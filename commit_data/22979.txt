    cmd/go: "go get" don't ignore git default branch
    
    Any Git branch can be the default branch not only master. Removing
    hardwired 'checkout master', and using 'checkout {tag}' is the best
    choice. It works with and without a master branch. Furthermore it
    resolves the Github default branch issue. Changing Github default
    branch is effectively changing HEAD.
    
    Fixes #9032
