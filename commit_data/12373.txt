    crypto/x509: enforce path length constraint.
    
    An X.509 path length constrains the number of certificate that may
    follow in the chain. This is a little simplistic for a first pass as it
    doesn't check self-signed certificates (which don't count towards the
    length), but it's conservatively simplistic.
