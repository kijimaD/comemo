    encoding/json: document what unmarshal of `null` into non-reference type does
    
    Originally it was an error, which made perfect sense, but in issue 2540
    I got talked out of this sensible behavior. I'm not thrilled with the "new"
    behavior but it's been there since Go 1.1 so we're stuck with it now.
    
    Fixes #6724.
