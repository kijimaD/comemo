    cmd/go: fix go generate docs
    
    The docs were never updated for the change to the placement
    of the DO NOT EDIT line.
    
    Also, the description of the DO NOT EDIT line interrupted the
    description of the //go:generate line, which made for some
    confusing references in the text that followed. Move it lower.
    
    Fixes #41196.
