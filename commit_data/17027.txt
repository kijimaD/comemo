    runtime: use gcpc/gcsp during traceback of goroutines in syscalls
    gcpc/gcsp are used by GC in similar situation.
    gcpc/gcsp are also more stable than gp->sched,
    because gp->sched is mutated by entersyscall/exitsyscall
    in morestack and mcall. So it has higher chances of being inconsistent.
    Also, rename gcpc/gcsp to syscallpc/syscallsp.
