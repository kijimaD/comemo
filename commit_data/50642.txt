    runtime: clear upper half of sec in ARM walltime
    
    https://golang.org/cl/246763 accidentally changed this to assign the old
    value of vdsoPC to the upper half of sec as that is the last value in
    R1.
    
    The old value of vdsoPC is usually zero, so this typically works.
    However, the reentrant case will have a non-zero value, resulting in a
    bogus returned time. I am unsure if walltime is reachable from a signal
    handler, so this may never occur.
