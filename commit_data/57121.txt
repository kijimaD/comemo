    cmd/{go,cover}: enable response file args for cmd/cover
    
    Change the cover command to accept arguments via response files, using
    the same mechanism employed for the compiler and the assembler. This
    is needed now that the cover tool accepts a list of all source files
    in a package, as opposed to just a single source file, and as a result
    can run into system-dependent command line length limits.
    
    Fixes #60785.
