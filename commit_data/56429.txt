    test: add memcombine testcases for ppc64
    
    Thanks to the recent addition of the memcombine pass, the
    ppc64 ports now have the memcombine optimizations. Previously
    in PPC64.rules, the memcombine rules were only added for
    ppc64le targets due to the significant increase in size of
    the rewritePPC64.go file when those rules were added. The
    ppc64 and ppc64le rules had to be different because of the
    byte order due to endianness differences.
    
    This enables the memcombine tests to be run on ppc64 as well
    as ppc64le.
