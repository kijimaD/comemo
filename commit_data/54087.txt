    runtime/pprof: force use of 4-column profiles in pprof memprofile output
    
    Pprof's converter from legacy text format to protobuf format
    assumes that if the alloc and inuse stats are equal, then what's
    really going on is that the program makes no distinction, and it
    reads them as a two-column profile: objects and bytes.
    
    Most of the time, some sampled object has been freed, and alloc != inuse.
    In that case, pprof reads the profile as a four-column profile, with
    alloc_objects, alloc_bytes, inuse_objects, inuse_bytes.
    
    The 2-column form causes problems in a few ways. One is that if
    you are reading the proto form and expect samples with the 4-column
    names, they're not there. Another is that pprof's profile merger insists
    on having the same number of columns and same names. This means
    that
    
            pprof *.memprofile
    
    works most of the time but fails if one of the memory profiles hit
    the unlikely condition that alloc == inuse, since now its converted
    form differs from the others.
    
    Most programs should simply not be using this output form at all,
    but cmd/compile and cmd/link still do, because x/tools/cmd/compilebench
    reads some extra values from the text form that we have not yet added
    to the proto form.
    
    For the programs still writing this form, the easiest way to avoid the
    column collapse issues is to ensure that the header never reports
    alloc == inuse. The actual values in the header are ignored by pprof now,
    except for the equality check (they should sum to the other values in the
    file, so they are technically redundant). Because the actual values are not
    used except for the equality check, we could hard-code different values
    like 0 and 1, but just in case, to break as little as possible, this CL only
    adjusts the values when they would otherwise be equal. In that case it
    adds 1 to allocBytes. For most profiles, where alloc != inuse already, there
    is no effect at all.
