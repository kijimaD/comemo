    runtime/pprof: increase contention upper bound in TestMutexProfile
    
    Currently TestMutexProfile expects contention to reported as somewhere
    between 0.9x and 2.0x the expected amount introduced. While bounding
    from below is fine (especially since the goroutine holding the mutex
    doesn't even start to sleep until the required number of goroutines are
    blocked on a mutex), bounding from above can easily lead to flakiness.
    Delays and non-determinism can come from anywhere in the system,
    and nevertheless clocks keep ticking. The result is that goroutines
    could easily appear to be blocked on a mutex much longer than just the
    sleep time.
    
    However, the contention upper bound is still useful, especially for
    identifying wildly incorrect values. Set the contention total to be
    proportional to the total wall-time spent in the actual sampling mutex
    block sampling portion of the code. This should be a generous
    upper-bound on how much contention there could be, because it should in
    theory capture any delays from the environment in it as well.
    
    Still, rounding errors could be an issue, and on Windows the time
    granularity is quite low (~15ms, or 15% of what each goroutine is
    supposed to add to the mutex profile), so getting unlucky with where
    time measurements fall within each tick could also be a problem. Add an
    extra 10%, which seems to make it much less likely to fail in a Windows
    gomote.
    
    Fixes #62094.
