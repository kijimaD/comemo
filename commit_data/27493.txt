    encoding/json: rename Indent method to SetIndent
    
    CL 21057 added this method during the Go 1.7 cycle
    (so it is not yet released and still possible to revise).
    
    This makes it clearer that the method is not doing something
    (like func Indent does), but just changing a setting about doing
    something later.
    
    Also document that this is in some sense irreversible.
    I think that's probably a mistake but the original CL discussion
    claimed it as a feature, so I'll leave it alone.
    
    For #6492.
