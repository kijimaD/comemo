    cmd/go/internal/modload: query correct "latest" version through proxy
    
    This fixes a regression introduced in CL 180337. When we query a
    module at "latest" that has no tagged versions, we tried to use ""
    as the version because we used info.Name instead of info.Version. This
    only happened when using a proxy: in direct mode, info.Name is set to
    the underlying VCS revision, which is fine.
    
    Also: serve "/mod/path/@latest" through our test proxy.
    Previously, we served a 404, which made this bug hard to detect.
    
    Fixes #32636
