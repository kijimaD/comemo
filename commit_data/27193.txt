    cmd/link: fix -no-pie / -race check
    
    golang.org/cl/22453 was supposed to pass -no-pie to the linker when linking a
    race-enabled binary if the host toolchain supports it. But I bungled the
    supported check as I forgot to pass -c to the host compiler so it tried to
    compile a 0 byte .c file into an executable, which will never work. Fix it to
    pass -c as it should have all along.
