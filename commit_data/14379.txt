    crypto/x509: implement EncryptPEMBlock
    
    Arbitrary decisions: order of the arguments and the
    fact it takes a block-type argument (rather than
    leaving to user to fill it in later); I'm happy whatever
    colour we want to paint it.
    
    We also change DecryptPEMBlock so that it won't
    panic when the IV has the wrong size.
