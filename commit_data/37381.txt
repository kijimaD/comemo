    doc: explain minor change to gofmt in go1.11
    
    Add the tools section with a Gofmt sub-section, just like in
    go1.10.html. Instead of copying the two last paragraphs from 1.10, which
    warn users about the hidden complexity of enforcing gofmt, move that to
    go/format and link to it.
    
    While at it, remove a duplicate "Tools" header that was likely added by
    accident.
    
    Fixes #26228.

+  One minor detail of the default formatting of Go source code has changed.
+  When formatting expression lists with inline comments, the comments were
+  aligned according to a heuristic.
+  However, in some cases the alignment would be split up too easily, or
+  introduce too much whitespace.
+  The heuristic has been changed to behave better for human-written code.

+  Note that these kinds of minor updates to gofmt are expected from time to
+  time.
+  In general, systems that need consistent formatting of Go source code should
+  use a specific version of the <code>gofmt</code> binary.
+  See the <a href="/pkg/go/format/">go/format</a> package godoc for more
+  information.
