    doc: explain minor change to gofmt in go1.11
    
    Add the tools section with a Gofmt sub-section, just like in
    go1.10.html. Instead of copying the two last paragraphs from 1.10, which
    warn users about the hidden complexity of enforcing gofmt, move that to
    go/format and link to it.
    
    While at it, remove a duplicate "Tools" header that was likely added by
    accident.
    
    Fixes #26228.
