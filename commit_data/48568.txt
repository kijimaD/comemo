    runtime: avoid potential hang in TestGdbAutotmpTypes
    
    If a GC related task preempts between hitting the main.main breakpoint
    and stepping, the test program may halt forever waiting on a GC
    operation. This happens if gdb is configured to halt other threads
    while executing a step.
    
    Configure gdb to continue running all threads during a step by
    setting the scheduler-locking option to off.
    
    Fixes #49852
