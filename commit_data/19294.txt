    spec: several clarifications to language on channels
    
    - A channel may be used between any number of goroutines,
      not just two.
    - Replace "passing a value" (which is not further defined)
      by "sending and receiving a value".
    - Made syntax production more symmetric.
    - Talk about unbuffered channels before buffered channels.
    - Clarify what the comma,ok receive values mean (issue 7785).
    
    Not a language change.
    
    Fixes #7785.
