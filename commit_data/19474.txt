    runtime: fix error check in freebsd/386 i386_set_ldt
    
    Update #2675
    
    The code here was using the error check for Linux/386,
    not the one for FreeBSD/386. Most of the time it worked.
    
    Thanks to Neel Natu (FreeBSD developer) for finding this.
    
    The s/JCC/JAE/ a few lines later is a no-op but makes the
    test match the rest of the file. Why we write JAE instead of JCC
    I don't know, but the two are equivalent and the file might
    as well be consistent.
