    goinstall: support building executable commands
    
    This CL gives goinstall the ability to build commands,
    not just packages.
    
    "goinstall foo.googlecode.com/hg/bar" will build the command named
    "bar" and install it to GOBIN. "goinstall ." will use the name of the
    local directory as the command name.
