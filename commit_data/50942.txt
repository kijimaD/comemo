    cmd/link: relocate dwarf examiner helper to separate package
    
    The linker DWARF test includes an "examiner" helper type (with
    associated methods) that is used to help linker DWARF tests read DWARF
    info in a higher level and more structured way than just raw
    debug/dwarf operations. This patch extracts out "examiner" and
    relocates it to a separate package, so that it can be used in other
    package tests as well, if need be.
