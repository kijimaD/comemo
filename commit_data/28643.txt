    spec: ignore struct tags when converting structs
    
    This is a backwards-compatible language change.
    
    Per the proposal (#16085), the rules for conversions are relaxed
    such that struct tags in any of the structs involved in the conversion
    are ignored (recursively).
    
    Because this is loosening the existing rules, code that compiled so
    far will continue to compile.
    
    For #16085.
    Fixes #6858.
