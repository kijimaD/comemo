 In addition to the build flags, the flags handled by 'go test' itself are:
 
-	-c  Compile the test binary to pkg.test but do not run it.
-	    (Where pkg is the last element of the package's import path.)
+	-c

 	-i

+	-o file

 The test binary also accepts flags that control execution of the test; these
 flags are also accessible by 'go test'.  See 'go help testflag' for details.
