    runtime: use explicit NOFRAME on netbsd/amd64
    
    This CL marks some netbsd assembly functions as NOFRAME to avoid
    relying on the implicit amd64 NOFRAME heuristic, where NOSPLIT functions
    without stack were also marked as NOFRAME.
    
    While here, and thanks to CL 466355, `asm_netbsd_amd64.s` can
    be deleted in favor of `asm9_unix2_amd64.s`, which makes better
    use of the frame pointer.
    
    Updates #58378
