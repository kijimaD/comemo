    cmd/internal/obj/loong64: reclassify three-register operation instructions and two-register operation instructions
    
    The instructions belonging to case 32 have the same structure as the
    instructions in case 2.
    
    The instructions in case 33 are actually two-register operation
    instructions. We move their definitions from function oprrr to oprr and
    merge their implementation into case 9.
