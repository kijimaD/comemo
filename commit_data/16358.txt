    crypto/tls: don't send NPN extension if NextProtos is not set.
    
    This isn't clearly a bug on Go's part, but it triggers a bug in Firefox
    which means that crypto/tls and net/http cannot be wired up together
    unless NextProtos includes "http/1.1". When net/http sets up the
    tls.Config, it does this and so works fine. But anyone setting up the
    tls.Config themselves will hit the Firefox bug.
    
    Fixes #5445.
