    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: ensure OffPtr has pointer type
    
    SSA treats SP as constant throughout a function, so as OffPtr [off] SP.
    When the stack moves, spilled OffPtr values become invalid, if they are
    not pointer-typed.
    
    (Currently it is fine because of the optimization rules that folds OffPtr
    into Load/Store. But it'd better be "optimization", not requirement.)
    
    Updates #15365.
