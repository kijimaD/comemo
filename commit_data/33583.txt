    encoding/hex: make Decode, Decoder, DecodeString agree about partial results and errors
    
    CL 70210 added Decoder for #21590, and in doing so it changed
    the existing func Decode to return partial results for decoding errors.
    That seems like a good change to make to Decode, but it was
    untested (except as used by Decoder), inconsistent with DecodeString
    in all error cases, and inconsistent with Decoder in not returning
    partial results for odd-length input strings.
    
    This CL makes Decode, DecodeString, and Decoder all agree about
    the handling of partial results (they are returned) and error
    precedence (the error earliest in the input is reported),
    and it documents and tests this.
