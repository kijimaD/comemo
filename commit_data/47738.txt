    debug/buildinfo: update test for CL 369977
    
    As a side effect of the changes in cmd/go/internal/work in CL 369977,
    binaries built in GOPATH mode now include rudimentary build metadata
    for at least the package path and compiler in use.
    
    That seems like a strict improvement, but the test needs to be updated
    to reflect the newly-available metadata.
