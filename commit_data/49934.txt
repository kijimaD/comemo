    internal/testenv: add a test for the GoTool function
    
    GoTool was added in CL 20967, and revised in CL 21292, for #14901.
    
    I don't fully understand what problem the GoTool function was added to
    solve: the discussion on that issue was pretty sparse, but it seems
    like when we run tests of GOROOT packages they always know their own
    location relative to GOROOT (and thus always know where to find the
    'go' tool).
    
    Lacking that understanding, I don't want to change its behavior, but I
    do at least want to verify that it resolves to the real 'go' tool in
    the common case (running 'go test' on a package in GOROOT/src).
    
    For #50892
    For #50893
    Updates #14901
