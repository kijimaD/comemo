    doc/go1.14: remove TODO about Solaris port
    
    The solaris-amd64-oraclerel builder is passing for the main Go repo
    (on tip and release branches for 1.13 and 1.12), and golang.org/x repos
    (also on tip and release branches for 1.13 and 1.12).
    
    The builder is still maintained as described at
    https://golang.org/issue/15581#issuecomment-550368581.
