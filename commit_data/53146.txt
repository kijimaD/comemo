    runtime: formalize the trace clock
    
    Currently the trace clock is cputicks() with comments sprinkled in
    different places as to which clock to use. Since the execution tracer
    redesign will use a different clock, it seems like a good time to clean
    that up.
    
    Also, rename the start/end timestamps to be more readable (i.e.
    startTime vs. timeStart).
