    cmd/8g: don't call gc.Fatal during initalisation
    
    Fixes #10592
    
    Calling gc.Fatal before gc.Main has been called ends up flushing gc.bstdout before
    it is properly set up. Ideally obj.Bflush would handle this case, but that type
    and its callers are rather convoluted, so take the simpler route and avoid calling
    gc.Fatal altogether.
