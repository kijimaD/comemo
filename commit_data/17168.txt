    net/http: do not send malformed cookie domain attribute
    
    Malformed domain attributes are not sent in a Set-Cookie header.
    Instead the domain attribute is dropped which turns the cookie
    into a host-only cookie. This is much safer than dropping characters
    from domain attribute.
    
    Domain attributes with a leading dot '.' are still allowed, even
    if discouraged by RFC 6265 section 4.1.1.
    
    Fixes #6013
