commit 0f153ec6b47382f4df8f3b62acdee89208d97584
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    build packages in obj/ subdirectory that mimics $GOROOT/pkg.
    for example, if building in src/lib/container,
    objects go in obj/container/, so that 6g -Iobj
    will find "container/vector".
    
    install packages in hierarchy in $GOROOT.
    
    this change only updates gobuild.
    another change will have to update all
    the sources to refer to "container/vector" etc
    and regenerate all the Makefiles.
    
    there are some pretty lame functions here
    (e.g., Mkdir, Remove, the Getenv("PWD"))
    but i will implement better ones in another CL.
