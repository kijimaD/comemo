    runtime: ensure minimum heap distance via heap goal
    
    Currently we ensure a minimum heap distance of 1MB when computing the
    assist ratio. Rather than enforcing this minimum on the heap distance,
    it makes more sense to enforce that the heap goal itself is at least
    1MB over the live heap size at the beginning of GC. Currently the two
    approaches are semantically equivalent, but this will let us switch to
    basing the assist ratio on current heap distance rather than the
    initial heap distance, since we can't enforce this minimum on the
    current heap distance (the GC may never finish because the goal posts
    will always be 1MB away).
