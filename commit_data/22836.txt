    cmd/internal/gc: fix build on big endian systems
    
    The siz argument to both runtime.newproc and runtime.deferproc is
    int32, not uintptr. This problem won't manifest on little-endian
    systems because that stack slot is uintptr sized anyway. However,
    on big-endian systems, it will make a difference.
