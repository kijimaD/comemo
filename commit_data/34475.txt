    net/http: fix minor leak in Header.WriteSubset
    
    Header.WriteSubset uses a sync.Pool but wouldn't Put the sorter back in
    the pool if there was an error writing to the io.Writer
    
    I'm not really sure why the sorter is returned to begin with. The
    comment says "for possible return to headerSorterCache".
    
    This also doesn't address potential panics that might occur, but the
    overhead of doing the Put in a defer would likely be too great.
