    internal/poll: fix race in Close
    
    There is a potential race between a concurrent call to FD.initIO, which
    calls FD.pd.init, and a call to FD.Close, which calls FD.pd.evict.
    
    This is solved by calling FD.initIO in FD.Close, as that will block
    until the concurrent FD.initIO has completed. Note that FD.initIO is
    no-op if first called from here.
    
    The race window is so small that it is not possible to write a test
    that triggers it.
