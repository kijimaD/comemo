    net/http/httputil: make ReverseProxy flush headers on FlushInterval
    
    A regression was introduced in CL 137335 (5440bfc) that caused FlushInterval
    to not be honored until the first Write() call was encountered. This change
    starts the flush timer as part of setting up the maxLatencyWriter.
    
    Fixes #31125
    Fixes #31126
