    misc/cgo/test: fix vet error
    
    Vet's cgocall check fails on misc/cgo/test with "possibly passing Go
    type with embedded pointer to C". This error is confusing, but the
    cgocall check is looking for passing pointers to Go slices to C, which
    is exactly what this test is doing. Normally we don't notice this
    because vet doesn't run on misc, but we're about to move this test to
    cmd/cgo/internal, where vet will start failing.
    
    I'm not sure why we're passing a pointer to a slice here. It's
    important that we call a C function with an unsafe.Pointer to memory
    containing a pointer to test #25941 and that the result is this call
    is then passed to another C function for #28540. This CL maintains
    these two properties without the use of a slice.
    
    For #37486.
