    cmd/go: require -buildmode=c-shared to take one main package
    
    The current behavior is to filter out the non-main packages silently,
    which is confusing if there are only non-main packages.
    Instead, report an error unless it's used with a single main package.
    
    To be clear, I don't really know what I'm doing.
    It might be that multiple main packages are allowed, or even
    that we do want the filtering, but all.bash passes with this change,
    so I am taking that as a sign that we don't need that extra flexibility.
    
    Fixes #15082.
