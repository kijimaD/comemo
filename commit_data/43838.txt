    cmd/go/internal/work: avoid modload.Selected in 'go install pkg@version'
    
    At this point in installOutsideModule the build list is empty, so
    Selected trivially returns "none" for all modules.
    
    (This change could have been made in CL 266657, but it was a bit
    simpler to update the QueryPattern call sites mechanically to ensure
    that there would be no unintentional semantic drift.)
    
    For #36460
