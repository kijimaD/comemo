    runtime: fix mkasmh.h
    
    We weren't properly deleting the various header
    files (that were temporarily renamed) if a $CC
    for the current $GOARCH didn't exist.  And since
    the compiler checks the current directory for
    headers before any -I arguments, this had the
    unfortunate side effect of including the last
    generated headers instead of the correct ones.
