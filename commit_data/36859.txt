    text/tabwriter: fix BenchmarkPyramid and BenchmarkRagged again
    
    These were added in CL 106979. I got them wrong.
    They were fixed in CL 111643. They were still wrong.
    Hopefully this change will be the last fix.
    
    With this fix, CL 106979 is allocation-neutral for BenchmarkRagged.
    The performance results for BenchmarkPyramid reported in CL 111643 stand.
