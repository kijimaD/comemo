    misc/dist: support building statically linked toolchain.
    so that we don't need worry about specifying the required
    libc version (note: as cmd/go will still be dynamically
    linked to libc, we still need to perform the build on OSes
    with an old enough libc. But as cmd/go doesn't rely on many
    libc symbols, the situation should be significantly better).
    
    Fixes #3564.
