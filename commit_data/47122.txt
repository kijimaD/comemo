    runtime: add testing framework and basic tests for GC pacer
    
    This change creates a formal exported interface for the GC pacer and
    creates tests for it that simulate some series of GC cycles. The tests
    are completely driven by the real pacer implementation, except for
    assists, which are idealized (though revise is called repeatedly).
    
    For #44167.
