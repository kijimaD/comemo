    5g: alignment fixes
    
    Makes all.bash work after echo 4 >/proc/cpu/alignment,
    which means kill the process on an unaligned access.
    
    The default behavior on DreamPlug/GuruPlug/SheevaPlug
    is to simulate an ARMv3 and just let the unaligned accesses
    stop at the word boundary, resulting in all kinds of surprises.
    
    Fixes #1240.
