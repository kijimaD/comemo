    encoding/gob: make x509.Certificate marshalable again
    
    The OID type is not exported data like most of the other x509 structs.
    Using it in x509.Certificate made Certificate not gob-compatible anymore,
    which breaks real-world code. As a temporary fix, make gob ignore
    that field, making it work as well as it did in Go 1.21.
    
    For Go 1.23, we anticipate adding a proper fix and removing the gob
    workaround. See #65633 and #66249 for more details.
    
    For #66249.
    Fixes #65633.
