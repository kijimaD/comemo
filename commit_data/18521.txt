    cmd/gc: correct liveness for func ending in panic
    
    The registerization code needs the function to end in a RET,
    even if that RET is actually unreachable.
    
    The liveness code needs to avoid such unreachable RETs.
    It had a special case for final RET after JMP, but no case
    for final RET after UNDEF. Instead of expanding the special
    cases, let fixjmp - which already knows what is and is not
    reachable definitively - mark the unreachable RET so that
    the liveness code can identify it.
