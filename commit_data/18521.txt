    cmd/gc: correct liveness for various non-returning functions
    
    When the liveness code doesn't know a function doesn't return
    (but the generated code understands that), the liveness analysis
    invents a control flow edge that is not really there, which can cause
    variables to seem spuriously live. This is particularly bad when the
    variables are uninitialized.
