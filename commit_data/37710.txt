    cmd/compile: display Go code for a function in ssa.html
    
    This CL adds the "sources" column at the beginning of SSA table.
    This column displays the source code for the function being passed
    in the GOSSAFUNC env variable.
    
    Also UI was extended so that clicking on particular line will
    highlight all places this line is referenced.
    
    JS code was cleaned and formatted.
    
    This CL does not handle inlined functions. See issue 25904.
