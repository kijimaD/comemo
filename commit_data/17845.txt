    debug/dwarf: add DWARF 4 form constants
    
    Some versions of clang generate DWARF 4-format attributes
    even when using -gdwarf-2. We don't care much about the
    values, but we do need to be able to parse past them.
    
    This fixes a bug in Go 1.2 rc2 reported via private mail using
    a near-tip version of clang.
