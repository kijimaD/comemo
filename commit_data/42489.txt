    cmd/go: remove a bogus assertion in mod_convert_dep
    
    The removed line assumed that the script's WORK directory is not a
    child of any directory containing version-control metadata.
    While that assumption does hold in most cases, it does not hold when,
    for example, $TMPDIR is $HOME/tmp and $HOME/.git/config exists.
    
    A similar situation may or may not arise when using
    golang.org/x/build/cmd/release. Either way, the assertion is incorrect
    and was interfering with local testing for #39385.
    
    Updates #39385
    Fixes #39431
