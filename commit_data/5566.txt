commit 63f014910daab38faee6208de2cbdbc191985d8c
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri May 28 14:17:30 2010 -0700

    go spec: change def. of "type compatibility" to be non-recursive
    and adjust conversion rules.
    
    Also:
    - clarification of type identity (no language change)
    - adjust special rules for channel assignment/comparison to
      require identical element types (in correspondence to non-
      recursiveness of type compatibility)
