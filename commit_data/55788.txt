    cmd/link: store COFF symbol complex type in the LSB instead of the MSB
    
    Microsoft's PE documentation is contradictory. It says that the
    symbol's complex type [1] is stored in the pesym.Type most significant
    byte (MSB), but MSVC, LLVM, and mingw store it in the 4 high bits of
    the less significant byte (LSB). dumpbin understands both encoding.
    
    Previous to CL 475355 the Go compiler mixed MSB and LSB encoding.
    CL 475355 updated to compiler to use the MSB, but this causes problems
    with mingw, which emits a warning when MSB is used.
    
    For reference, LLVM also hit this issue long time ago:
