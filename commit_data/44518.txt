    [dev.link] cmd/internal/obj: trim trailing zeros for content hashing
    
    The symbol's data in the object file (sym.P) may already not
    contain trailing zeros (e,g, for [10]int{1}), but sometimes it
    does (e.g. for [10]int{1,0}). The linker can already handle this
    case. We just always trim the trailing zeros for content hashing,
    so it can deduplicate [10]int{1} and [10]int{1,0}.
    
    Note: in theory we could just trim the zeros in the symbol data
    as well. But currently the linker depends on reading symbol data
    for certain symbols (e.g. type symbol decoding), and trimming
    will complicates things in the linker.
