    cmd/compile: remove "special return in disguise" case
    
    ascompatee does not generate 'x = x' during return, so we don't have to
    check for samelist and disguising special return anymore.
    
    While at it, also remove samelist, as this is the only place it's used.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
