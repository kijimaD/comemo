    os: make RemoveAll("") fail silently on unix
    
    CL 146020 changed the behavior of RemoveAll("") on unix systems using
    the *at functions to return syscall.EINVAL instead of nil. Adjust the
    *at implementation to retain this behavior as is the case on the *noat
    systems.
    
    Additionally, also make sure RemoveAll("") on systems not using the "at
    functions (e.g. nacl and js/wasm) follow the same behavior (which wasn't
    the case previously).
    
    Fixes #28830
