    cmd/go: look for "unknown" when checking supported compiler flags
    
    Where GCC says "unrecognized command line option", clang says "unknown
    argument". This distinction usually doesn't matter because the
    compiler will also exit with a non-zero status, but clang 3.4
    reportedly exits with a zero status after reporting an unknown argument.
