    runtime: make gcDrainN in terms of scan work
    
    Currently, the "n" in gcDrainN is in terms of objects to scan. This is
    used by gchelpwork to perform a limited amount of work on allocation,
    but is a pretty arbitrary way to bound this amount of work since the
    number of objects has little relation to how long they take to scan.
    
    Modify gcDrainN to perform a fixed amount of scan work instead. For
    now, gchelpwork still performs a fairly arbitrary amount of scan work,
    but at least this is much more closely related to how long the work
    will take. Shortly, we'll use this to precisely control the scan work
    performed by mutator assists during allocation to achieve the heap
    size goal.
