    runtime: don't use /dev/random on Plan 9
    
    Plan 9 provides a /dev/random device to return a
    stream of random numbers. However, the method used
    to generate random numbers on Plan 9 is slow and
    reading from /dev/random may block.
    
    We don't want our Go programs to be significantly
    slowed down just to slightly improve the distribution
    of hash values.
    
    So, we do the same thing as NaCl and rely exclusively
    on extendRandom to generate pseudo-random numbers.
    
    Fixes #10028.
