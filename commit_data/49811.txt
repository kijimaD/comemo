    runtime: ensure that we don't scan noscan objects
    
    We claim to not maintain pointer bits for noscan objects. But in fact
    we do, since whenever we switch a page from scannable to noscan, we
    call heapBits.initSpan which zeroes the heap bits.
    
    Switch to ensure that we never scan noscan objects. This ensures that
    we don't depend on the ptrbits for noscan objects. That fixes a bug
    in the 1-bit bitmap CL which depended on that fact.
