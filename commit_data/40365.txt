    cmd/compile: don't use FMA on plan9
    
    CL 137156 introduces an intrinsic on AMD64 that executes vfmadd231sd
    when feature detection is successful. However, because floating-point
    isn't allowed in note handler, the builder disables SSE instructions,
    and fails when attempting to execute this instruction. This change
    disables FMA on plan9 to immediately use the software fallback.
    
    Fixes #35063.
