    cmd/go/internal/mvs: reverse the order of BuildListError.stack
    
    When we print the stack from a BuildListError, we print the main
    module first and the error last. That was the opposite of the order in
    which in was stored in memory, leading to (arguably) more complex code
    and (definitely) my own inability to reason about the contents of the
    slice.
    
    For now, it's still more convenient to construct the stack reversed,
    so we do that and then reverse it before packing it into the error.
    
    For #36460
