commit 3d42e691b931d34f2a3fee0885368f42d84665fb
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    make 6l produce dynamically linked binaries (although they are fully statically linked as far
    as go is concerned).  the -d flag is now flipped; as on the mac, -d disables dynamic.
    
    much remains to be improved to move the output closer to the gcc format.
