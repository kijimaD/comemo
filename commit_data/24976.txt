    runtime: reduce pthread stack size in TestCgoCallbackGC
    
    Fixes #11959
    
    This test runs 100 concurrent callbacks from C to Go consuming 100
    operating system threads, which at 8mb a piece (the default on linux/arm)
    would reserve over 800mb of address space. This would frequently
    cause the test to fail on platforms with ~1gb of ram, such as the
    raspberry pi.
    
    This change reduces the thread stack allocation to 256kb, a number picked
    at random, but at 1/32th the previous size, should allow the test to
    pass successfully on all platforms.
