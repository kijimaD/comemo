    net/http: remove arbitrary timeout in TestServerHijackGetsBackgroundByte_big
    
    This test fails with "timeout" once per couple of months.
    It may be that the arbitrary timeout is too short,
    or it may be that the test is detecting a real bug
    (perhaps a deadlock) and reporting it without sufficient
    information to debug.
    
    Either way, the arbitrary timeout is doing only harm:
    either it is too short, or it is preventing us from getting
    a useful goroutine dump when the test inevitably times out.
    
    Fixes #35498 (hopefully).
