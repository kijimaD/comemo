    log/syslog: add stub for Plan 9
    
    Proper local system log semantics still need to be
    created for Plan 9. In the meantime, the test suite
    (viz., exp/gotype) expects there to be some Go
    source for each import path. Thus, here is a stub,
    equivalent to syslog_windows, for this purpose.
