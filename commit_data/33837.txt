    crypto/elliptic: fix incomplete addition used in CombinedMult.
    
    The optimised P-256 includes a CombinedMult function, which doesn't do
    dual-scalar multiplication, but does avoid an affine conversion for
    ECDSA verification.
    
    However, it currently uses an assembly point addition function that
    doesn't handle exceptional cases.
    
    Fixes #20215.
