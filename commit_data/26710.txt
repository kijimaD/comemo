    net/http: zero pad Response status codes to three digits
    
    Go 1.6's HTTP/1.x Transport started enforcing that responses have 3
    status digits, per the spec, but we could still write out invalid
    status codes ourselves if the called
    ResponseWriter.WriteHeader(0). That is bogus anyway, since the minimum
    status code is 1xx, but be a little bit less bogus (and consistent)
    and zero pad our responses.
