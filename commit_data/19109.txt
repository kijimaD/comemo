    net/http: don't reject 0-lengthed bodies with Expect 100-continue
    
    I was implementing rules from RFC 2616. The rules are apparently useless,
    ambiguous, and too strict for common software on the Internet. (e.g. curl)
    
    Add more tests, including a test of a chunked request.
    
    Fixes #7625
