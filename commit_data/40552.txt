    runtime: don't async preempt NO_LOCAL_POINTERS assembly functions
    
    We don't async preempt assembly functions. We do that by checking
    whether the function has a local pointer map, and assume it is
    an assembly (or, non-Go) function if there isn't one. However,
    assembly functions marked with NO_LOCAL_POINTERS still have local
    pointer maps, and we wouldn't identify them. For them, check for
    the special pointer map runtime.no_pointers_stackmap as well, and
    treat them as not async preemptible.
