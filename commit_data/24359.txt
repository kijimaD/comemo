    cmd/go: mention go tool compile etc. in the help text for build
    
    Not everyone is aware that go build is a wrapper for other
    tools. Mention this in the text for go help build so people using
    other build systems won't just wrap go build, which is usually a
    mistake (it doesn't do incremental builds by default, for instance).
    
    Update #11854.
