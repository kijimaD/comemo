    encoding/binary: give LittleEndian, BigEndian specific types
    
    Giving them specific types has the benefit that
    binary.BigEndian.Uint32(b) is now a direct call, not an
    indirect via a mutable interface value, so it can potentially
    be inlined.
    
    Recent changes to the spec relaxed the rules for comparison,
    so this code is still valid:
    
            func isLittle(o binary.ByteOrder) { return o == binary.LittleEndian }
    
    The change does break this potential idiom:
    
            o := binary.BigEndian
            if foo {
                    o = binary.LittleEndian
            }
    
    That must rewrite to give o an explicit binary.ByteOrder type.
    On balance I think the benefit from the direct call and inlining
    outweigh the cost of breaking that idiom.
