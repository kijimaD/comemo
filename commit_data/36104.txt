    cmd/trace: avoid emitting traceview slice with 0 duration
    
    The trace viewer interprets the slice as a non-terminating
    time interval which is quite opposit to what trace records indicate
    (i.e., almostly immediately terminating time interval).
    As observed in the issue #24663 this can result in quite misleading
    visualization of the trace.
    
    Work around the trace viewer's issue by setting a small value
    (0.0001usec) as the duration if the time interval is not positive.
