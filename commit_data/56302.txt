    cmd/link/internal/ld: revised bindnow/relro test for ELF
    
    This patch re-enables the portion of the TestElfBindNow test that
    verifies that selected sections are in a read-only segment. Turns out
    we can't always check for read-only ".got" on all architectures (on
    ppc64le for example ".got" will only turn up if there is CGO use), so
    always look for readonly ".dynamic", but only look for readonly ".got"
    if the section is present.
    
    Updates #45681.
