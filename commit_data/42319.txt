    encoding/asn1: sort order of 'SET of' components during Marshal
    
    Per X690 Section 11.6 sort the order of SET of components when generating
    DER. This CL makes no changes to Unmarshal, meaning unordered components
    will still be accepted, and won't be re-ordered during parsing.
    
    In order to sort the components a new encoder, setEncoder, which is similar
    to multiEncoder is added. The functional difference is that setEncoder
    encodes each component to a [][]byte, sorts the slice using a sort.Sort
    interface, and then writes it out to the destination slice. The ordering
    matches the output of OpenSSL.
    
    Fixes #24254
