commit 5e47b779905ce87faac1bea3b0774b50ddf1ceba

    exp/locale/collate/tools/colcmp: implementation of colcmp tool used for comparing
    various implementation of collation.  The tool provides commands for soring,
    regressing one implementation against another, and benchmarking.
    Currently it includes collation implementations for the Go collator, ICU,
    and one using Darwin's CoreFoundation framework.
    To avoid building this tool in the default build, the colcmp tag has been
    added to all files. This allows other tools/colcmp in this directory (e.g. it may make
    sense to move maketables here) to be put in this directory as well.
