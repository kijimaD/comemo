    hash/maphash: add Bytes and String
    
    For very small inputs, h.Reset+h.Write+h.Sum64 is fundamentally
    slower than a single operation, by about a factor of two, because
    Write must copy the data into h's buffer, just in case there is another
    Write before the Sum64.
    
    A single function doing the whole sequence knows there is no extra
    write that will happen, so it doesn't need the buffer, so it avoids the copy.
    
    Fixes #42710.
