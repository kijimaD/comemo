    cmd/compile: use staticuint64s instead of staticbytes
    
    There are still two places in src/runtime/string.go that use
    staticbytes, so we cannot delete it just yet.
    
    There is a new codegen test to verify that the index calculation
    is constant-folded, at least on amd64. ppc64, mips[64] and s390x
    cannot currently do that.
    
    There is also a new runtime benchmark to ensure that this does not
    slow down performance (tested against parent commit):
    
    name                      old time/op  new time/op  delta
    ConvT2EByteSized/bool-4   1.07ns ± 1%  1.07ns ± 1%   ~     (p=0.060 n=14+15)
    ConvT2EByteSized/uint8-4  1.06ns ± 1%  1.07ns ± 1%   ~     (p=0.095 n=14+15)
