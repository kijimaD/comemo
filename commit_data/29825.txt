    cmd/pprof: search for sample types in profile
    
    Search the sample types in the profile being processed to map
    sample type options to indices in the profile sample type array.
    
    Previously these were hardcoded, which caused issues when the
    sample types for a profile type changed. For instance, this was
    triggered by the native generation of profiles in profile.proto
    format.
    
    This fixes #18230. A similar mechanism already exists on the upstream
    pprof.
