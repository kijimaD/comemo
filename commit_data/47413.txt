    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of call.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/call.go
    and call.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker, renaming of
    sig_params to sigParams, and a couple of comment adjustments.
    These additional changes reduce the difference between this
    file and the go/types version.
    
    Note that the verification pass using a MethodSet doesn't
    exist because there's no MethodSet in types2.
