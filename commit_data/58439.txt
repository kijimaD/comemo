    cmd/go: allow toolchain upgrades in 'go mod download' when we would already allow go.mod updates
    
    This fixes an inconsistency that was introduced in CL 537480 and noted
    in the review on CL 539697.
    
    In particular, 'go mod download' already updates the go.mod file when
    other kinds of updates are needed. (#45551 suggested that it should
    not do so, but that part of the change was not implemented yet;
    finishing that change is proposed as #64008.)
    
    Updates #62054.
