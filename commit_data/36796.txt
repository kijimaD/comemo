    misc/wasm: add mention of polyfill for Edge support
    
    Edge supports WebAssembly but not TextEncoder or TextDecoder.
    This change adds a comment pointing to a polyfill that could
    be used. The polyfill is not added by default, because we want to
    let the user decide if/how to include the polyfill.
    
    Fixes #27295
