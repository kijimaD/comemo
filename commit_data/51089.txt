+
+### What is the path of the package that you would like to have removed?
+
+<!---
+We can remove packages with a shared path prefix.
+For example, a request for "github.com/author" would remove all pkg.go.dev pages with that package path prefix.
+--->
+
+
+
+### Are you the owner of this package?
+
+<!---
+Only the package owners can request to have their packages removed from pkg.go.dev.
+--->
+
+
+
+### What is the reason that you could not retract this package instead?
+
+<!---
+If you would like to have your module removed from pkg.go.dev, we recommend that you retract them, so that they can be removed from the go command and proxy.golang.org as well.
+
+Retracting a module version involves adding a retract directive to your go.mod file and publishing a new version. For example: https://github.com/jba/retract-demo/blob/main/go.mod#L5-L8
+
+See https://pkg.go.dev/about#removing-a-package for additional tips on retractions.

+### Author background
+
+- **Would you consider yourself a novice, intermediate, or experienced Go programmer?**
+- **What other languages do you have experience with?**
+
+### Related proposals
+
+- **Has this idea, or one like it, been proposed before?**
+  - **If so, how does this proposal differ?**
+- **Does this affect error handling?**
+  - **If so, how does this differ from previous error handling proposals?**
+- **Is this about generics?**
+  - **If so, how does this relate to the accepted design and other generics proposals?**
+
+### Proposal
+
+- **What is the proposed change?**
+- **Who does this proposal help, and why?**
+- **Please describe as precisely as possible the change to the language.**
+- **What would change in the language spec?**
+- **Please also describe the change informally, as in a class teaching Go.**
+- **Is this change backward compatible?**
+  - Breaking the Go 1 compatibility guarantee is a large cost and requires a large benefit.
+    Show example code before and after the change.
+  - **Before**
+  - **After**
+- **Orthogonality: how does this change interact or overlap with existing features?**
+- **Is the goal of this change a performance improvement?**
+  - **If so, what quantifiable improvement should we expect?**
+  - **How would we measure it?**
+
+### Costs
+
+- **Would this change make Go easier or harder to learn, and why?**
+- **What is the cost of this proposal? (Every language change has a cost).**
+- **How many tools (such as vet, gopls, gofmt, goimports, etc.) would be affected?**
+- **What is the compile time cost?**
+- **What is the run time cost?**
+- **Can you describe a possible implementation?**
+- **Do you have a prototype? (This is not required.)**
