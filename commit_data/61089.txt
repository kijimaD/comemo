    README.vendor: add note about GOROOT, recommend fresh go
    
    Using a different build of Go (specifically, a different GOROOT) to
    maintain the vendor directory doesn't always reproduce the same results.
    This can result in unknowingly creating a vendor directory that isn't
    able to build Go.
    
    Add a note to README.vendor to point this out. Specifically, mention
    that a mismatched GOROOT is an issue, and recommend using a fresh build
    of Go to maintain the vendor directory.
    
    Updates #69235

 Make sure that GO111MODULE is not set in the environment, or that it is
 set to 'on' or 'auto', and if you use a go.work file, set GOWORK=off.
 
+Also, ensure that 'go env GOROOT' shows the root of this Go source

 Requirements may be added, updated, and removed with 'go get'.
 The vendor directory may be updated with 'go mod vendor'.
