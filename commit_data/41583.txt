    [dev.link] cmd/link: on AIX, use relocation to locate target symbol from TOC symbol
    
    On AIX, a TOC symbol always has a relocation to its target symbol.
    Instead of using name lookup to locate the target symbol, we can
    just use the relocation.
    
    Using name lookup, besides being less efficient, needs to provide
    the right symbol version. In this particular case, we are looking
    for a data symbol so it is almost always version 0. But in case
    that it is a text symbol, we may get an ABIALIAS symbol, which
    does not have its Sect set.
