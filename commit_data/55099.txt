    .github: suggest using private browsing in pkgsite template
    
    I opened #54872 without considering my browser's extensions and one of
    them ended up being the cause of my issue. This seems to be a common
    error.
    
    To help that, add a suggestion to use a private/incognito tab/window
    to the pkgsite issue template when reproducing issues. This probably
    would have been enough for me to figure things out before opening my
    issue.
    
    Updates #54872, #47213
