    cmd/pprof: don't use local symbolization for remote source
    
    If we are using a remote source (a URL), and the user did not specify
    the executable file to use, then don't try to use a local source.
    This was misbehaving because the local symbolizer will not fail
    if there is any memory map available, but the presence of a memory map
    does not ensure that the files and symbols are actually available.
    
    We still need a pprof testsuite.
    
    Fixes #16159.
