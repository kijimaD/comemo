    os/exec: constrain thread usage in leaked descriptor test on illumos
    
    On illumos systems, libc can under some conditions make use of files
    from /proc.  In the case of this test, the creation of new threads was
    (in the target thread) causing libc to open and close
    "/proc/self/lwp/5/lwpname" to set the thread name, which raced with the
    leaking descriptor check (see detailed analysis in #42431).
    
    This change requests that the Go runtime use less threads in the child
    process used to check for leaked descriptors, without just disabling the
    test.  After a thousand repeated trials, the test no longer fails on
    illumos.
    
    Fixes #42431.
