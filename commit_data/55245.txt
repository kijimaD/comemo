    go/parser: fix panic in object resolution for invalid type parameter list
    
    This change restores the original logic in parseParameterList to what
    it was before CL 538858 (which caused the issue), not in exact wording
    but in identical semantic meaning, and thus restores this function to
    a state that we know was working fine.
    
    However, the change keeps the improved error reporting introduced by
    CL 538858. To keep the code changes somewhat minimal as we are close
    to RC1, the improved error handling exists twice for now even though
    it could be factored out.
    
    Fixes #64534.
