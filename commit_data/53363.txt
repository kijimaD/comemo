    runtime: add mayAcquire annotation for trace.lock
    
    Now that we've moved the trace locks to the leaf of the lock graph, we
    can safely annotate that any trace event may acquire trace.lock even
    if dynamically it turns out a particular event doesn't need to flush
    and acquire this lock.
    
    This reveals a new edge where we can trace while holding the mheap
    lock, so we add this to the lock graph.
    
    For #53789.
    Updates #53979.
