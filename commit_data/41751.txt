    internal/syscall/windows/registry: fix strict assumptions in TestWalkFullRegistry
    
    It turns out that Windows has "legitimate" keys that have bogus type
    values or bogus lengths that don't correspond with their type. On up to
    date Windows 10 systems, this test always fails for this reason.
    
    So, this commit alters the test to simply log the discrepancy and move
    on.
    
    Fixes #35084
