    runtime: eliminate possible stack movements in ReadMetricsSlow
    
    Currently it's possible (and even probable, with mayMoreStackMove mode)
    for a stack allocation to occur between readmemstats_m and readMetrics
    in ReadMetricsSlow. This can cause tests to fail by producing metrics
    that are inconsistent between the two sources.
    
    Fix this by breaking out the critical section of readMetrics and calling
    that from ReadMetricsSlow on the systemstack. Our main constraint in
    calling readMetrics on the system stack is the fact that we can't
    acquire the metrics semaphore from the system stack. But if we break out
    the critical section, then we can acquire that semaphore before we go on
    the system stack.
    
    While we're here, add another readMetrics call before readmemstats_m.
    Since we're being paranoid about ways that metrics could get skewed
    between the two calls, let's eliminate all uncertainty. It's possible
    for readMetrics to allocate new memory, for example for histograms, and
    fail while it's reading metrics. I believe we're just getting lucky
    today with the order in which the metrics are produced. Another call to
    readMetrics will preallocate this data in the samples slice. One nice
    thing about this second read is that now we effectively have a way to
    check if readMetrics really will allocate if called a second time on the
    same samples slice.
    
    Fixes #60607.
