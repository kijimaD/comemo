    net: don't leave hostsPath unrestored on error in TestLookupStaticHost
    
    If the return was reached, then hostsPath would not be properly restored
    to its original value. See the (lengthy) discussion at
    https://golang.org/cl/15960047/
    
    I assume that this is not for Go 1.2; mailing now since I promised to do so.
    I will plan to ping once Go 1.2 is out.
