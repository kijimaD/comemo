    net/http: clarify client return values in docs
    
    Also, fixes one violation found during testing where both
    response and error could be non-nil when a CheckRedirect test
    failed.  This is arguably a minor API (behavior, not
    signature) change, but it wasn't documented either way and was
    inconsistent & non-Go like.  Any code depending on the old
    behavior was wrong anyway.
