    net/http: fix confusing shadowing in ProxyFromEnvironment
    
    The old code worked, somewhat on accident, but was confusing,
    and had a useless assignment to the inner err. It worked
    because url.Parse parses just about anything, so the outer err
    was always nil, so it always fell through to the bottom return
    statement, even without the "err = nil" line.
    
    Instead, just have two return statements, and add a comment.
