    os/exec: parallelize more tests
    
    This cuts the wall duration for 'go test os/exec' and
    'go test -race os/exec' roughly in half on my machine,
    which is an even more significant speedup with a high '-count'.
    
    For better or for worse, it may also increase the repro rate
    of #34988.
    
    Tests that use Setenv or Chdir or check for FDs opened during the test
    still cannot be parallelized, but they are only a few of those.
