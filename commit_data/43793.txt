    cmd/compile: add Value.Uses comparison during scheduling
    
    Falling back to comparing Value.ID during scheduling
    is undesirable: Not only are we simply hoping for a good
    outcome, but the decision we make will be easily perturbed
    by other compiler changes, leading to random fluctuations.
    
    This change adds another decision point to the scheduler
    by scheduling Values with many uses earlier.
    Values with fewer uses are less likely to be spilled for
    other reasons, so we should issue them as late as possible
    in the hope of avoiding a spill.
    
    This reduces the number of Value ID comparisons
    in schedule while running make.bash
    from 1,000,844 to 542,442.
    
    As you would expect, this changes a lot of functions,
    but the overall trend is positive:
