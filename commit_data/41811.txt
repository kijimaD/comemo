    cmd/compile: combine ssa.html columns with identical contents
    
    Combine columns in ssa.html output if they are identical. There
    can now be multiple titles per column which are all clickable to
    expand and collapse their column. Give collapsed columns some
    padding for better readability. Some of the work in this CL was
    started by Josh Bleecher Snyder and mailed to me in order to
    continue to completion.
