    misc/cgo/test/backdoor: add gccgo version of backdoor function
    
    For the gc compiler the Go function Issue7695 is defined in
    runtime.c, but there is no way to do that for gccgo, because
    there is no way to get the correct pkgpath.  The test is not
    important for gccgo in any case.
