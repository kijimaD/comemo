    net/http: document concurrency expectations for Request.Body
    
    This is primarily aimed at client requests where the user can supply
    their own io.ReadCloser, but also clarifies server request behavior.
    A server request body can be one of:
    
    - *body
    - *http2RequestBody
    - *expectContinueReader
    - *maxBytesReader
    
    Of those, *expectContinueReader did not meet these expectations, so this
    change also removes the data race.
