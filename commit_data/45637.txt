    runtime: default to MADV_DONTNEED on Linux
    
    In Go 1.12, we changed the runtime to use MADV_FREE when available on
    Linux (falling back to MADV_DONTNEED) in CL 135395 to address issue
     #23687. While MADV_FREE is somewhat faster than MADV_DONTNEED, it
    doesn't affect many of the statistics that MADV_DONTNEED does until
    the memory is actually reclaimed under OS memory pressure. This
    generally leads to poor user experience, like confusing stats in top
    and other monitoring tools; and bad integration with management
    systems that respond to memory usage.
    
    We've seen numerous issues about this user experience, including
     #41818, #39295, #37585, #33376, and #30904, many questions on Go
    mailing lists, and requests for mechanisms to change this behavior at
    run-time, such as #40870. There are also issues that may be a result
    of this, but root-causing it can be difficult, such as #41444 and
     #39174. And there's some evidence it may even be incompatible with
    Android's process management in #37569.
    
    This CL changes the default to prefer MADV_DONTNEED over MADV_FREE, to
    favor user-friendliness and minimal surprise over performance. I think
    it's become clear that Linux's implementation of MADV_FREE ultimately
    doesn't meet our needs. We've also made many improvements to the
    scavenger since Go 1.12. In particular, it is now far more prompt and
    it is self-paced, so it will simply trickle memory back to the system
    a little more slowly with this change. This can still be overridden by
    setting GODEBUG=madvdontneed=0.
    
    Fixes #42330 (meta-issue).
    
    Fixes #41818, #39295, #37585, #33376, #30904 (many of which were
    already closed as "working as intended").
