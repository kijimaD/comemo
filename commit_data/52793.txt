    cmd/go: simplify code that still assumed the build cache could be nil
    
    cache.Default always returns a non-nil value since Go 1.12; the docs were
    updated in https://go.dev/cl/465555.
    
    This updates all the callers of cache.Default that were checking whether
    the result was nil so the code isn't misleading/confusing to readers.
