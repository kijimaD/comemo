    crypto/tls: allow larger initial records.
    
    Some servers which misunderstood the point of the CertificateRequest
    message send huge reply records. These records are large enough that
    they were considered “insane” by the TLS code and rejected.
    
    This change removes the sanity test for record lengths. Although the
    maxCiphertext test still remains, just above, which (roughly) enforces
    the 16KB protocol limit on record sizes:
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-6.2.1
    
    Fixes #8928.
