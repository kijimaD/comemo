    x509: add root certs for android.
    
    On android, root certificates appear to be stored in the folder
    /system/etc/security/cacerts, which has many certs in several
    different files. This change adds a new array of directories in
    which certs can be found.
    
    To test this, I simply tried making a request with the http
    library to an HTTPS URL on an android emulator and manually
    verified that it worked.
