    go/types: return an error from Instantiate
    
    This is a port of CL 342152 to go/types. Additionally, a panic was
    removed from interface substitution, which is a fix from CL 333155 that
    was previously missed.
    
    A check for a nil Checker was also removed from types2.instantiate,
    since check must not be nil in that method.
