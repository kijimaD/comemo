    codereview: don't warn about secret commits
    
    Normally the codereview plugin disables adding new commits
    when not using the submit command. Unfortunately this makes
    it impossible to use the Mercurial Queues extension at the
    same time.
    
    A feature called "Phases" was introduced in Mercurial 2.1
    that allows marking commits as being secret; this means
    they will never be pushed to the upstream repository.
    
    We can take advantage of this feature to allow the use of
    Mercurial Queues if the mq.secret option has been set in
    hgrc(5) and a recent version of Mercurial is used.
