    cmd/compile: don't create or instantiate methods on shape types
    
    We should never use or need methods on non-interface shape types. We do
    have corresponding functions instantiated with the appropriate
    shape types that take the dictionary and the shape-based receiver as the
    first two arguments. Each such function has the same name as what the
    corresponding method would be, so it's best not to create the methods
    (which would create confusion for import/export). This fixes issue
    48414, which happened because of the confusion between these two
    functions/methods.
    
    Fixes #48414
