    cmd/go: fix cgo linking on netbsd
    
    NetBSD's built-in linker script for 'ld -r' does not provide a
    SEARCH_DIR. As a result libgcc.a is not found when -lgcc is used.
    
    Work around this by determining the path to libgcc (by invoking
    gcc with the -print-libgcc-file-name option) and explicitly
    referencing the resulting library.
