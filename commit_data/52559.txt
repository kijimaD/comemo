    go/printer: align expression list elements containing tabs
    
    A user noticed that, given the input
    
            {
                    S:       "Hello World",
                    Integer: 42,
            },
            {
                    S:       "      ", // an actual <tab>
                    Integer: 42,
            },
    
    gofmt would incorrectly format the code as
    
            {
                    S:       "Hello World",
                    Integer: 42,
            },
            {
                    S: "    ", // an actual <tab>
                    Integer: 42,
            },
    
    The problem was in the nodeSize method, used to get the printed length
    of a node before it's actually printed to the final buffer.
    The exprList method calls nodeSize to see if one expression in a list
    changes too drastically in size from the previous, which means the
    vertical alignment should be broken.
    
    It is worth noting that nodeSize only reports valid lengths if the node
    fits into a single line; otherwise, it returns a large number, larger
    than an "infinity" currently set to 1e6.
    
    However, the "does it fit in a single line" logic was broken;
    it checked if any of the to-be-printed characters is less than ' ',
    which does include '\n' and '\f' (the latter used by tabwriter as well),
    but also includes '\t', which would make nodeSize incorrectly conclude
    that our key-value expression with a tab does not fit into a single line.
    
    While here, make the testdata test cases run as sub-tests,
    as I used "-run TestRewrite/tabs.input" to help debug this.
    
    Fixes #51910.
