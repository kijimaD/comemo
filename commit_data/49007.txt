    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: handle derived types that are converted to interfaces
    
    Up to this point, we were only handling typeparams that were converted
    to empty or non-empty interfaces. But we have a dictionary entry for
    each derived type (i.e. type derived from typeparams) as well. So, when
    doing a conversion, look for the source type in both the type params and
    derived types of the generic info, and then use the appropriate
    dictionary entry.
    
    Added some cases to ifaceconv.go (e.g. converting []T to an empty
    interface).
