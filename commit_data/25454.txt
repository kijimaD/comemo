    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: default compile+test with SSA
    
    Some tests disabled, some bifurcated into _ssa and not,
    with appropriate logging added to compiler.
    
    "tests/live.go" in particular needs attention.
    
    SSA-specific testing removed, since it's all SSA now.
    
    Added "-run_skips" option to tests/run.go to simplify
    checking whether a test still fails (or how it fails)
    on a skipped platform.
    
    The compiler now compiles with SSA by default.
    If you don't want SSA, specify GOSSAHASH=n (or N) as
    an environment variable.  Function names ending in "_ssa"
    are always SSA-compiled.
    
    GOSSAFUNC=fname retains its "SSA for fname, log to ssa.html"
    GOSSAPKG=pkg only has an effect when GOSSAHASH=n
    GOSSAHASH=10101 etc retains its name-hash-matching behavior
    for purposes of debugging.
    
    See #13068
