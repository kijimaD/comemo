    cmd/dist: use goTest for manual go test invocations
    
    This CL rewrites everywhere in dist that manually constructs an
    exec.Cmd to run "go test" to use the goTest abstraction. All remaining
    invocations of "go test" after this CL construct the command line
    manually, but ultimately use addCmd to execute it.
    
    I traced all exec calls from cmd/dist on linux/amd64 and this makes
    only no-op changes (such as re-arranging the order of flags).
    
    For #37486.
