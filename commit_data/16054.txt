    cmd/gc: preserve safe annotation of package def.
    
    A package file may begin as either "package foo" or
    "package foo safe". The latter is relevant when using -u.
    https://golang.org/cl/6903059 resulted in the distinction
    being dropped when a package was read for the second or later time.
    This CL records whether that "safe" tag was present,
    and includes it in the dummy statement generated for the lexer.
