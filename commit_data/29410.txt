    cmd/link: don't use trampolines in ppc64le ext linking
    
    On ppc64x, trampolines are used to resolve too-far
    branches for internal linking.  The external linking,
    solution on ppc64x is to split text sections when they
    get too large, allowing the external linker to handle
    the long branches.
    
    On arm trampolines are generanted for too-far branches
    for internal and external linking.  When the change
    was made recently to enable trampolines for external linking
    on arm, that broke the ppc64x fix for too-far branches
    with external linking.
    
    The fix adds a check to use trampolines only for internal
    linking with ppc64x.
    
    Fixes #17795
