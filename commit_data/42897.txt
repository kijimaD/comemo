    net/http: reject negative suffix-length Range:bytes=--N with 416 status code
    
    Fixes the file server to reject requests of the form:
        "Range": "bytes=--N"
    where "-N" is a negative suffix-length as designated by the
    grammar in RFC 7233 Section 2.1, "Byte-Ranges", which specifies
    that suffix-length MUST be of the form 1*DIGIT aka a non-negative digit.
    
    Thus requests such as:
        "Range": "bytes=--2"
    will be rejected with a "416 Range Not Satisfiable" response.
    
    Fixes #40940
