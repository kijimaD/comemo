    all: add a few more godoc links
    
    Over the past few months as I read the standard library's documentation
    I kept finding spots where godoc links would have helped me.
    I kept adding to a stash of changes to fix them up bit by bit.
    
    The stash has grown big enough by now, and we're nearing a release,
    so I think it's time to merge to avoid git conflicts or bit rot.
    
    Note that a few sentences are slightly reworded,
    since "implements the Fooer interface" can just be "implements [Fooer]"
    now that the link provides all the context needed to the user.
