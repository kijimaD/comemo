    misc/emacs: allow godef to work in coverage buffers
    
    Jumps to the same file will use the original buffer, not the
    coverage buffer. Making it work for the coverage buffer isn't
    worth the trouble, especially because it would break as soon as
    you jump to a different file and back.
    
    Use error instead of message so it actually terminates
