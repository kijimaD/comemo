    runtime: always clear stack barriers on G exit
    
    Currently the runtime fails to clear a G's stack barriers in gfput if
    the G's stack allocation is _FixedStack bytes. This causes the runtime
    to panic if the following sequence of events happens:
    
    1) The runtime installs stack barriers on a G.
    
    2) The G exits by calling runtime.Goexit. Since this does not
       necessarily return through the stack barriers installed on the G,
       there may still be untriggered stack barriers left on the G's stack
       in recorded in g.stkbar.
    
    3) The runtime calls gfput to add the exiting G to the free pool. If
       the G's stack allocation is _FixedStack bytes, we fail to clear
       g.stkbar.
    
    4) A new G starts and allocates the G that was just added to the free
       pool.
    
    5) The new G begins to execute and overwrites the stack slots that had
       stack barriers in them.
    
    6) The garbage collector enters mark termination, attempts to remove
       stack barriers from the new G, and finds that they've been
       overwritten.
    
    Fix this by clearing the stack barriers in gfput in the case where it
    reuses the stack.
    
    Fixes #11256.
