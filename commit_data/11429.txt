    cmd/go: solve ambiguity of get lp.net/project/foo
    
    This solves the ambiguity for "lp.net/project/foo". In these URLs,
    "foo" could be a series name registered in Launchpad with its own
    branch, and it could also be the name of a directory within the
    main project branch one level up.
    
    Solve it by testing if the series branch exists in Launchpad
    and if it doesn't moving the root one level up.
