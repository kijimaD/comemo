    go/types: avoid certain problems with recursive alias type declarations
    
    It is possible to create certain recursive type declarations involving
    alias types which cause the type-checker to produce an (invalid) type
    for the alias because it is not yet available. By type-checking alias
    declarations in a 2nd phase, the problem is mitigated a bit since it
    requires more convoluted alias declarations for the problem to appear.
    
    Also re-enable testing of fixedbugs/issue27232.go again (which was the
    original cause for this change).
    
    Updates #28576.
