    cmd/compile: mark wrapper functions with DW_AT_trampoline
    
    Change DWARF generation to tag wrapper functions with the
    "DW_AT_trampoline attribute". The intent is that debuggers can pick up
    on this attr so as to skip through the wrapper to the eventual target.
    
    DWARF standard allows for a couple of different possible variants of
    the trampoline attr; this is the simplest variant (all it tells the
    debugger is that the function is a wrapper, doesn't include a
    reference to the wrapper routine).
    
    This implementation keys off the WRAPPER LSym attribute, which is set
    for method wrappers, ABI wrappers, and a selected set of runtime
    assembly routines (ex: "runtime.call32").
