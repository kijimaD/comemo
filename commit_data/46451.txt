    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: fix printing of method expressions
    
    OTYPE and OMETHEXPR were missing from OpPrec. So add them with the
    same precedences as OT{ARRAY,MAP,STRUCT,etc} and
    ODOT{,METH,INTER,etc}, respectively. However, ODEREF (which is also
    used for pointer types *T) has a lower precedence than other types, so
    pointer types need to be specially handled to assign them their
    correct, lower precedence.
    
    Incidentally, this also improves the error messages in issue15055.go,
    where we were adding unnecessary parentheses around the types in
    conversion expressions.
    
    Thanks to Cuong Manh Le for writing the test cases for #43428.
    
    Fixes #43428.
