    cmd/compile: lazily create true and false Values in shortcircuit
    
    It is mildly wasteful to always create values
    that must sometimes then be dead code eliminated.
    Given that it is very easy to avoid, do so.
    
    Noticed when examining a package with thousands
    of generated wrappers, each of which uses
    only a handful of Values to compile.
