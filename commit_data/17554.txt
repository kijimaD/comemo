    runtime: show runtime.panic frame in traceback
    
    Otherwise, if panic starts running deferred functions,
    the code that panicked appears to be calling those
    functions directly, which is not the case and can be
    confusing.
    
    For example:
    
    main.Two()
            /Users/rsc/x.go:12 +0x2a
    runtime.panic(0x20dc0, 0x2100cc010)
            /Users/rsc/g/go/src/pkg/runtime/panic.c:248 +0x106
    main.One()
            /Users/rsc/x.go:8 +0x55
    
    This makes clear(er) that main.Two is being called during
    a panic, not as a direct call from main.One.
    
    Fixes #5832.
