    [dev.link] cmd/link: add dynimp, localentry attributes for loader.Sym
    
    Add new methods to get/set the "dynimplib", "dynimpvers" and
    "localentry" attributes for an external Sym in loader.Loader. These
    attribute values are stored sparsely, since we expect that most
    symbols will not need them; they are set when processing cgo
    directives and when dealing with host object symbols.
