    crypto/tls: enforce that either ServerName or InsecureSkipVerify be given.
    
    crypto/tls has two functions for creating a client connection: Dial,
    which most users are expected to use, and Client, which is the
    lower-level API.
    
    Dial does what you expect: it gives you a secure connection to the host
    that you specify and the majority of users of crypto/tls appear to work
    fine with it.
    
    Client gives more control but needs more care. Specifically, if it
    wasn't given a server name in the tls.Config then it didn't check that
    the server's certificates match any hostname - because it doesn't have
    one to check against. It was assumed that users of the low-level API
    call VerifyHostname on the certificate themselves if they didn't supply
    a hostname.
    
    A review of the uses of Client both within Google and in a couple of
    external libraries has shown that nearly all of them got this wrong.
    
    Thus, this change enforces that either a ServerName or
    InsecureSkipVerify is given. This does not affect tls.Dial.
