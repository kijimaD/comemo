    cmd/link: check DWARF section sizes separately
    
    Currently, we check the total size of all data+DWARF sections
    doesn't exceed 2 GB, which doesn't make sense. We should check
    data and DWARF separately. And for DWARF, check each section
    separately, as we use section offset for references.
