    image/draw: fold TestClipWithNilMP into TestClip.
    
    https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/1876/ introduced a new
    TestClipWithNilMP test, along with a code change that fixed a panic,
    but the existing TestClip test already contained almost enough machinery
    to cover that bug.
    
    There is a small code change in this CL, but it is a no-op: (*x).y is
    equivalent to x.y for a pointer-typed x, but the latter is cleaner.
