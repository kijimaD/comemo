    cmd/dist: support GOROOT vendoring
    
    In the second step of make.bash, cmd/dist builds cmd/go by invoking
    the compiler, linker, and other tools directly on transitive
    dependencies of cmd/go. Essentially, cmd/dist acts as a minimal
    version of 'go install' when building go_toolchain.
    
    Until now, cmd/go has had no transitive dependencies in vendor
    directories. This changes in CL 202698, where several packages are
    deleted and equivalent versions in golang.org/x/mod are used
    instead. So this CL adds support to cmd/dist for vendor directories.
    
    Updates #31761
