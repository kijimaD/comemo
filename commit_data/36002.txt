    cmd/go: if -race, don't run coverage on runtime packages
    
    Don't compile the runtime packages with coverage when using the race
    detector. The user can, perhaps accidentally, request coverage for the
    runtime by using -coverpkg=all. If using the race detector, the
    runtime package coverage will call into the race detector before it
    has been initialized. This will cause the program to crash
    mysteriously on startup.
    
    Fixes #23882
