    exp/norm: a few minor changes in prepration for a table format change:
     - Unified bounary conditions for NFC and NFD and removed some indirections.
       This enforces boundaries at the character level, which is typically what
       the user expects. (NFD allows a boundary between 'a' and '`', for example,
       which may give unexpected results for collation.  The current implementation
       is already stricter than the standard, so nothing much changes.  This change
       just formalizes it.
     - Moved methods of qcflags to runeInfo.
     - Swapped YesC and YesMaybe bits in qcFlags. This is to aid future changes.
     - runeInfo return values use named fields in preperation for struct change.
     - Replaced some left-over uint32s with rune.
