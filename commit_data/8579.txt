    exec: new API, replace Run with Command
    
    This removes exec.Run and replaces exec.Cmd with a
    new implementation. The new exec.Cmd represents
    both a currently-running command and also a command
    being prepared. It has a good zero value.
    
    You can Start + Wait on a Cmd, or simply Run it.
    Start (and Run) deal with copying stdout, stdin,
    and stderr between the Cmd's io.Readers and
    io.Writers.
    
    There are convenience methods to capture a command's
    stdout and/or stderr.
