    cmd/internal/obj/x86: use push/pop instead of mov to store/load FP
    
    This CL changes how the x86 compiler stores and loads the frame pointer
    on each function prologue and epilogue, with the goal to reduce the
    final binary size without affecting performance.
    
    The compiler is currently using MOV instructions to load and store BP,
    which can take from 5 to 8 bytes each.
    
    This CL changes this approach so it emits PUSH/POP instructions instead,
    which always take only 1 byte each (when operating with BP). It can also
    avoid using the SUBQ/ADDQ to grow the stack for functions that have
    frame pointer but does not have local variables.
    
    On Windows, this CL reduces the go toolchain size from 15,697,920 bytes
    to 15,584,768 bytes, a reduction of 0.7%.
    
    Example of epilog and prologue for a function with 0x10 bytes of
    local variables:
    
    Before
    
    ===
     SUBQ    $0x18, SP
     MOVQ    BP, 0x10(SP)
     LEAQ    0x10(SP), BP
    
     ... function body ...
    
     MOVQ    0x10(SP), BP
     ADDQ    $0x18, SP
     RET
    ===
    
    After
    
    ===
      PUSHQ   BP
      LEAQ    0(SP), BP
      SUBQ    $0x10, SP
    
      ... function body ...
    
      MOVQ    ADDQ $0x10, SP
      POPQ    BP
      RET
    ===
