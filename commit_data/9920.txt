    net: fix socket leak in case of Dial failure
    
    Socket descriptors are not closed when fd.connect() fails during generic socket creation.
    After a connection failure [ECONNREFUSED] descriptors are left in SYN_SENT state indefinitely (unless they get an explicit RST). Repeated failed connections will eventually cause your program to hit the user/system max-open-files limit.
    
    Fixes #2349.
