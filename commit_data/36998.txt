    all: enable vet/all for js/wasm and fix vet issues
    
    This commit enables vet/all for the js/wasm architecture. It got
    skipped initially because the codebase did not fully compile yet
    for js/wasm, which made vet/all fail.
    
    startTimer and stopTimer are not needed in the syscall package.
    Removed their assembly code since their Go stubs were already gone.
