    runtime: fix mishandling of timer zombie count
    
    The timer zombie count was fundamentally racy and worked around
    in CL 569995. We worked around that by ignoring underflow.
    The fundamnental race was because t.ts was set before t was
    inserted into ts. CL 564997 corrected that fundamental problem,
    so now we can account for zombies completely accurately,
    never seeing values less than zero. Do that.
