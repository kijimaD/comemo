    html/template: add DefinedTemplates to html/template
    
    It is not important to add, since it's only used for creating an error message,
    but for consistency in the API between text/template and html/template
    it should be provided here.
    
    The implementation just calls the one in text/template.
    
    Fixes #13349.
