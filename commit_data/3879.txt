commit 3317697df4ae2d0e97dc06fb08adad7fd7e90adf
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Sat Nov 7 13:01:52 2009 -0800

    - blank before opening { for multi-line composite literals (as preferred by r)
    - blank padding around composite literal contents for a less dense look
      (most if not all composite literals were written in that style before gofmt
      ran through them)
    - corresponding (internal) flag: compositeLitBlank
    
    - don't print a semi after a one-statement statement list (as preferred by r)
    - corresponding (internal flag): fewerSemis
    
    - the number of changes in nodes.go is huge because of the removed semis;
      hg mail requires that I gofmt the file before
    
    With both flags set to false, this CL causes no gofmt formatting change. We
    can turn them on if we like it (and then remove the flags). Will submit with
    flags disabled.
    
    R=rsc, r
