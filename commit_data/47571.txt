    runtime: add GC testing helpers for regabi signature fuzzer
    
    This CL adds a set of helper functions for testing GC interactions.
    These are intended for use in the regabi signature fuzzer, but are
    generally useful for GC tests, so we make them generally available to
    runtime tests.
    
    These provide:
    
    1. An easy way to force stack movement, for testing stack copying.
    
    2. A simple and robust way to check the reachability of a set of
    pointers.
    
    3. A way to check what general category of memory a pointer points to,
    mostly so tests can make sure they're testing what they mean to.
    
    For #40724, but generally useful.
