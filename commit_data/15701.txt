    cmd/pprof: never use c++filt
    
    The copy of c++filt shipped on OS X is six years old,
    and in our case it does far more mangling than it
    does demangling. People on non-OS X systems will
    have a working nm --demangle, so this won't affect them.
    
    $ sw_vers
    ProductName:    Mac OS X
    ProductVersion: 10.8.2
    BuildVersion:   12C2034
    $ c++filt --version
    GNU c++filt 070207 20070207

    $ go tool nm -n revcomp | grep quoteWith
       4f560 T strconv.quoteWith
    $ go tool nm -n revcomp | grep quoteWith  | c++filt
       f560 T strconv.quoteWith
    $
    
    $ nm -n revcomp | grep quoteWith
    000000000004f560 t _strconv.quoteWith
    $ nm -n revcomp | grep quoteWith | c++filt
    000000000004f560 unsigned short _strconv.quoteWith
    $
    
    Fixes #4818.
