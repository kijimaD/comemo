    gofmt: race condition in error reporting and setting exit code
    
    How to reproduce:
    
            $ mkdir /tmp/foo
            $ cp /dev/null /tmp/foo/bar.go
            $ chmod -r /tmp/foo/bar.go
            $ gofmt /tmp/foo
            open /tmp/foo/bar.go: permission denied
            $ echo $?               # should echo 2
            0
            $
    
    Maybe you need to put a call to time.Sleep at the beginning of report().
