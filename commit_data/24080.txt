    doc: tools for go1.5.html
    
    Don't know why, but git deleted the previous version of this change.
    This is the same change as https://go-review.googlesource.com/11884,
    which I will now abandon, with a couple of fixes.
    
    Almost all done now. Could use help with the TODOs.
    
    Major missing piece is the trace command. Vendoring
    section is also weak, but it's also undocumented elsewhere.
