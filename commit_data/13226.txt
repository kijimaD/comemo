    cmd/6l, cmd/8l, cmd/5l: add AUNDEF instruction
    
    On 6l and 8l, this is a real instruction, guaranteed to
    cause an 'undefined instruction' exception.
    
    On 5l, we simulate it as BL to address 0.
    
    The plan is to use it as a signal to the linker that this
    point in the instruction stream cannot be reached
    (hence the changes to nofollow).  This will help the
    compiler explain that panicindex and friends do not
    return without having to put a list of these functions
    in the linker.
