    doc/next: add motivation and details links for range-over-func iterators
    
    The "Changes to the language" section at the top of the release notes
    will likely ultimately include more explanation about iterators, or at
    least, the Go project will likely publish additional introductory
    material on iterators on the blog and so on.
    
    As a perhaps temporary step given current interest, this CL updates the
    release notes with two additional links for details and motivation.
    
    The new package documentation for the iter package is up-to-date,
    precise, and also more accessible than the language spec, while the 2022
    pre-proposal GitHub discussion starts with perhaps the most compelling
    motivation writeup so far. (We purposefully include "2022" in the text
    to help illustrate this was not the result of an overly hasty process).
    
    We also update the target of the existing language spec reference to be
    closer to the new material.
    
    For #61405.
