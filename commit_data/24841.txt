    test: force heap profile update in heapsampling.go test
    
    The heapsampling.go test occasionally fails on some architectures
    because it finds zero heap samples in main.alloc. This happens because
    the byte and object counts are only updated at a GC. Hence, if a GC
    happens part way through allocInterleaved, but then doesn't happen
    after we start calling main.alloc, checkAllocations will see buckets
    for the lines in main.alloc (which are created eagerly), but the
    object and byte counts will be zero.
    
    Fix this by forcing a GC to update the profile before we collect it.
    
    Fixes #13098.
