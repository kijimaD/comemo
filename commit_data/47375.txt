    cmd/compile: remove ARMv5 special case in register allocator
    
    The register allocator has a special case that doesn't allocate
    LR on ARMv5. This was necessary when softfloat expansion was done
    by the assembler. Now softfloat calls are inserted by SSA, so it
    works as normal. Remove this special case.
