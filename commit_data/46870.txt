    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: worker exiting 0 should not be a crasher
    
    If a worker process exits with status 0, treat it as a communication
    error. Previously, we treated this as a crasher, but it seems more
    likely to be caused by a bug in the fuzz function rather than a bug in
    the code being tested.
