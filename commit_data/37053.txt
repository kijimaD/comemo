    go/types: copy embedded methods unchanged when completing interfaces
    
    The existing code adjusted the receivers of embedded interface methods
    to match the embedding interface type. That required cloning (shallow
    copying) the embedded methods and destroyed their object identity in
    the process. Don't do this anymore. The consequence to clients is that
    they might see different methods of an interface having different
    receiver types; they are always the type of the interface that explicitly
    declared the method (which is what one usually would want, anyway).
    
    Fixes #28282.
