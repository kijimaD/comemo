    runtime: fix check for pending GC work
    
    When findRunnable considers running a fractional mark worker, it first
    checks if there's any work to be done; if there isn't there's no point
    in running the worker because it will just reschedule immediately.
    However, currently findRunnable just checks work.full and
    work.partial, whereas getfull can *also* draw work from m.currentwbuf.
    As a result, findRunnable may not start a worker even though there
    actually is work.
    
    This problem manifests itself in occasional failures of the
    test/init1.go test. This test is unusual because it performs a large
    amount of allocation without executing any write barriers, which means
    there's nothing to force the pointers in currentwbuf out to the
    work.partial/full lists where findRunnable can see them.
    
    This change fixes this problem by making findRunnable also check for a
    currentwbuf. This aligns findRunnable with trygetfull's notion of
    whether or not there's work.
