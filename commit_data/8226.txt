commit bac8f180352213e7fcbe92cc97c96f625e23d2ab
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    gc: fix order of operations for f() < g().
    
    Also, 6g was passing uninitialized
    Node &n2 to regalloc, causing non-deterministic
    register collisions (but only when both left and
    right hand side of comparison had function calls).
    
    Fixes #1728.
