    net/http/cgi: Correctly pass down the REMOTE_PORT value for CGI requests.
    
    Currently when we get a CGI or FCGI request, the remote port of the client
    is hard coded to zero, despite nearly every webserver passing down the
    REMOTE_PORT variable.
    
    This was likely originally excluded because the CGI RFC (rfc3875) does not
    mention anything about the remote port of the client. However every webserver
    tested does pass REMOTE_PORT down. This includes Apache 2.2, Apache 2.4,
    nginx and lighttpd.
    
    Fixes #8351
