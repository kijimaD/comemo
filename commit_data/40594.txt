    cmd/go/internal/modfetch: remove non-hermetic test
    
    The test for gopkg.in/yaml.v2@v2 assumes that there are
    no future upstream releases. That assumption empirically
    does not hold. Backporting fixes to this test is annoying,
    and other gopkg.in cases are already reasonably covered,
    so remove the problematic test.
    
    Updates #28856
