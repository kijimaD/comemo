    crypto/x509: fix getting user home dir on darwin
    
    As pointed out in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26463,
    HOME (or equivalent) environment variable (rather than the
    value obtained by parsing /etc/passwd or the like) should be
    used to obtain user's home directory.
    
    Since commit fa1a49aa556d8 there's a method to obtain
    user's home directory -- use it here.
