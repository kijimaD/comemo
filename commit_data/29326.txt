    doc: clarify that any C compiler works for cgo
    
    Currently the footnote says "gcc is required only if you plan to use cgo",
    but the footnote was referenced from the text:
    
       "use the clang or gcc† that comes with Xcode‡ for cgo support"
    
    That seems to imply that clang doesn't get you cgo support on OS X,
    which isn't true. The update text matches what the install-source.html
    page says.
