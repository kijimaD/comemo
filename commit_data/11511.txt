    crypto/tls: better error message when connecting to SSLv3 servers.
    
    We support SSLv3 as a server but not as a client (and we don't want to
    support it as a client). This change fixes the error message when
    connecting to an SSLv3 server since SSLv3 support on the server side
    made mutualVersion accept SSLv3.
