    os: ensure tests pass even if GOROOT is read-only
    
    We achieve this by always running all tests that create files in a
    fresh temporary directory, rather than just on darwin/{arm,arm64}.
    As a bonus, this lets us simplify the cleanup code for these tests
    and assume their working directory starts out empty.
    
    Updates #28387
