    net/http: fix now-flaky TransportAndServerSharedBodyRace test
    
    TestTransportAndServerSharedBodyRace got flaky after
    issue #9662 was fixed by https://golang.org/cl/11412, which made
    servers hang up on clients when a Handler stopped reading its body
    early.
    
    This test was affected by a race between the the two goroutines in the
    test both only reading part of the request, which was an unnecessary
    detail for what the test was trying to test (concurrent Read/Close
    races on an *http.body)
    
    Also remove an unused remnant from an old test from which this one was
    derived. And make the test not deadlock when it fails. (which was why
    the test was showing up as 2m timeouts on the dashboard)
    
    Fixes #11418
