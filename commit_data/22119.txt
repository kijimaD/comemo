    runtime: document subtlety around entering mark termination
    
    The barrier in gcDrain does not account for concurrent gcDrainNs
    happening in gchelpwork, so it can actually return while there is
    still work being done. It turns out this is okay, but for subtle
    reasons involving gcDrainN always being run on the system
    stack. Document these reasons.
