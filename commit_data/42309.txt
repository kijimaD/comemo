    runtime: avoid overflow in (*mheap).grow
    
    Currently when checking if we can grow the heap into the current arena,
    we do an addition which may overflow. This is particularly likely on
    32-bit systems.
    
    Avoid this situation by explicitly checking for overflow, and adding in
    some comments about when overflow is possible, when it isn't, and why.
    
    For #35954.
