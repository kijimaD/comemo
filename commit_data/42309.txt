    misc/cgo/testshared: do not write to GOROOT
    
    Instead of installing shared libraries to GOROOT/pkg, clone the
    necessary files into a new GOROOT and run there.
    
    Given that we now have a build cache, ideally we should not need to
    install into GOROOT/pkg at all, but we can't fix that during the 1.14
    code freeze.
