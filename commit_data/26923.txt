    misc/trace: update trace viewer html
    
    The old trace-viewer is broken since Chrome 49:
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=569417
    It was fixed in:
    https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/commit/506457cbd726324f327b80ae11f46c1dfeb8710d
    
    This change updates trace-viewer to the latest version
    (now it is called catapult).
    
    This version has a bug in the lean config that we use, though:
    https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/issues/2247
    So use full config for now (it works, but leads to larger html).
    When the bug is fixed we need to switch back to lean config (issue #15302).
