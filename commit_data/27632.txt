    io: add ReadAtSizer interface
    
    ReadAtSizer is a common abstraction for a stateless,
    concurrently-readable fixed number of bytes.
    
    This interface has existed in various codebases for over 3 years (previously
    usually named SizeReaderAt). It is used inside Google in dl.google.com
    (mentioned in https://talks.golang.org/2013/oscon-dl.slide) and other
    packages. It is used in Camlistore, in Juju, in the Google API Go client, in
    github.com/nightlyone/views, and 33 other pages of Github search results.
    
    It is implemented by io.SectionReader, bytes.Reader, strings.Reader, etc.
    
    Time to finally promote this interface to the standard library and give it a
    standard name, blessing it as best practice.
