    math: improve documentation of Copysign
    
    Name the arguments in a way that is more self-describing.
    Many code editor tools show a snippet of the function and
    its arguments. However, "x" and "y" are not helpful in determining
    which is the sign and which is the magnitude,
    short of reading the documentation itself.
    
    Name the sign argument as "sign" to be explicit.
    This follows the same naming convention as IsInf.
