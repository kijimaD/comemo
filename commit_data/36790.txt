    cmd/cgo: use standard generated code comment
    
    Change cgo to follow https://golang.org/s/generatedcode.
    
    For the C code we continue to use /* */ comments, so they don't follow
    the format exactly. It doesn't really matter since the format is only
    for Go code anyhow. This CL changes the C code to be similar for
    consistency.
    
    Fixes #25623
