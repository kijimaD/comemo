    cmd/link: reliably remove temporary directory in testDwarf
    
    We were using t.Parallel in a subtest, which meant that the main test
    would not wait for the subtest, so the main test would delete the
    temporary directory before the subtest used it. The subtest worked
    because "go build -o /tmp/x/y/p.exe p" creates /tmp/x/y as needed.
