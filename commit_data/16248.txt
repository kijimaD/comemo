    cmd/ld: emit relocs for DWARF info when doing an external link
    
    I would like opinions on whether this is a good idea for 1.1.
    On the one hand it's a moderately important issue.  On the
    other hand this introduces at least the possibility of
    external linker errors due to the additional relocations and
    it may be better to wait.
    
    I'm fairly confident that the behaviour is unchanged when not
    using an external linker.
    
    Update #5221
    
    This CL is tested lightly on 386 and amd64 and fixes the cases
    I tested.  I have not tested it on Darwin or Windows.
