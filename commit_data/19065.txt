+As part of the general <a href="http://golang.org/s/go13linker">overhaul</a> to
+the Go linker, the compilers and linkers have been refactored.
+The linker is still a C program, but now the instruction selection phase that
+was part of the linker has been moved to the compiler through the creation of a new
+library called <code>liblink</code>.
+By doing instruction selection only once, when the package is first compiled,
+this can speed up compilation of large projects significantly.
