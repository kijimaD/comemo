    cmd/go/internal/modindex: avoid walking modules when not needed
    
    Due to a missed condition in CL 412394, we were walking all modules
    (instead of just the ones contained in GOROOT) at each invocation of a
    devel version of cmd/go.
    
    Moreover, while we were running cmd/go tests, we were re-walking
    GOROOT at each 'go' invocation in the test even though we expect
    GOROOT to be stable within a test run.
    
    This change always avoids walking non-GOROOT modules, and also adds a
    salt (configurable via GODEBUG) and uses it to avoid walking GOROOT
    modules when GOROOT is known to be stable (such as over the course of
    a 'cmd/go' test run).
    
    This should fix the cmd/go test timeouts that are currently occurring
    on the dragonfly-amd64 builder, such as this one:
    https://build.golang.org/log/21c01c3ae5490d387d84abeaf872b3a0a76ab8e5
    
    Updates #53290.
