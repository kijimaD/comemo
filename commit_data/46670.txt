    internal/fuzz: disconnect stdout and stderr from the worker
    
    This was useful for debugging while we were developing
    the feature, but is now causing extraneous prints that
    make the command output difficult to read.
    
    This change also prevents the go command from printing
    an extraneous "FAIL" when fuzzing is enabled.
    
    Fixes #48633
    Fixes #46631
