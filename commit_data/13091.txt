    exp/locale/collate: implementation of main collation functionality for
    key and simple comparisson. Search is not yet implemented in this CL.
    Changed some of the types of table_test.go to allow reuse in the new test.
    Also reduced number of primary values for illegal runes to 1 (both map to
    the same).
