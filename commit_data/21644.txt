    runtime: fix GDB "info goroutines" for Go 1.5
    
    "info goroutines" is failing because it hasn't kept up with changes in
    the 1.5 runtime.  This fixes three issues preventing "info goroutines"
    from working.  allg is no longer a linked list, so switch to using the
    allgs slice.  The g struct's 'status' field is now called
    'atomicstatus', so rename uses of 'status'.  Finally, this was trying
    to parse str(pc) as an int, but str(pc) can return symbolic
    information after the raw hex value; fix this by stripping everything
    after the first space.
    
    This also adds a test for "info goroutines" to runtime-gdb_test, which
    was previously quite skeletal.
