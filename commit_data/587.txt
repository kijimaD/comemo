commit 7231ceb714aa8c5df479dc772590e1495d3f3df4
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 8 15:01:04 2008 -0700

    Proposal for new function type syntax as suggested by ken:
    - removed "func" from function type
    - make it work by changing composite literal syntax to use {} instead of ()
    
    FunctionType is now more in line with the rest of the declarations, as the
    keyword "func" is now really part of the declaration and not part of the type.
