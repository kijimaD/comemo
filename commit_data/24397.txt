    runtime: close window that hides GC work from concurrent mark
    
    Currently we enter mark 2 by first flushing all existing gcWork caches
    and then setting gcBlackenPromptly, which disables further gcWork
    caching. However, if a worker or assist pulls a work buffer in to its
    gcWork cache after that cache has been flushed but before caching is
    disabled, that work may remain in that cache until mark termination.
    If that work represents a heap bottleneck (e.g., a single pointer that
    is the only way to reach a large amount of the heap), this can force
    mark termination to do a large amount of work, resulting in a long
    STW.
    
    Fix this by reversing the order of these steps: first disable caching,
    then flush all existing caches.
    
    Rick Hudson <rlh> did the hard work of tracking this down. This CL
    combined with CL 12672 and CL 12646 distills the critical parts of his
    fix from CL 12539.
    
    Fixes #11694.
