    encoding/json: properly handle extra objects with fixed size arrays
    
    If a fixed size array is passed in as the decode target and the JSON
    to decode has extra array elements that are objects, then previously
    the decoder would return a "data changing underfoot" error.
    
    Fixes #3717.
