    text/template: clarify the safety of Template.New
    
    In particular, the returned template isn't independent from the parent.
    For example, it can't be parsed concurrently with other children
    templates. Only methods which are explicitly safe for concurrent use,
    like Execute, may be used concurrently.
    
    Fixes #30281.
