    runtime: prevent preemption while releasing worldsema in gcStart
    
    Currently, as a result of us releasing worldsema now to allow STW events
    during a mark phase, we release worldsema between starting the world and
    having the goroutine block in STW mode. This inserts preemption points
    which, if followed through, could lead to a deadlock. Specifically,
    because user goroutine scheduling is disabled in STW mode, the goroutine
    will block before properly releasing worldsema.
    
    The fix here is to prevent preemption while releasing the worldsema.
    
    Fixes #38404.
    Updates #19812.
