    math: speed up Gamma(+Inf)
    
    Add special case for Gamma(+∞) which speeds it up:
    
    benchmark            old ns/op     new ns/op     delta
    BenchmarkGamma-4     14.5          7.44          -48.69%
    
    The documentation for math.Gamma already specifies it as a special
    case:
    
            Gamma(+Inf) = +Inf
    
    The original C code that has been used as the reference implementation
    (as mentioned in the comments in gamma.go) also treats Gamma(+∞) as a
    special case:
    
    if( x == INFINITY )
            return(x);
