    runtime: fix heapBitsSweepSpan comment
    
    Currently the heapBitsSweepSpan comment claims that heapBitsSweepSpan
    sets the heap bitmap for the first two words to dead. In fact, it sets
    the first *four* words to scalar/dead. This is important because first
    two words don't actually have a dead bit, so for objects larger than
    two words it *must* set a dead bit in third word to reset the object
    to a "noscan" state. For example, we use this in heapBits.hasPointers
    to detect that an object larger than two words is noscan.
