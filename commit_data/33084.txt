    cmd/link: eliminate .debug_aranges
    
    The .debug_aranges section is an odd vestige of DWARF, since its
    contents are easy and efficient for a debugger to reconstruct from the
    attributes of the top-level compilation unit DIEs. Neither GCC nor
    clang emit it by default these days. GDB and Delve ignore it entirely.
    LLDB will use it if present, but is happy to construct the index from
    the compilation unit attributes (and, indeed, a remarkable variety of
    other ways if those aren't available either).
    
    We're about to split up the compilation units by package, which means
    they'll have discontiguous PC ranges, which is going to make
    .debug_aranges harder to construct (and larger).
    
    Rather than try to maintain this essentially unused code, let's
    simplify things and remove it.
