    cmd/link: improve gap detection in TestPIESize
    
    In CL 210180 we detect gaps between PT_LOAD segments and subtract
    them from size calculation. The code there only works when
    PT_LOAD segments are next to each other. But it is possible that
    there are other segments in between (e.g. a GNU_RELRO segment).
    Relax the gap detection to count gaps between PT_LOAD segments
    regardless of whether they are next to each other.
    
    Updates #36023.
    Updates #35545.
