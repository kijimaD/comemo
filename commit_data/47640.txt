    cmd/dist: include "go1.x-" in devel go version strings
    
    This way, "go version" will report the "base version" or major version
    that the tool corresponds to. This is the same version number that is
    matched against build tags such as "go1.14" or "!go1.16".
    
    Obtaining this version being built is non-trivial, since we can't just
    import a package or query git. The added comments document the chosen
    mechanism, based on a regular expression. It was chosen over AST parsing
    as it would add a significant amount of code without much gain, given
    how simple the goversion.go file is.
    
    For #41116.
