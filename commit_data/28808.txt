    runtime: reduce GC assist extra credit
    
    Mutator goroutines that allocate memory during the concurrent mark
    phase are required to spend some time assisting the garbage
    collector. The magnitude of this mandatory assistance is proportional
    to the goroutine's allocation debt and subject to the assistance
    ratio as calculated by the pacer.
    
    When assisting the garbage collector, a mutator goroutine will go
    beyond paying off its allocation debt. It will build up extra credit
    to amortize the overhead of the assist.
    
    In fast-allocating applications with high assist ratios, building up
    this credit can take the affected goroutine's entire time slice.
    Reduce the penalty on each goroutine being selected to assist the GC
    in two ways, to spread the responsibility more evenly.
    
    First, do a consistent amount of extra scan work without regard for
    the pacer's assistance ratio. Second, reduce the magnitude of the
    extra scan work so it can be completed within a few hundred
    microseconds.
