    archive/zip: support full range of FileMode flags
    
    Zip files may actually store symlinks, and that's represented
    as a file with unix flag S_IFLNK and with its data containing
    the symlink target name.
    
    The other flags are being supported too. Now that the os package
    has the full range of flags in a system agnostic manner, there's
    no reason to discard that information.
