    net/http: make DefaultTransport's Dialer enable DualStack ("Happy Eyeballs")
    
    As @pmarks-net said in the bug, this is something of a prisoner's
    dilemma, but it does help people who occasionally report problems.
    
    This is temporary. IPv6 is happening regardless of our decision here,
    so we'll do this for now.
    
    Fixes #15324
