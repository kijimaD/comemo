    [dev.cc] 9l: make R_CALLPOWER like ELF's R_PPC64_REL24
    
    These accomplished the same thing, but R_CALLPOWER expected
    the whole instruction to be in the addend (and completely
    overwrote what was in the text section), while R_PPC64_REL24
    overwrites only bits 6 through 24 of whatever was in the text
    section.  Make R_CALLPOWER work like R_PPC64_REL24 to ease the
    implementation of dynamic linking.
