    runtime: remove trailing empty arrays in structs
    
    The ones at the end of M and G are just used to compute
    their size for use in assembly.  Generate the size explicitly.
    The one at the end of itab is variable-sized, and at least one.
    The ones at the end of interfacetype and uncommontype are not
    needed, as the preceding slice references them (the slice was
    originally added for use by reflect?).
    The one at the end of stackmap is already accessed correctly,
    and the runtime never allocates one.
    
    Update #9401
