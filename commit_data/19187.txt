    cmd/ld: restore the call graph dump
    
    Before the switch to liblink, the linkers accepted the -c flag
    to print the call graph. This change restores the functionality.
    
    This came in handy when I was trying to audit the use of SSE
    instructions inside the Plan 9 note handler.
