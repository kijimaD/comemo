    cmd/trace/v2: make the -pprof actually useful
    
    In both the v1 and v2 cmd/trace, pprofMatchingGoroutines will generate
    no output at all if the filter name passed to it is the empty string.
    
    This is rather pointless because there are at least two places where we
    don't pass a name to filter. Modify pprofMatchingGoroutines to include
    *all* goroutines in the trace if the name to filter by is not specified.
    
    For #66782.
