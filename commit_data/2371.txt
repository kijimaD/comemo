    8g:
      * floating point -> integer conversions.
        x86 defines that overflow/underflow
        results in 1<<15, 1<<31, 1<<63 for
        int16, int32, int64.  when building the
        unsigned conversions out of the native signed
        ones, 8g turns overflow/underflow into zero.
        the spec does not say what should happen.
    
      * many tiny bug fixes.  can run a large number
        of files from go/test now, and can fmt.Printf.
    
      * struggling with byte register allocation
        and float32 computation.
