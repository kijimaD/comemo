    spec: specify evaluation order for binary logical operations
    
    This CL clarifies the order of evaluation of the binary logical
    operators, && and ||. The clarified semantics matches what cmd/compile
    and x/tools/go/ssa already implement, and prohibit some optimizations
    that are arguably allowed today but risk surprising users.
    
    First, it specifies that the left operand is evaluated before the
    right operand. This prohibits "(f() || true) && *p" from evaluating
    "*p" before "f()".
    
    Second, it specifies that binary logical operations are also ordered
    lexically left-to-right with regard to function calls and receive
    operations. This prohibits "h(*p || true || f(), g())" from evaluating
    "*p" after "g()".
    
    Finally, the "order of evaluation of [...] is not specified" wording
    in the example is clarified to acknowledge that there are still some
    other orderings that are implied lexically; e.g., x must be evaluated
    and indexed before g(), and z now must be evaluated before h(). (Note:
    Whether z is evaluated before or after f() remains unspecified, as
    there's no lexical dependency.)
