    reflect: fix bucketOf to only look at ptrdata entries in gcdata
    
    The gcdata field only records ptrdata entries, not size entries.
    
    Also fix an obsolete comment: the enforced limit on pointer maps is
    now 2048 bytes, not 16 bytes.
    
    I wasn't able to contruct a test case for this. It would require
    building a type whose size is greater than 64 bytes but less than 128
    bytes, with at least one pointer in first 64 bytes but no pointers
    after the first 64 bytes, such that the linker arranges for the one
    byte gcbits value to be immediately followed by a non-zero byte.
