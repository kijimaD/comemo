    cmd/go: avoid running slow tests on non-longtest builders
    
    Also annotate calls to tooSlow with specific reasons.
    
    This will somewhat reduce test coverage on the 'darwin' builders until
    we have darwin 'longtest' builders (#35678,#49055), but still seems
    worthwhile to avoid alert fatigue from tests that really shouldn't be
    running in the short configurations.
    
    Fixes #58918.
    Fixes #58919.
