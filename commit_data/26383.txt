    runtime: use at least "system" traceback level for runtime tests
    
    While the default behavior of eliding runtime frames from tracebacks
    usually makes sense, this is not the case when you're trying to test
    the runtime itself. Fix this by forcing the traceback level to at
    least "system" in the runtime tests.
    
    This will specifically help with debugging issue #13645, which has
    proven remarkably resistant to reproduction outside of the build
    dashboard itself.
