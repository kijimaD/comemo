    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: count -fuzzminimizetime toward -fuzztime
    
    Previously, when -fuzztime was given a number of executions like
    -fuzztime=100x, this was a count for each minimization independent of
    -fuzztime. Since there is no bound on the number of minimizations,
    this was not a meaningful limit.
    
    With this change, executions of the fuzz function during minimization
    count toward the -fuzztime global limit. Executions are further
    limited by -fuzzminimizetime.
    
    This change also counts executions during the coverage-only run and
    reports errors for those executions.
    
    There is no change when -fuzztime specifies a duration or when
    -fuzztime is not set.
