    net: avoid unnecessary interface lookup fetching all interface addresses
    
    InterfaceAddrs returns a list of the system's unicast interface addresses.
    
    In order to do so, the function reuses the existing helpers and
    list first all addresses with the netlink call RTM_GETADDR, then
    all interfaces with RTM_GETLINK, and later it merge both lists
    (each address references an interface).
    
    However, the list of interfaces and addresses are obtained at
    different times and there can be inconsistencies and, if an
    address references an interface that is not present in the list
    of interfaces, the function fails with an error.
    
    Since the function InterfaceAddress is only about the system
    addresses, there is no need to list all the interfaces, and we can
    obtain the list of addresses directly from the netlink call RTM_GETADDR.
    There is no need to correlate this list with the list of interfaces, as
    the OS is the source of truth and should be the one providing the
    consistency between addresses and interfaces.
    
    Fixes #51934
