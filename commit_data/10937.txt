    net, syscall: interface address and mask
    
    This CL makes both InterfaceAddrs and Addrs method on Interface
    return IPNet struct for representing interface address and mask
    like below:
    
    interface "lo0": flags "up|loopback|multicast", ifindex 1, mtu 16384
            interface address "fe80::1/64"
            interface address "127.0.0.1/8"
            interface address "::1/128"
            joined group address "ff02::fb"
            joined group address "224.0.0.251"
            joined group address "ff02::2:65d0:d71e"
            joined group address "224.0.0.1"
            joined group address "ff01::1"
            joined group address "ff02::1"
            joined group address "ff02::1:ff00:1"
    
    Fixes #2571.
