commit d731dc8e72955e05fc69536aae7f6be328e3922c

    Addressing issue brought up by dsymonds:
    - When providing alternative spellings to a query, do not
      prefix it with a package qualifier as the suggestion may
      not have any results. Correctly filtering is quite a bit
      of work, and clicking the alternative spelling will always
      also show the qualified hits if they exist (but also others).
      Seems good enough for now.
    - Give user feedback when the query syntax was wrong.
    - Package names in search results are now links to the respective
      package documentation.
    - Experimented with excluding main packages and test files
      from index with inconclusive results. Code is present and
      can be enabled by changing a flag in the source. This needs
      some more work.
