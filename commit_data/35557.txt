    runtime: ensure sysStat for mheap_.arenas is aligned
    
    We don't want to account the memory for mheap_.arenas because most of
    it is never touched, so currently we pass the address of a uint64 on
    the heap. However, at least on mips, it's possible for this uint64 to
    be unaligned, which causes the atomic add in mSysStatInc to crash.
    
    Fix this by instead passing a nil stat pointer.
    
    Fixes #23946.
