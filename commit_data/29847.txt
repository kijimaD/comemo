    runtime: clean up and improve reflect.methodValue comments
    
    The runtime no longer hard-codes the offset of
    reflect.methodValue.stack, so remove these obsolete comments. Also,
    reflect.methodValue and runtime.reflectMethodValue must also agree
    with reflect.makeFuncImpl, so update the comments on all three to
    mention this.
    
    This was pointed out by Minux on CL 31138.
