    runtime: add padding to Linux kernel structures sigcontext on loong64
    
    On linux/loong64, the sc_extcontext member in the sigcontext structure is
    required to be 16-byte aligned [1], although sc_extcontext is not currently
    used anywhere, it still needs to be padded to the specified alignment.
