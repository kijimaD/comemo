    cmd/internal/link: disable selected DWARF tests on Solaris
    
    Disable the three linker DWARF tests that invoke the compiler in
    non-debug mode on Solaris, since this seems to trigger a split stack
    overflow. These can be turned back on once the issue in question is
    resolved.
    
    Updates #23168.
