commit 1778f50da3a14b310ad987dbbe4c3e2ea3872ff4

    gob: decode into nil, this time for sure.
    
    Yesterday's change was too simple-minded and failed if an
    interface value was being discarded.  We need to parse the
    data stream and remember any type information that arrives.
    
    Also fix a minor bug when ignoring an interface: toss only what
    we know about, not everything.
