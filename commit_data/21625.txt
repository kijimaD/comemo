commit 7aa68756c5518e0fc2e2f65cab6b933c1c48534a
Author: Shenghou Ma <minux@golang.org>

    doc/asm: document that assembly function must use short name
    
    e.g. ·Name instead of package·Name for automatic stack map to
    be applied from its Go prototype.
    
    The underlying reason is that liblink look up name with suffix
    ".args_stackmap" for the stackmap coming from its Go prototype,
    but all the Go functions are named "".Name as this stage. Thus
    an assembly function named package·Name will never find its
    stackmap, which is named "".package.Name.args_stackmap.
    
    Perhaps cmd/vet should give a warning for this.
