    debug/dwarf: better handling for DW_FORM_indirect
    
    Fix a buglet in abbrev processing related to DW_FORM_indirect. When
    reading an abbrev entry if we encounter an attribute with form
    DW_FORM_indirect, leave the class as ClassUnknown, then when the
    abbrev is walked during the reading of the DIE fill in the class based
    on the value read at that point (code for handling DW_FORM_indirect
    seems to be already partially in place in the DIE reader).
    
    Updates #33488.
