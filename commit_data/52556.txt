    cmd/compile: get more bounds info from logic operators in prove pass
    
    Currently, the prove pass can get knowledge from some specific logic
    operators only before the CFG is explored, which means that the bounds
    information of the branch will be ignored.
    
    This CL updates the facts table by the logic operators in every
    branch. Combined with the branch information, this will be helpful for
    BCE in some circumstances.
    
    Fixes #57243
