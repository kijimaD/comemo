    cmd/gc: record &x[0] as taking address of x, if x is an array
    
    Not recording the address being taken was causing
    the liveness analysis not to preserve x in the absence
    of direct references to x, which in turn was making the
    net test fail with GOGC=0.
    
    In addition to the test, this fixes a bug wherein
            GOGC=0 go test -short net
    crashed if liveness analysis was in use (like at tip, not like Go 1.2).
