    cmd/go: remove references to 1.13 in 'go help modules'
    
    In "Module support" section, there were two mentions of "Go 1.13",
    assuming that's the latest version. Rather than update these to 1.14,
    this CL changes those to "The go command".
    
    Also, a minor change in wording for finding go.mod files.
