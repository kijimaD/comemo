    Emacs go-mode: don't indent the inside of strings.
    
    Two fixes for indentation problems:
    
    1. Properly recognize multi-line strings. These start with `, not ".
    
    2. Don't indent a line if the beginning of the line is the end of a multi-line string. This happened for instance when inserting a closing bracket after a multi-line string.
