    runtime/pprof: include PCs for deduplication in TestMutexBlockFullAggregation
    
    TestMutexBlockFullAggregation aggregates stacks by function, file, and
    line number. But there can be multiple function calls on the same line,
    giving us different sequences of PCs. This causes the test to spuriously
    fail in some cases. Include PCs in the stacks for this test.
    
    Also pick up a small "range over int" modernize suggestion while we're
    looking at the test.
    
    Fixes #73641
