    io: add WriterTo to MultiReader
    
    This patch allows to zerocopy using MultiReader.
    This is done by MultiReader implementing WriterTo.
    
    Each sub reader is copied using usual io copy helper and thus use
    WriterTo or ReadFrom with reflection.
    
    There is a special case for when a subreader is a MultiReader.
    Instead of using copyBuffer which would call multiReader.WriteTo,
    multiReader.writeToWithBuffer is used instead, the difference
    is that the temporary copy buffer is passed along, saving
    allocations for nested MultiReaders.
    
    The workflow looks like this:
    - multiReader.WriteTo (allocates 32k buffer)
      - multiReader.writeToWithBuffer
        - for each subReader:
          - is instance of multiReader ?
            - yes, call multiReader.writeToWithBuffer
            - no, call copyBuffer(writer, currentReader, buffer)
              - does currentReader implements WriterTo ?
               - yes, use use currentReader.WriteTo
               - no, does writer implement ReadFrom ?
                 - yes, use writer.ReadFrom
                 - no, copy using Read / Write with buffer
    
    This can be improved by lazy allocating the 32k buffer.
    For example a MultiReader of such types:
      MultiReader(
        bytes.Reader, // WriterTo-able
        bytes.Reader, // WriterTo-able
        bytes.Reader, // WriterTo-able
      )
    
    Doesn't need any allocation, all copy can be done using bytes.Reader's
    internal data slice. However currently we still allocate a 32k buffer
    for nothing.
    
    This optimisation has been omitted for a future patch because of high
    complexity costs for a non obvious performance cost (it needs a benchmark).
    This patch at least is on par with the previous MultiReader.Read
    workflow allocation wise.
    
    Fixes #50842
