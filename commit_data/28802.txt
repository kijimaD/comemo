    runtime/pprof: document use of pprof package
    
    Currently the pprof package gives almost no guidance for how to use it
    and, despite the standard boilerplate used to create CPU and memory
    profiles, this boilerplate appears nowhere in the pprof documentation.
    
    Update the pprof package documentation to give the standard
    boilerplate in a form people can copy, paste, and tweak. This
    boilerplate is based on rsc's 2011 blog post on profiling Go programs
    at https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs, which is where I
    always go when I need to copy-paste the boilerplate.
