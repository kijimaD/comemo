    crypto/tls: improve documentation for ServerName.
    
    Users of the low-level, Client function are frequenctly missing the
    fact that, unless they pass a ServerName to the TLS connection then it
    cannot verify the certificates against any name.
    
    This change makes it clear that at least one of InsecureSkipVerify and
    ServerName should always be set.
