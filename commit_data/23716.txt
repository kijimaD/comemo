    all: use RET instead of RETURN on ppc64
    
    All of the architectures except ppc64 have only "RET" for the return
    mnemonic. ppc64 used to have only "RETURN", but commit cf06ea6
    introduced RET as a synonym for RETURN to make ppc64 consistent with
    the other architectures. However, that commit was never followed up to
    make the code itself consistent by eliminating uses of RETURN.
    
    This commit replaces all uses of RETURN in the ppc64 assembly with
    RET.
    
    This was done with
        sed -i 's/\<RETURN\>/RET/' **/*_ppc64x.s
    plus one manual change to syscall/asm.s.
