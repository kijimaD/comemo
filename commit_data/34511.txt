    net/url: preserve leading slashes when resolving path
    
    When doing resolvePath, if there are multiple leading slashes in the
    target, preserve them. This prevents an issue where the Go http.Client
    cleans up multiple leading slashes in the Location header in a
    redirect, resulting in a redirection to the incorrect target.
    
    Fixes #21158.
