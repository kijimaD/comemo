commit 8da180f6cac51f6cb8a316b962f797dbaf7ee96f
Author: Daniel Martí <mvdan@mvdan.cc>

    all: remove some unused return parameters
    
    As found by unparam. Picked the low-hanging fruit, consisting only of
    errors that were always nil and results that were never used. Left out
    those that were useful for consistency with other func signatures.
