    runtime: fixes for arm64 shared libraries
    
    Building for shared libraries requires that all functions that are declared
    have an implementation and vice versa so make that so on arm64.
    
    It would be nicer to not require the stub sigreturn (it will never be called)
    but that seems a bit awkward.
