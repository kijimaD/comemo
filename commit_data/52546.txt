    go/doc: group play example imports
    
    When synthesizing a program from a playable example, preserve
    the grouping of imports. That is, maintain blank lines between
    imports while removing unused ones.
    
    People are used to having those groups because that is what goimports
    does.  It's disconcerting to see the all imports placed together, as
    the existing code does, especially when the user has already grouped
    them.
    
    For an example, see golang/go#43658.
    
    This is an improvement to a fix in pkgsite's fork of go/doc
    (https://go.googlesource.com/pkgsite/+/7b10ef3861af4a863bf215f63b6de94c681d5af0/internal/godoc/internal/doc/example_pkgsite.go#405).
    Here I've managed to avoid using a token.FileSet.
