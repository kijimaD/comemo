    cmd/compile: remove ssagen/pgen_test.go
    
    This test was written in 2015, and hasn't had any meaningful changes
    to it since. However, it's very ad hoc and pokes into internals that
    it shouldn't, and it keeps getting in the way of more meaningful
    refactorings. It doesn't even catch bugs; e.g., it didn't catch that
    cmpstackvarlt wasn't asymmetric (CL 19778), and a bunch of its test
    cases are bogus because we never actually use it to sort ir.PFUNC
    nodes (assert added in this CL).
    
    The compiler is woefully lacking in unit tests like these, but I
    strongly feel this test is more of a hinderance than a help at the
    moment.
