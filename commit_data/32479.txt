    testing: error if -parallel is given N<1
    
    Otherwise, if there are any parallel tests, it will hang and panic with
    "all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!".
    
    Do not use flag.Uint to handle the error for us because we also want to
    error on N==0, and because it would make setting the default to
    GOMAXPROCS(0) more difficult, since it's an int.
    
    Check for it right after flag.Parse, and mimic flag errors by printing
    the usage and returning exit code 2.
    
    Fixes #20542.
