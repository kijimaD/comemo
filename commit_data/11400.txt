    go/doc: revert API change (per former discussion) and cleanup
    
    Separating Method from Func made the code only more complicated
    without adding much to the useability/readability of the API.
    Reverted to where it was, but leaving the new method-specific
    fields Orig and Level.
    
    Former clients (godoc) of doc.Method only used the Func fields;
    and because Func was embedded, no changes are needed with respect
    to the removal of Method.
    
    Changed type of Func.Recv from ast.Expr to string. This was a
    long-standing TODO. Also implemented Func.Orig field (another TODO).
    
    No further go/doc API changes are expected for Go 1.
