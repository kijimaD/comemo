    runtime/pprof/internal: add package protopprof
    
    This change adds code, originally written by Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
    and open-sourced by Google, that converts from the "legacy"
    binary pprof profile format to a struct representation of the
    new protocol buffer pprof profile format.
    
    This code reads the entire binary format for conversion to the
    protobuf format. In a future change, we will update the code
    to incrementally read and convert segments of the binary format,
    so that the entire profile does not need to be stored in memory.
    
    This change also contains contributions by Daria Kolistratova
    <daria.kolistratova@intel.com> from the rolled-back change
    golang.org/cl/30556 adapting the code to be used by the package
    runtime/pprof.
    
    This code also appeared in the change golang.org/cl/32257, which was based
    on Daria Kolistratova's change, but was also rolled back.
    
    Updates #16093
