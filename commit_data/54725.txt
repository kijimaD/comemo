    cmd/go: drop unnecessary Package arguments
    
    There are several functions that take both an Action argument and a
    Package argument. It takes a decent amount of work to determine that
    in all cases the value of the Package argument is just Action.Package.
    This makes these Package arguments both redundant and potentially
    confusing because it makes these APIs look like they have more
    flexibility than they actually do.
    
    Drop these unnecessary Package arguments.
    
    For #62067.
