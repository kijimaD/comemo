    net/http: start of making all relevant tests test both http1 and http2
    
    This CL adds skipped failing tests, showing differences between HTTP/1
    and HTTP/2 behavior. They'll be fixed in later commits.
    
    Only a tiny fraction of the net/http tests have been split into their
    "_h1" and "_h2" variants. That will also continue. (help welcome)
