    reflect: remove out of date UTF-8 StructOf restriction
    
    The initial implementation of reflect.StructOf in
    https://golang.org/cl/9251 had a limitation that field names had to be
    ASCII, which was later lifted by https://golang.org/cl/21777.  Remove
    the out-of-date documentation disallowing UTF-8 field names.
    
    Updates: #5748
    Updates: #15064
