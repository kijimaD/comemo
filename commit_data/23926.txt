    cmd/go: permit installing into a subdirectory of $GOPATH/bin
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/12080 we forbade installing cross-compiled
    binaries into a subdirectory of $GOBIN, in order to fix
    https://golang.org/issue/9769.  However, that fix was too aggressive,
    in that it also forbade installing into a subdirectory of $GOPATH/bin.
    
    This patch permits installing cross-compiled binaries into a
    subdirectory $GOPATH/bin while continuing to forbid installing into a
    subdirectory of $GOBIN.
    
    Fixes #11778.
