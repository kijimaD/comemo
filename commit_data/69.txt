commit d222c65477e0c3215a8902eecfb3530687325cd8
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Tue May 6 10:29:17 2008 -0700

    Introduced forward declaration of types per discussion with ken.
    A forward-declared (or not yet fully defined) type must be used
    to construct (mutually) recursive type declarations. This simplifies
    the compiler and resolves the issue at which scope the forward-
    declared type is to be declared.
