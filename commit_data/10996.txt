+This snapshot includes changes to the images/ycbcr and testing packages, and
+changes to the build system.
+
+The types for managing Y'CbCr images in the image/ycbcr have been moved to the
+image and image/color packages. A gofix module will rewrite affected code.
+
+The testing package's B type (used when running benchmarks) now has the same
+methods as T (used in tests), such as Print, Error, and Fatal.
+
+This weekly adds a new command named 'go' for building and testing go programs.
+For Go 1, the go command will replace the makefile-based approach that we have
+been using. It is not yet ready for general use, but all.bash does use it to
+build the tree. If you have problems building the weekly, you can 'export
+USE_GO_TOOL=false' before running all.bash to fall back to the makefiles.
+
+Other changes:
+* archive/zip: add SetModTime method to FileHeader.
+* build: make use of env (thanks Mikio Hara),

+* go/ast, parser: remember short variable decls. w/ correspoding ident objects.
+* go/build: add new +build tags 'cgo' and 'nocgo'.

+	use strconv.Append variants to avoid allocations in encoding.
+* ld: add support for netbsd signature note section (thanks Joel Sing),
+	allow for IMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR32NB relocation type (thanks Alex Brainman).
+* math/big: Rand shouldn't hang if argument is also receiver.
