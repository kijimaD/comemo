commit 2ad8a9c507ede9621bb1cd1f8d02f6cdac7a9e88

    go: implement build, install, run
    
    clean is gone; all the intermediate files are created
    in a temporary tree that is wiped when the command ends.
    
    Not using go/build's Script because it is not well aligned
    with this API.  The various builder methods are copied from
    go/build and adapted.  Probably once we delete goinstall
    we can delete the Script API too.
