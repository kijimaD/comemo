    internal/pkgbits: indent productions and hoist some types up
    
    The types being hoisted are those which cannot be referenced; that is,
    where Ref[T] is illegal. These are most clearly owned by pkgbits. The
    types which follow are those which can be referenced.
    
    Referenceable types are more hazy due to the reference mechanism of UIR
    - sections. These are a detail of the UIR file format and are surfaced
    directly to importers.
    
    I suspect that pkgbits would benefit from a reference mechanism not
    dependent on sections. This would permit us to push down many types
    from the noder into pkgbits, reducing the interface surface without
    giving up deduplication.
