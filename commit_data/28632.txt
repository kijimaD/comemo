    syscall: fix Send{msg,msgN}, Recvmsg and control message handling on solaris
    
    This change switches the use of socket implementation from the
    conventional SUS-based one to the latest POSIX-based one to make
    socket control message work correctly on Solaris.
    
    It looks like those two implementations, Socket over TLI/XTI and
    Socket, have different semantics in details but it wouldn't hurt
    the existing applications because the exposed syscall API doesn't
    support socket properties related to such a protocol independent
    application framework.
    
    Fixes #7402.
