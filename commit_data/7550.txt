    http: introduce start of Client and ClientTransport
    
    Much yet to come, but this is a safe first step, introducing
    an in-the-future configurable Client object (where policy for
    cookies, auth, redirects will live) as well as introducing a
    ClientTransport interface for sending requests.
    
    The CL intentionally ignores everything around the creation
    and configuration of Clients and merely ports/wraps the old
    interfaces to/around Client/ClientTransport.
