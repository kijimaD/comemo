commit 8b7ea6489c40f2e54d01836b2fae611c39fb09d4
Author: Marcel van Lohuizen <mpvl@golang.org>

    exp/locale/collate: changed implementation of Compare and CompareString to
    compare incrementally. Also modified collation API to be more high-level
    by removing the need for an explicit buffer to be passed as an argument.
    This considerably speeds up Compare and CompareString.  This change also eliminates
    the need to reinitialize the normalization buffer for each use of an iter. This
    also significantly improves performance for Key and KeyString.
