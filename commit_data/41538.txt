    runtime: print instruction bytes when reporting a SIGILL
    
    Print the bytes of the instruction that generated a SIGILL.
    This should help us respond to bug reports without having to
    go back-and-forth with the reporter to get the instruction involved.
    Might also help with SIGILL problems that are difficult to reproduce.
    
    Update #37513
