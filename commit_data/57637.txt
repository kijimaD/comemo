    syscall, internal/syscall/unix: add Openat support for wasip1
    
    The syscall package is mostly frozen, but wasip1 file syscall
    support was added to syscall and the Open and Openat
    implementations overlap. Implement Openat in syscall for
    overall simplicity.
    
    We already have syscall.Openat for some platforms, so this
    doesn't add any new functions to syscall.
    
    For #67002
