    runtime: add TestIntendedInlining
    
    The intent is to allow more aggressive refactoring
    in the runtime without silent performance changes.
    
    The test would be useful for many functions.
    I've seeded it with the runtime functions tophash and add;
    it will grow organically (or wither!) from here.
    
    Updates #21536 and #17566
