    path: remove filename mentions from pattern godocs
    
    path.Match works purely with strings, not file paths. That's what sets
    it apart from filepath.Match. For example, only filepath.Match will
    change its behavior towards backslashes on Windows, to accomodate for
    the file path separator on that system.
    
    As such, path.Match should make no mention of file names. Nor should
    path.ErrBadPattern mention globbing at all - the package has no notion
    of globbing, and the error concerns only patterns.
    
    For a similar reason, remove the mention of globbing from
    filepath.ErrBadPattern. The error isn't reserved to just globbing, as it
    can be returned from filepath.Match. And, as before, it only concerns
    the patterns themselves.
