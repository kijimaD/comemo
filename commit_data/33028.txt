    archive/tar: ignore ChangeTime and AccessTime unless Format is specified
    
    CL 59230 changed Writer.WriteHeader to ignore the ChangeTime and AccessTime
    fields when considering using the USTAR format when the format is unspecified.
    This policy is confusing and leads to unexpected behavior where some files
    have ModTime only, while others have ModTime+AccessTime+ChangeTime if the
    format became PAX for some unrelated reason (e.g., long pathname).
    
    Change the policy to simply always ignore ChangeTime, AccessTime, and
    sub-second time resolutions unless the user explicitly specifies a format.
    This is a safe policy change since WriteHeader had no support for the
    above features in any Go release.
    
    Support for ChangeTime and AccessTime was added in CL 55570.
    Support for sub-second times was added in CL 55552.
    Both CLs landed after the latest Go release (i.e., Go1.9), which was
    cut from the master branch around August 6th, 2017.
