    math/big: remove NaN support - just not worth it
    
    NaNs make the API more complicated for no real good reasons.
    There are few operations that produce NaNs with IEEE arithmetic,
    there's no need to copy the behavior. It's easy to test for these
    scenarios and avoid them (on the other hand, it's not easy to test
    for overflow or underflow, so we want to keep +/-Inf).
    
    Also:
    - renamed IsNeg -> Signbit (clearer, especially for x == -0)
    - removed IsZero           (Sign() == 0 is sufficient and efficient)
    - removed IsFinite         (now same as !IsInf)
