    cmd/internal/gc, cmd/internal/ld: fixes for global vars of types from other modules
    
    To make the gcprog for global data containing variables of types defined in other shared
    libraries, we need to know a lot about those types. So read the value of any symbol with
    a name starting with "type.". If a type uses a mask, the name of the symbol defining the
    mask unfortunately cannot be predicted from the type name so I have to keep track of the
    addresses of every such symbol and associate them with the type symbols after the fact.
    
    I'm not very happy about this change, but something like this is needed and this is as
    pleasant as I know how to make it.
