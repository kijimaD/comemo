    exp/template/html: Reworked escapeText to recognize attr boundaries.
    
    The following testcases now pass:
    
    `<a href=x` tests that we do not error on partial unquoted attrs.
    `<a href=x ` tests that spaces do end unquoted attrs on spaces.
    `<a href=''` tests that we recognize the end of single quoted attrs.
    `<a href=""` tests that we recognize the end of double quoted attrs.
