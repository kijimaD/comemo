    runtime: put runtime.fastrand back temporarily
    
    Callers should be using math/rand/v2.Uint64 instead,
    but there are lots of linkname references to runtime.fastrand
    in public code. If we break it all now, that will require people
    to use //go:build tags to use rand/v2.Uint64 with Go 1.22
    and keep using the linkname for earlier versions.
    Instead, leave the linkname working and then we can remove
    it in Go 1.24, at which point everyone should be able to use
    math/rand/v2.Uint64 unconditionally.
