commit 95100344d33f7b99cd728260d8e6ee6a19ce0429
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 1 00:26:00 2009 -0700

    fix runtime stack overflow bug that gri ran into:
    160 - 75 was just barely not enough for deferproc + morestack.
    
    added enum names and bumped to 256 - 128.
    added explanation.
    
    changed a few mal() (garbage-collected) to
    malloc()/free() (manually collected).
