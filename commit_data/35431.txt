    cmd/compile: refactor inlining parameters; inline panic
    
    Inlining was refactored to perform tuning experiments,
    with the "knobs" now set to also inline functions/methods
    that include panic(), and -l=4 (inline calls) now expressed
    as a change to costs, rather than scattered if-thens.
    
    The -l=4 inline-calls penalty is chosen to be the best
    found during experiments; it makes some programs much
    larger and slower (notably, the compiler itself) and is
    believed to be risky for machine-generated code in general,
    which is why it is not the default.  It is also not
    well-tested with the debugger and DWARF output.
    
    This change includes an explicit go:noinline applied to the
    method that is the largest cause of compiler binary growth
    and slowdown for midstack inlining; there are others,
    ideally whatever heuristic eventually appears will make
    this unnecessary.
