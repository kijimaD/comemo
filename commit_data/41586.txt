    internal/xcoff: fix wrong bit masking comparisons
    
    I do not know much about xcoff, but this was probably the intended
    behavior. (The comparison is tautologically false, as is.)
    
    Also note: does any other code even depend on the changed code existing?
    Maybe it should just be removed, as I did not find any uses of fields
    that are written to if the branch condition tests true.
