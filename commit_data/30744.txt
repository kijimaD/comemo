    cmd/compile: sort CFG blocks in PC order during liveness
    
    This CL changes the order that liveness analysis visits CFG blocks to
    PC order, rather than RPO. This doesn't meaningfully change anything
    except that the PCDATA_StackMapIndex values will be assigned in PC
    order too.
    
    However, this does have the benefit that the subsequent CL to port
    liveness analysis to the SSA CFG (which has blocks in PC order) will
    now pass toolstash-check.
