    os/exec: document that non-comparable writers may race
    
    The comment for Cmd.Stdout and Cmd.Stderr says that it's safe to
    set both to the same writer, but it doesn't say that this only
    works when both writers are comparable.
    
    This change updates the comment to explain that using a
    non-comparable writer may still lead to a race.
    
    Fixes #19804
