commit 212e074be2bf8be3639250050ce9867d690f7b2c

    time: add AfterFunc to call a function after a given duration.
    The After code is trivially generalisable to provide support
    for this, and it is possible to use AfterFunc to do
    things that After cannot, such as waiting
    for many events at varied times without an overhead
    of one goroutine per event.
