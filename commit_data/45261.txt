    compress/flate: revert a goto for-loop
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/16528, a goto loop was chosen over a regular
    for loop since that would make the function inlinable.
    
    Thanks to the recent https://golang.org/cl/256459, for loops without a
    label can now be inlined. So we can undo the workaround and simplify the
    code.
    
    Also add the function to TestIntendedInlining, which passes both before
    and after the change, as expected.
    
    For #14768.
