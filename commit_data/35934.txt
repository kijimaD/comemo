    cmd/go: add ImportMap to go list package struct
    
    Also populate Imports for test main with go list -test.
    
    Update comment in internal/load/test.go about
    p.Imports, p.Internal.RawImports, and p.Imports
    being perfectly aligned. The first two are,
    but the third is not, as evidenced by CL 111175.
    
    Since p.Imports is not aligned, don't assume that anymore.
    
    Fixes #25949.
