    Revert "cmd/internal/goobj: add index to symbol name for indexed symbols"
    
    This reverts CL 229246.
    
    For new indexed object files, in CL 229246 we added symbol index
    to tools (nm, objdump) output. This affects external tools that
    parse those outputs. And the added index doesn't look very nice.
    In this release we take it out. For future releases we may
    introduce a flag to tools (nm, objdump) and optionally dump the
    symbol index.
    
    For refererenced (not defined) indexed symbols, currently the
    symbol is still referenced only by index, not by name. The next
    CL will make the object file self-contained, so tools can dump
    the symbol names properly (as before).
    
    For #38875.
