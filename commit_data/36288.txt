    cmd/go/internal/modconv: fix TestConvertLegacyConfig expectations
    
    It was a bug to find that commit in the Masterminds/semver repo.
    It's not part of the main repo but only part of an unmerged pull request.
    The code was updated to try not to look at unmerged pull requests,
    but the test was not. Worse, whether the code succeeds at not looking
    at unmerged pull requests apparently depends on the git version.
    Sigh.
    
    Fixes #26754.
    Fixes #27043.
