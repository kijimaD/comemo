    net/http: add protections against misuse of ServeFile
    
    Martin Lenord pointed out that bad patterns have emerged in online
    examples of how to use ServeFile, where people pass r.URL.Path[1:] to
    ServeFile. This is unsafe. Document that it's unsafe, and add some
    protections.
    
    Fixes #14110
