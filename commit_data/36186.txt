    cmd/trace: pprof computation for span types
    
    /spanio, /spanblock, /spansched, /spansyscall provide
    the pprof-style summary of span execution's
    io, block, scheduling, syscall latency distributions
    respectively.
    
    The computation logic for /io, /block, /sched, /syscall
    analysis was refactored and extended for reuse in these
    new types of analysis. Upon the analysis query, we create
    a map of goroutine id to time intervals based on the query
    parameter, that represents the interesting time intervals
    of matching goroutines. Only the events from the matching
    goroutines that fall into the intervals are considered
    in the pprof computation.
    
    The new endpoints are not yet hooked into other span
    analysis page (e.g. /userspan) yet.
