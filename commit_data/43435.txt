    cmd/link: in stack bound check, don't check a call repetitively
    
    In stack bound check pass, check a call once, not over and over
    again. Fix an accidental quadratic behavior...
    
    In particular, switching to the new linker caused MIPS builders
    noticeably slower. This CL fixes it.
