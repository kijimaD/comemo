    cmd/compile: mark closure DUPOK if the outer function is
    
    If a function is DUPOK (e.g. an instantiation of a generic
    function) and contains closures, the closure also needs to be
    DUPOK. Otherwise, when the outer function is included in multiple
    packages, the closure will also be included in these packages, and
    the linker will dedup the outer function but not the closure,
    causing duplicated symbols. In normal builds it is mostly still ok
    as these closure symbols are only referenced by indices. But in
    shared build mode all symbols are named and kept live, causing an
    error.
    
    Should fix the shared build mode.
