    runtime: eliminate poisonStack checks
    
    We haven't used poisonStack since we switched to 1-bit stack maps
    (4d0f3a1), but the checks are still there. However, nothing prevents
    us from genuinely allocating an object at this address on 32-bit and
    causing the runtime to crash claiming that it's found a bad pointer.
    
    Since we're not using poisonStack anyway, just pull it out.
    
    Fixes #15831.
