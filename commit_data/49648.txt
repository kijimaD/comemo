    cmd/compile: workaround inlining of closures with range statements
    
    ORANGE is still not inlineable now. This CL is correct only when the range statement is statically dead, and thus not counted during the inline budget check.
    If we support range statements in inlining closures in the future, may require additional processing.
    
    Fixes #48033.
