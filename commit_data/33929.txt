    runtime: always use 1MB stacks on 32-bit Windows
    
    Commit c2c07c7989 (CL 49331) changed the linker and runtime to always
    use 2MB stacks on 64-bit Windows. This is the corresponding change to
    make 32-bit Windows always use large (1MB) stacks because it's
    difficult to detect when Windows applications will call into arbitrary
    C code that may expect a large stack.
    
    This is done as a separate change because it's possible this will
    cause too much address space pressure for a 32-bit address space. On
    the other hand, cgo binaries on Windows already use 1MB stacks and
    there haven't been complaints.
    
    Updates #20975.
