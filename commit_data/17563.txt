    cmd/api: fix tool for recent go/build change
    
    Asking about runtime/cgo when CgoEnabled=false now correctly
    returns an error from build.Import (specifically, NoGoError), because
    there are no buildable Go files in that directory.
    
    The API tool was depending on it returning a package with no Go
    files instead. Correct that assumption.
    
    Fixes all.bash on local machines.
    (Dashboard appears not to be running the api tool at all.)
    
    Update #6124
