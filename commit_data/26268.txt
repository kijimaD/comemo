    cmd/compile: allow deduplication of long strings
    
    String symbols' names used to appear in the final binary.
    Using a string's contents as it's symbol's name
    was a thus a bad idea if the string's name was long.
    Recent improvements by crawshaw have changed that.
    
    Instead of placing long strings behind opaque names
    in local packages, place them in the global string
    package and make them content-addressable.
    Symbol names still occur in the object files,
    so use a hash to avoid needless length there.
    
    Reduces the size of cmd/go by 30k.
