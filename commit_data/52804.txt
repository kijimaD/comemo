    cmd/compile/internal/escape: escape values with >PtrSize alignment
    
    After CL 381317 there exist values that may have an alignment greater
    than the pointer size for that platform. Specifically, atomic.{Ui|I}nt64
    may be aligned to 8 bytes on a 32-bit platform. If such a value, or
    a container for the value, gets stack-allocated, it's possible that it
    won't be aligned correctly, because the maximum alignment we enforce on
    stacks is governed by the pointer size. Changing that would be a
    significant undertaking, so just escape these values to the heap
    instead, where we're sure they'll actually be aligned correctly.
    
    Change is by rsc@, I'm just shepherding it through code review.
    
    For #50860.
