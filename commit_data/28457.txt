    runtime: unwind BP in jmpdefer to match SP unwind
    
    The irregular calling convention for defers currently incorrectly
    manages the BP if frame pointers are enabled. Specifically, jmpdefer
    manipulates the SP as if its own caller, deferreturn, had returned.
    However, it does not manipulate the BP to match. As a result, when a
    BP-based traceback happens during a deferred function call, it unwinds
    to the function that performed the defer and then thinks that function
    called itself in an infinite regress.
    
    Fix this by making jmpdefer manipulate the BP as if deferreturn had
    actually returned.
    
    Fixes #12968.
    
    Updates #15840.
