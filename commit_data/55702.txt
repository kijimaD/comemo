    cmd/go: make PGO profile path per package
    
    Currently, the PGO profile path is global for a single go command
    invocation, as it applies to all packages being built (or none).
    With -pgo=auto mode with multiple main packages, packages from a
    single go command invocation could have different profiles. So it
    is necessary that the PGO profile path is per package, which is
    this CL does.
    
    For #58099.
