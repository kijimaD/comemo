    [dev.link] cmd/link: remove global datap, moved to *Link
    
    This change moves datap from global space into the link context. Rather
    than having it exist in context, we could have it returned from dodata,
    and pass it as a parameter, but it is used in awkward places in the
    Arch functions. Easiest for now is just keeping it in the context, until
    we more formally move it to slices of loader.Sym.
    
    This is a largely non-functional change.
