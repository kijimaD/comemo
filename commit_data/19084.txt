    cmd/6g: relax constraint on variables that need zeroing.
    
    On amd64p32 pointers are 32-bit-aligned and cannot be assumed to
    have an offset multiple of widthreg. Instead check that they are
    withptr-aligned.
    
    Also change the threshold for region merging to 2*widthreg
    instead of 2*widthptr because performance on amd64 and amd64p32
    is expected to be the same.
    
    Fixes #7712.
