    math/big: add more Float.Float64 conversion tests
    
    - structure the Float64 conversion tests the same way as for Float32
    - add additional test cases, including one that exposes a current issue
      (currently disabled, same issue as was fixed for Float32)
    
    The Float64 fix will be in a subsequent change for easier reviewing.
