    crypto/tls: check curve equation in ECDHE.
    
    This change causes a TLS client and server to verify that received
    elliptic curve points are on the expected curve. This isn't actually
    necessary in the Go TLS stack, but Watson Ladd has convinced me that
    it's worthwhile because it's pretty cheap and it removes the
    possibility that some change in the future (e.g. tls-unique) will
    depend on it without the author checking that precondition.
