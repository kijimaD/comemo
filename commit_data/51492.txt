    go/types, types2: fix bug in types2.MissingMethod
    
    Because Checker.missingMethod also looks up methods matching
    matching case-folded names, when Checker.missingMethod returns
    an alternative method, that method does not automatically have
    the wrong type. It may be a method with a different name.
    
    Adjust types2.MissingMethod to check the alternative method
    name before reporting a wrong type.
    
    Add API test that verifies (now correct) behavior for this
    case.
    
    Ported the code also to go/types, though it was not a bug
    there yet because looking up with case-folding is not yet
    enabled.
