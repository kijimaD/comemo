    runtime: no SIGWINCH to pgrp while GDB is running
    
    When run with stdin == /dev/null and stdout/stderr == pipe (i.e., as
    os/exec.Command.CombinedOutput), GDB suffers from a bug
    (https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26056) that causes
    SIGSEGV when sent a SIGWINCH signal.
    
    Package runtime tests TestEINTR and TestSignalDuringExec both send
    SIGWINCH signals to the entire process group, thus including GDB if one
    of the GDB tests is running in parallel.
    
    TestEINTR only intends its signals for the current process, so it is
    changed to do so. TestSignalDuringExec, really does want its signals to
    go to children. However, it does not call t.Parallel(), so it won't run
    at the same time as GDB tests.
    
    This is a simple fix, but GDB is vulnerable, so we must be careful not
    to add new parallel tests that send SIGWINCH to the entire process
    group.
    
    Fixes #39021
