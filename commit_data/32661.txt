    crypto/x509: get hash information from signatureAlgorithmDetails and check that it matches
    
    signatureAlgorithmDetails already knows the hash function for each
    signature algorithm so there's no point in duplicating that. Also, check
    that the public key type of the signature algorithm actually matches the
    given public key.
