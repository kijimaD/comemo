 Why does Go not have generic types?</h3>
 <p>
-Generics may well be added at some point.  We don't feel an urgency for
-them, although we understand some programmers do.
+A <a href="https://golang.org/issue/43651">language proposal
+implementing a form of generic types</a> has been accepted for
+inclusion in the language.
+If all goes well it will be available in the Go 1.18 release.
