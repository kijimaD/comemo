    cmd/compile: drop "buildcfg" from no instrument packages
    
    Package buildcfg was added to this list by CL 403851, but package
    buildcfg does not exist.
    
    This was probably intended to refer to internal/buildcfg, but
    internal/buildcfg is only used by the compiler so it is not clear why it
    couldn't be instrumented.
    
    For #44853.
