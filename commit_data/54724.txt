    cmd/go/internal/load: remove a special case for "unsafe"
    
    We had a special case to zero out the Target field for package
    "unsafe", which is not imported from a normal object file.
    
    As of CL 449376 that special case has been folded into go/build's
    logic for setting the PkgObj field, so the special case in
    cmd/go/internal/load has become redundant.
    
    (Noticed while investigating CL 449376.)
    
    Updates #47257.
    Updates #56687.
