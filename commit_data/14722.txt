    cmd/gc: fix wrong interaction between inlining and embedded builtins.
    
    The patch makes the compile user an ordinary package-local
    symbol for the name of embedded fields of builtin type.
    
    This is incompatible with the fix delivered for issue 2687
    (revision 3c060add43fb) but fixes it in a different way, because
    the explicit symbol on the field makes the typechecker able to
    find it in lookdot.
    
    Fixes #3552.
