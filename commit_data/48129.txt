    runtime: simplify histogram buckets considerably
    
    There was an off-by-one error in the time histogram buckets calculation
    that caused the linear sub-buckets distances to be off by 2x.
    
    The fix was trivial, but in writing tests I realized there was a much
    simpler way to express the calculation for the histogram buckets, and
    took the opportunity to do that here. The new bucket calculation also
    fixes the bug.
    
    Fixes #50732.
