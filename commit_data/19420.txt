    spec: specify order of init() calls
    
    The spec did not specify the order in which
    init() functions are called. Specify that
    they are called in source order since we have
    now also specified the initialization order
    of independent variables.
    
    While technically a language change, no
    existing code could have relied on this,
    so this should not break anything.
    
    Per suggestion from rsc.
