    cmd/dist: do not rewrite files that already have the correct content
    
    In particular, this avoids moving the mtime on runtime/zversion.go
    forward unless the file is out of date. In turn, this makes cross compiles
    that run dist multiple times coexist nicely.
    
    (It's no longer necessary to run dist multiple times to set up cross compiles,
    but people still might, and it's easy to fix regardless.)
    
    Fixes #4749.
