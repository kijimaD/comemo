    cmd/dist: support building on debian/kFreeBSD
    
    The debian/kFreeBSD project uses the FreeBSD kernel and the debian userspace. From our point of view, this is freebsd not linux as GOOS talks about the kernel syscall interface, not the userspace (although cgo alters that). As debian/kFreeBSD is experimental at this time, I do not think it is worth the effort of duplicating all the freebsd specific code so this is proposal represents a reasonable workaround.
    
    Currently cgo is not supported, make.bash will detect this and disable cgo automatically during the build.
