    os: fix aliasing bug in RemoveAllTestHook restoration
    
    The code to swap RemoveAllTestHook in and out in
    TestRemoveAllWithMoreErrorThanReqSize was making a copy of the
    RemoveAllTestHook pointer, then attempting to restore by loading from
    the copy of that pointer. Since the two copies of the pointer aliased
    the same address, the restore operation had no effect, and any
    RemoveAll tests that happened to run after
    TestRemoveAllWithMoreErrorThanReqSize would fail.
    
    Fixes #31421
