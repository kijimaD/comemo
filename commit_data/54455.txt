    net/http: ServeMux handles extended patterns
    
    Modify ServeMux to handle patterns with methods and wildcards.
    
    Remove the map and list of patterns. Instead patterns
    are registered and matched using a routing tree.
    
    We also reorganize the code around "trailing-slash redirection,"
    the feature whereby a trailing slash is added to a path
    if it doesn't match an existing one. The existing code
    checked the map of paths twice, but searching the tree
    twice would be needlessly expensive. The rewrite
    searches the tree once, and then again only if a
    trailing-slash redirection is possible.
    
    There are a few omitted features in this CL, indicated
    with TODOs.
