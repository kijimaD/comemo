    net/http: treat MaxBytesReader's negative limits as equivalent to zero limit
    
    Current MaxBytesReader behaviour differs from its documentation. It's
    not similar enough to io.LimitReader. It panics when limit (n) < -1 and
    returns [-1, <nil>] when limit (n) = -1. To fix that, we treat all
    negative limits as equivalent to 0.
    
    It would be possible to make MaxBytesReader analogically identical in
    behaviour to io.LimitReader, but that would require to stop
    maxBytesReader's Read from reading past the limit. Read always reads one
    more byte (if possible) for non-negative limits and returns a non-EOF
    error. This behaviour will now apply to all limits.
    
    Fixes #45101
