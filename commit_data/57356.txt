    crypto/aes: Avo port of gcm_amd64.s
    
    This implementation utilizes the same registers found in the reference
    implementation, aiming to produce a minimal semantic diff between the
    Avo-generated output and the original hand-written assembly.
    
    To verify the Avo implementation, the reference and Avo-generated
    assembly files are fed to `go tool asm`, capturing the debug output into
    corresponding temp files. The debug output contains supplementary
    metadata (line numbers, instruction offsets, and source file references)
    that must be removed in order to obtain a semantic diff of the two
    files. This is accomplished via a small utility script written in awk.
    
    The reference assembly file does not specify a frame size for some of
    the defined assembly functions. Avo automatically infers the frame size
    when generating TEXT directives, leading to a diff on those lines. Some
    metadata not included in the reference assembly has also been added,
    which leads to a diff in the lines where that parameter symbol is
    referenced.
    
    Commands used to verify Avo output:
    
    GOROOT=$(go env GOROOT)
    ASM_PATH="src/crypto/aes/gcm_amd64.s"
    REFERENCE="54fe0fd43fcf8609666c16ae6d15ed92873b1564"
    
    go tool asm -o /dev/null -I "$GOROOT"/src/runtime -debug \
      <(git cat-file -p "$REFERENCE:$ASM_PATH") \
      > /tmp/reference.s
    
    go tool asm -o /dev/null -I "$GOROOT"/src/runtime -debug \
      "$ASM_PATH" \
      > /tmp/avo.s
    
    normalize(){
      awk '{
        $1=$2=$3="";
        print substr($0,4)
      }'
    }
    
    diff <(normalize < /tmp/reference.s) <(normalize < /tmp/avo.s)
