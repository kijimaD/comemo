    cmd/gofmt: clarify doc string even more
    
    Since "columns of alignment" are terminated whenever indentation
    changes from one line to the next, alignment with spaces will work
    independent of the actually chosen tab width. Don't mention tab width

    Follow-up on https://golang.org/cl/38374/.
    
    For #19618.

 Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input.  Given a file,
