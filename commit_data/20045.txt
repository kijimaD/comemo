    runtime: always pass type to mallocgc when allocating scannable memory
    We allocate scannable memory w/o type only in few places in runtime.
    All these cases are not-performance critical (e.g. G or finq args buffer),
    and in long term they all need to go away.
    It's not worth it to have special code for this case in mallocgc.
    So use special fake "notype" type for such allocations.
