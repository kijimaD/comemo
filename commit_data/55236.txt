    cmd/asm: print absolute PC for all patterns "off(PC)" in testEndToEnd
    
    Before this CL, testEndToEnd only turns the relative PC to absolute PC
    when pattern "off(PC)" is the suffix of an instruction. But there are
    some instructions like:
    
      ADR 10(PC), R10
    
    it's also acceptable for the assembler while the pattern "off(PC)" is
    not a suffix, which makes the test fail.
    
    This CL fixes this issue by searching the pattern in the whole string
    instead of only in the suffix.
