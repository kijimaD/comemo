    cmd/link/internal/loadpe: handle _main reference properly
    
    When building CGO internal linking on windows 386, make sure to avoid
    rewriting references to "_main" to "main" when reading symbols during
    host object loading; the main routine defined by the Go runtime is
    still named "_main" (not "main"). If we don't do this, we wind up with
    an SXREF symbol named "main", which can then cause the loader to pull
    an actual "main" symbol out of a host archive, which is undesirable.
    
    Updates #35006.
