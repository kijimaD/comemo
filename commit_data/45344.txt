    cmd/go/internal/modload: use (*loadPkg).mod only to indicate the module from which the package was loaded
    
    The (*loadPkg).mod field normally indicates the module from which the
    package was loaded. However, if the package was missing, we previously
    used the mod field to instead store the module from which we intend to
    load the package next time around.
    
    That sort of dual use makes the semantics (and synchronization) of the
    mod field much more complex to reason about. For example, it would be
    nice to have the invariant that the mod field is always one of the
    modules in the overall build list, or one of the modules selected in
    the overall module graph. Similarly, it would be nice to have the
    invariant that the version indicated by the mod field can coexist with
    (without upgrading) all of the other versions indicated in the mod
    fields of other packages.
    
    This repurposing of the mod field appears to be solely in the service
    of storing the module when resolving missing imports. To keep
    conceptually-separate fields separate, I have changed
    resolveMissingImports to store a slice of packageâ€“module pairs,
    instead of just packages that need to be revisited.
    
    This may increase allocation pressure slightly if we have many
    unresolved packages, but most packages are not unresolved, and it
    seems worth the cost to use a little extra memory if it means we can
    reason more clearly about the (quite complex) behaviors of the module
    loader.
    
    For #36460
