    compress/lzw: fix comment re high-code invariant
    
    The listed invariant, while technically true, was misleading, and the
    invariant can be tightened. We never actually get to (d.hi ==
    d.overflow), due to the "d.hi--" line in the decoder.decode method.
    
    This is a comment-only commit, changing the comment to match the code.
    
    A follow-up commit could restore the comment, changing the code to match
    the original intented invariant. But the first step is to have the
    comment and the code say the same thing.
