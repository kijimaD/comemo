    cmd/internal/objfile: reuse tabwriter across symbols when disassembling
    
    Since the tabwriter is flushed at every symbol,
    it can be re-used with no impact on the output.
    
    This cuts allocated space when objdump-ing
    the compiler by almost 40%,
    and enables further upcoming improvements.
    
    It also speeds up objdump.
