    encoding/gob: document behavior of zero-valued arrays, slices, and maps
    
    The documentation was inconsistent. It said zero values were not sent, but
    that zero-valued elements of arrays and arrays were sent. But which rule
    applies if the array is all zero elements, and is therefore itself a zero value?
    
    The answer is: the array is transmitted. In principle the other choice could
    be made, but there would be considerable expense and complexity required
    to implement this behavior now, not to mention worries about changes of
    behavior.
    
    Therefore we just document the situation: Arrays, slices, and maps are
    always encoded. It would perhaps be nice to have sorted this out earlier,
    but it was a missed opportunity.
    
    Fixes #13378
