    net/http: deflake TestServerTimeouts maybe
    
    I haven't been able to reproduce this one, but change a few suspect
    things in this test. Notably, using the global "Get" function and thus
    using the DefaultTransport was buggy in a parallel test. Then add some error
    checks and close a TCP connection.
    
    Hopefully the failure wasn't timing-related.
    
    Fixes #18036 (I hope)
