    cmd/link: eliminate markextra
    
    This appears to be leftover from when instruction selection happened
    in the linker. Many of the morestackX functions listed don't even
    exist anymore.
    
    Now that we select instructions within the compiler and assembler,
    normal deadcode elimination mechanisms should suffice for these
    symbols.
