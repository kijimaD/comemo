    misc/cgo/test/issue9400: fix to build with gccgo
    
    This doesn't test much with gccgo, but at least it builds now, and the
    test does, unsurprisingly, pass.  A proper test would require adding
    assembly files in GCC syntax for all platforms that gccgo supports,
    which would be infeasible.
    
    Also added copyright headers to the asm files.
