commit 92261b38638af61a3aae2fdc48fd0b9f0cbff096
Author: Dmitri Shuralyov <dmitshur@golang.org>

    run.bash: drop 'export GOROOT' and its obsolete comment
    
    The comment justifies exporting GOROOT by saying the api test needs it,
    which was relevant back when it was added in CL 99870043, but isn't true
    by now.
    
    As of Go 1.8, GOPATH can be unset (https://go.dev/doc/go1.8#gopath).
    At some point it also became okay to leave GOROOT unset, at least
    whenever one is looking to use the default GOROOT tree of the go command
    being executed and not intentionally changing it to a custom directory.
    
    It's also not there in the .bat and .rc variants of this script.
    Drop it.
