    cmd/vet: honor analyzer flags when running vet outside $GOROOT/src
    
    Additional vet flags specified by user are discarded if 'go vet'
    is invoked outside $GOROOT/src to check a package under $GOROOT
    (including those under "vendor" of $GOROOT), fix it by avoiding the
    overwriting, the logic of detemining if the package under vetting
    comes from $GOROOT remains untouched.
    
    Also checked 'go tool vet <options> <cfg>' and 'go vet <options>
    <user pkg>', both worked w./w.o this fix.
    
    Fixes #35837.
