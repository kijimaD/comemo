    cmd/link: always mark runtime.unreachableMethod symbol
    
    In the deadcode path we mark runtime.unreachableMethod symbol,
    which is a special symbol used for redirecting unreachable
    methods. Currently this code is conditioned on not -linkshared.
    This is wrong. It should be marked with -linkshared mode as well.
    
    In fact, -linkshared should only affect the entry symbol. Change
    the code accordingly.
