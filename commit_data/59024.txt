    cmd/compile: use min & max builtins to assert constant bounds in prove's tests
    
    I've originally used |= and &= to setup assumptions exploitable by the
    operation under test but theses have multiple issues making it poor
    for this usecase:
    - &= does not pass the minimum value as-is, rather always set it to 0
    - |= rounds up the max value to a number of the same length with all ones set
    - I've never implemented them to work with negative signed numbers
