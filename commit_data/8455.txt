commit f4fe688b0983077cffe5baf8f4f62dfe196bffe9
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    flags: allow distinct sets of flags.
    
    A FlagSet is an independent set of flags that may be used,
    for example, to provide flag processing for subcommands
    in a CLI.  The standard, os.Args-derived set of flags is a
    global but non-exported FlagSet and the standard functions
    are wrappers for methods of that FlagSet.
    
    Allow the programmer to control whether the program
    exits if there is a parse error.  For the default set, the behavior
    remains to exit on error.
    
    The handling of Usage is odd due to backward compatibility.
