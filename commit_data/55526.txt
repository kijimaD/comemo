    dog/go1.22: tweak coverage testing notes
    
    Clarify the section in the "go" command notes that deals with the
    changes to "go test -cover" for packages without tests, adding a note
    that if a package has not tests and no executable code, you still get
    a "package has no test files" diagnostic.
    
    Fixes #65262.
