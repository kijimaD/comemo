    cmd/dist: add liblink build information
    
    In addition to adding the library, change the way the anames array is created.
    Previously, it was written to src/cmd/6l/enam.c (and similarly for 5l and 8l)
    and each of the other tools (6g, 6c, 6a) compiled the 6l/enam.c file in addition
    to their own sources.
    
    Now that there is a library shared by all these programs, move the anames
    array into that library. To eliminate name conflicts, name the array after
    the architecture letter: anames5, anames6, anames8.
    
    First step to linker cleanup (golang.org/s/go13linker).
    
    This CL does not build by itself. It depends on the CLs introducing
    liblink and changing commands to use it.
