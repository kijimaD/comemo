    crypto/tls: add server side SNI support.
    
    With this in place, a TLS server is capable of selecting the correct
    certificate based on the client's ServerNameIndication extension.
    
    The need to call Config.BuildNameToCertificate is unfortunate, but
    adding a sync.Once to the Config structure made it uncopyable and I
    felt that was too high a price to pay. Parsing the leaf certificates
    in each handshake was too inefficient to consider.
