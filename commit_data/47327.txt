    testing/fstest: clarify TestFS docs
    
    The sentence starts "fsys must only contain",
    which leads the reader to believe that fsys must not contain others.
    The rapid reversal leads to confusion.
    I had to read it several times to be sure I'd parsed it correctly.
    
    Remove "only"; rely on the rest of the sentence to clarify.
