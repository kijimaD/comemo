    [dev.boringcrypto] cmd/compile: by default accept any language
    
    The bootstrap stage 1 compiler was defaulting to the language version
    used by the bootstrap compiler itself, typically 1.4. Normally this
    doesn't matter since the bootstrap code has to build with 1.4 anyhow,
    but it broke the boringcrypto branch which uses cgo during the
    bootstrap, as cgo now generates code that uses type aliases.
