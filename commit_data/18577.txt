    cmd/gc, runtime: enable precisestack by default
    
    [Repeat of CL 64100044, after 32-bit fix in CL 66170043.]
    
    Precisestack makes stack collection completely precise,
    in the sense that there are no "used and not set" errors
    in the collection of stack frames, no times where the collector
    reads a pointer from a stack word that has not actually been
    initialized with a pointer (possibly a nil pointer) in that function.
    
    The most important part is interfaces: precisestack means
    that if reading an interface value, the interface value is guaranteed
    to be initialized, meaning that the type word can be relied
    upon to be either nil or a valid interface type word describing
    the data word.
    
    This requires additional zeroing of certain values on the stack
    on entry, which right now costs about 5% overall execution
    time in all.bash. That cost will come down before Go 1.3
    (issue 7345).
    
    There are at least two known garbage collector bugs right now,
    issues 7343 and 7344. The first happens even without precisestack.
    The second I have only seen with precisestack, but that does not
    mean that precisestack is what causes it. In fact it is very difficult
    to explain by what precisestack does directly. Precisestack may
    be exacerbating an existing problem. Both of those issues are
    marked for Go 1.3 as well.
    
    The reasons for enabling precisestack now are to give it more
    time to soak and because the copying stack work depends on it.
