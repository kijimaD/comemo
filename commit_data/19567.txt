commit 7dcbf4f353a724091a6f1fc4e760753d3adecd2b
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 18 10:57:18 2014 -0700

    fmt: include Â±Inf and NaN in the complex format test
    Just to be more thorough.
    No need to push this to 1.3; it's just a test change that
    worked without any changes to the code being tested.
