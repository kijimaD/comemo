    runtime: fix final stack split in exitsyscall
    
    exitsyscall should be recursively nosplit, but we don't have a way to
    annotate that right now (see #21314). There's exactly one remaining
    place where this is violated right now: exitsyscall -> casgstatus ->
    print. The other prints in casgstatus are wrapped in systemstack
    calls. This fixes the remaining print.
    
    Updates #21431 (in theory could fix it, but that would just indicate
    that we have a different G status-related crash and we've *never* seen
    that failure on the dashboard.)
