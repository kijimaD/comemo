    runtime: add partial lock order between mspanSpecial and gcBitsArenas
    
    CL 493275 started using gcBits for pinner bits. This means gcBits can be
    allocated while holding the mspanSpecial lock. This is safe because
    these were just parallel in the partial order, but now they need an
    explicit edge between them.
    
    For #58277.
