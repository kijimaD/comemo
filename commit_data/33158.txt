    cmd/compile: distinguish args and return values in DWARF
    
    Set DW_AT_variable_parameter on DW_TAG_formal_parameters that are
    actually return values. variable_parameter is supposed to indicate inout
    parameters, but Go doesn't really have those, and DWARF doesn't have
    explicit support for multiple return values. This seems to be the best
    compromise, especially since the implementation of the two is very
    similar -- both are stack slots.
    
    Fixes #21100
