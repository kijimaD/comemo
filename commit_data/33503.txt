    cmd/vet: don't warn on escaped newlines in Println
    
    The old code only worked for double-quoted strings, and only checked
    that the end of the literal value was \n". This worked most of the time,
    except for some strings like "foo\\n", which doesn't actually translate
    into a trailing newline when unquoted.
    
    To fix this, unquote the string first and look for a real newline at the
    end of it. Ignore errors, as we don't have anything to do with string
    literals using back quotes.
    
    Fixes #22613.
