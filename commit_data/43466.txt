    cmd/go: don't import requirements into existing go.mod files
    
    Previously, if a go.mod file was present, and it only contained a
    module directive, any module-aware command would attempt to import
    requirements from a vendor configuration file like Gopkg.lock.
    
    This CL removes that functionality. It was undocumented and untested,
    and it can cause problems with -mod=readonly. It should never come up
    for go.mod files created with 'go mod init', since they have a "go"
    directive.
    
    For #40278
