    log/slog: clarify the limits of TextHandler output parseability
    
    Give an example illustrating the problem with dots inside groups
    or keys. Clarify that to fix it in general, you need to do more
    than escape the keys, since that won't distinguish the group "a.b"
    from the two groups "a" and "b".
    
    Updates #56345.
