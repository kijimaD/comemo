    cmd/go/testdata/script: skip EndSequence entries in build_trimpath_cgo
    
    The TestScript/build_trimpath_cgo test for cmd/go has been accessing a
    nil pointer when it tries to look up LineEntry.File.Name on a line entry
    with EndSequence set to true. The doc for EndSequence specifies that if
    EndSequence is set, only it and the Address field are meaningful. Skip
    the entries with EndSequence set when building the set of files.
    
    Fixes #70669
