    cmd/compile: add test generator for control and data flow
    
    From a compact specification of control flow graphs,
    generate complete set of possible assignment patterns to
    output y, and also generate an interpretable specification.
    Compiles (hoping for crash, or not) and then runs, where
    the run checks function output against interpreted output
    for various inputs observed to terminate in the interpreter.
    
    In ssa_test.go, added ability to generate a test and run
    (compile and run) the generated test, possibly with
    modified environment variables.  The generated test is
    compiled including the -D=ssa/check/on flag, and if the
    interpreter terminates in a small number of steps, then it
    is also run to check the result.
