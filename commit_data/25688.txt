    runtime: remove redundant empty function call from Breakpoint on arm
    
    CL 18964 included an extra patch (sorry, my first experience of
    git-codereview) which defined the conventional breakpoint instruction
    used by Plan 9 on arm, but also introduced a benign but unneeded
    call to runtime.emptyfunc.  This CL removes the redundant call again.
    
    This completes the series of CLs which add support for Plan 9 on arm.
