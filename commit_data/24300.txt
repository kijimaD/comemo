    crypto/elliptic: call IsOnCurve via the interface.
    
    https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2421/ contains an unfortunate
    slip where IsOnCurve is called on the CurveParams rather than the curve.
    This doesn't really matter, but it's a pain for people doing tricks with
    crypto/elliptic and means that 1.5 would be a regression for them
    without this change.
