    cmd/compile: update default ABI choices for calls and bodyless fn stack maps
    
    After recent discussion about bodyless functions, their wrappers,
    their stack maps, nosplit, and callbacks, I was inspired to go and
    be sure that more defaults were sensible.  This may not be all --
    currently rtcall is "ABIDefault" which I think is correct, but I
    am not 100% certain.
    
    Updates #40724.
