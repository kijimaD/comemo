    net/http: more HTTP/2 tests and fixes
    
    This compares the behavior of server handlers and the net/http
    Transport in both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 mode and verifies they're the
    same.
    
    This also moves some client<->server tests into clientserver_test.go.
    Many of them were in serve_test.go or transport_test.go but were
    basically testing both.
    
    h2_bundle.go is an update of the golang.org/x/net/http2 code
    from https://golang.org/cl/17204 (x/net git rev c745c36eab10)
    
    Fixes #13315
    Fixes #13316
    Fixes #13317
    Fixes other stuff found in the process too
    Updates #6891 (http2 support in general)
