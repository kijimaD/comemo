    cmd/asm,cmd/compile: support 5 operand RLWNM/RLWMI on ppc64
    
    These instructions are actually 5 argument opcodes as specified
    by the ISA.  Prior to this patch, the MB and ME arguments were
    merged into a single bitmask operand to workaround the limitations
    of the ppc64 assembler backend.
    
    This limitation no longer exists. Thus, we can pass operands for
    these opcodes without having to merge the MB and ME arguments in
    the assembler frontend or compiler backend.
    
    Likewise, support for 4 operand variants is unchanged.
