-Perhaps more important is that some discrepancies between the
-architectures in how the PC and SP are handled have been
-eliminated.
-Sometimes these registers represented hardware
-registers, and sometimes pseudo-registers.
-As of Go 1.5, the names <code>PC</code> and <code>SP</code>
-are always pseudo-registers.
-To refer to the hardware register, use the alternate representation such
-as <code>R13</code> for the stack pointer and
-<code>R15</code> for the hardware program counter on x86.
-(The names are different on other architectures.)
-To help enforce this change, references to the
-<code>SP</code> and <code>PC</code>
-pseudo-registers now always require an identifier:
-<code>f+4(SP)</code> not <code>4(SP)</code>;
-it is a syntax error to omit the identifier.
-Uses of <code>SP</code> (say) as a hardware register
-tend to omit the name, and they will now be flagged by
-the assembler.
+Perhaps more important is that on machines where
+<code>SP</code> or <code>PC</code> is only an alias
+for a numbered register,
+such as <code>R13</code> for the stack pointer and
+<code>R15</code> for the hardware program counter
+on x86,
+a reference to such a register that does not include a symbol
+is now illegal.
+For example, <code>SP</code> and <code>4(SP)</code> are
+illegal but <code>sym+4(SP)</code> is fine.
+On such machines, to refer to the hardware register use its
+true <code>R</code> name.
