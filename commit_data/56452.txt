    syscall,internal/poll: move pipe check from syscall.Seek to callers
    
    On Windows, syscall.Seek is a thin wrapper over SetFilePointerEx [1],
    which does not work on pipes, although it doesn't return an error on
    that case. To avoid this undefined behavior, Seek defensively
    calls GetFileType and errors if the type is FILE_TYPE_PIPE.
    
    The problem with this approach is that Seek is a low level
    foundational function that can be called many times for the same file,
    and the additional cgo call (GetFileType) will artificially slow
    down seek operations. I've seen GetFileType to account for 10% of cpu
    time in seek-intensive workloads.
    
    A better approach, implemented in this CL, would be to move the check
    one level up, where many times the file type is already known so the
    GetFileType is unnecessary.
    
    The drawback is that syscall.Seek has had this behavior since pipes
    where first introduced to Windows in
    https://codereview.appspot.com/1715046 and someone could be relying on
    it. On the other hand, this behavior is not documented, so we couldn't
    be breaking any contract.
