commit 4ee934ad27dcd2fb0c28798cb329841a2a444fb1

    cmd/compile: remove references to *os.File from ssa package
    
    This reduces the size of the ssa export data
    by 10%, from 76154 to 67886.
    
    It doesn't appear that #20084, which would do this automatically,
    is going to be fixed soon. Do it manually for now.
    
    This speeds up compiling cmd/compile/internal/amd64
    and presumably its comrades as well:
