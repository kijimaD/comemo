    cmd/cgo/internal/testsanitizers: build on all platforms
    
    This test package uses the Pdeathsig field of syscall.SysProcAttr,
    which is only available on a few platforms. Currently, dist test
    checks for compatible platforms and only registers it as part of
    all.bash on platforms where it can build. But this doesn't help if
    you're just trying to type check everything in cmd.
    
    Make this package pass type checking by moving the condition from dist
    into build tags on the test package itself.
    
    For #60164.
    Updates #37486.
