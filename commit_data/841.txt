commit 57b34617e0f5facc34e43dfdf75fc7e2e0317e3e
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 10 12:45:44 2008 -0700

    - Fixed bug in spec: PrimaryExpr is too restrictive in most places
    (for instance *p was not allowed on the left side of "="). Changed
    to Expression everywhere (this is too liberal, UnaryExpr is probably
    good enough, but it seems funny, and we need to check semantically
    anyway). This matches 6g yacc.
    - Write expression syntac recursively to express evaluation order
    and precedence syntactically.
    - Organized open issues list, folded in stuff from todo.txt which
    is now obsolete.
