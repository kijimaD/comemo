    cmd/link: add Minalign field to ld.Arch
    
    The new Minalign field sets the minimum alignment for all symbols.
    This is required for the upcoming s390x port which requires symbols
    be 2-byte aligned for efficient relative addressing.
    
    All preexisting architectures have Minalign set to 1 which means
    that this commit should have no effect.
    
    I tested values of 2, 4 and 8 on linux amd64 and the tests appear to
    pass. Increasing Minalign to 16 appears to break the runtime. I
    think this is due to assumptions made about the layout of module
    data.
    
    toolstash -cmp on linux amd64 shows no changes due to this commit.
    
    Resolves #14604
