    crypto/dsa: don't allow signing with degenerate private keys to loop forever.
    
    Previously it was possible to craft a DSA private key that would cause
    Sign() to loop forever because no signature could be valid. This change
    does some basic sanity checks and ensures that Sign will always
    terminate.
    
    Thanks to Yolan Romailler for highing this.
    
    Be aware, however, that it's still possible for an attacker to simply
    craft a private key with enormous values and thus cause Sign to take an
    arbitrary amount of time.
