    test: eliminate use of Perl in test/fixedbugs/bug248.go
    
    This change enables bug248 to be tested with Go code.
    For that, it adds a flag -1 to error check and run directory
    with one package failing compilation prior the last package
    which should be run.
    
    Specifically, the "p" package in bug1.go file was renamed into "q"
    to compile them in separate steps,
    bug2.go and bug3.go files were reordered,
    bug2.go was changed into non-main package.
    
    Updates #25586.
