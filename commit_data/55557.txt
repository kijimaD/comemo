    runtime: traceback: include pc=0x%x for inline frames
    
    Crash monitoring tools may parse the PC values and feed them
    to CallersFrames, which does not run the inline unwinder, since
    Callers already did so. So, the GOTRACEBACK=system output
    must also include PC values even for inlined frames.
    (The actual values are just marker NOP instructions,
    but that isn't important.)
    
    This CL also includes a test that the PC values can be
    parsed out of the crash report and fed to CallersFrames
    to yield a sensible result. (The logic is a distillation
    of the x/telemetry crashmonitor.)
    
    The previously printed PCs were in fact slightly wrong
    for frames containing inlined calls: instead of the
    virtual CALL instruction (a NOP) to the first
    inlined call, it would display the PC of the
    CALL in the innermost inlined function.
