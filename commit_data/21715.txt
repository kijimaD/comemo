    cmd/dist: respect runtime.NumCPU when bootstrapping arm hosts
    
    This is a reproposal of CL 2957. This reproposal restricts the
    scope of this change to just arm systems.
    
    With respect to rsc's comments on 2957, on all my arm hosts they perform
    the build significantly faster with this change in place.
