commit 4289bd365c38a44db091396873050cab3cfa8098

    runtime: simply user throws, expand runtime throws
    
    This gives explicit names to the possible states of throwing (-1, 0, 1).
    
    m.throwing is now one of:
    
    throwTypeOff: not throwing, previously == 0
    throwTypeUser: user throw, previously == -1
    throwTypeRuntime: runtime throw, previously == 1
    
    For runtime throws, we now always include frame metadata and system
    goroutines regardless of GOTRACEBACK to aid in debugging the runtime.
    
    For user throws, we no longer include frame metadata or runtime frames,
    unless GOTRACEBACK=system or higher.
    
    For #51485.
