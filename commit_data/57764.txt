    image: add a security considerations section to package doc
    
    Internally the security model for the image package has always been,
    if you don't call DecodeConfig before Decode, you cannot complain if
    Decode attempts to create an arbitrarily large image (with the
    assumption that DecodeConfig would've told you this information). This
    should be explicitly documented.
