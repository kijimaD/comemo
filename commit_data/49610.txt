    misc/cgo/testcarchive: don't rely on an erroneous install target in tests
    
    Non-main packages in module mode should not be installed to
    GOPATH/pkg, but due to #37015 they were installed there anyway.
    
    This change switches the 'go install' command in TestPIE to instead
    use 'go build', and switches TestInstall and TestCachedInstall
    (which appear to be explicitly testing 'go install') to explicitly
    request GOPATH mode (which does have a well-defined install target).
    
    For #37015.
