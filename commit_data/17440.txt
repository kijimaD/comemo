    net: add addrList
    
    This CL adds a new type addrList that will carry a short list of IP
    addresses to dial helper functions in the upcoming CLs.
    
    This is in preparation for TCP connection setup with fast failover on
    dual IP stack node as described in RFC 6555.
    
    Update #3610
    Update #5267
