    runtime: test that periodic GC works
    
    We've broken periodic GC a few times without noticing because there's
    no test for it, partly because you have to wait two minutes to see if
    it happens. This exposes control of the periodic GC timeout to runtime
    tests and adds a test that cranks it down to zero and sleeps for a bit
    to make sure periodic GCs happen.
