    runtime: add Benchmark[Clear|Copy]Fat[16|24]
    
    These benchmarks are important for performance. When compiling the stdlib:
    
    * 77.1% of the calls to sgen (copyfat) are for 16 bytes; another 8.7% are for 24 bytes. (The next most common is 32 bytes, at 5.7%.)
    * Over half the calls to clearfat are for 16 or 24 bytes.
