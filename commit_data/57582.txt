    test: fix test issue 69434 for riscv64
    
    CL 615915 simplified test for issue 69434, using gcflags maymorestack to
    force stack moving, making program failed with invalid stack pointer.
    
    However, it seems that this maymorestack is broken on riscv64. At least
    gotip-linux-riscv64 is currently broken.
    
    This CL fixes this problem by using the initial approach, growing stack
    size big enough to force stack moving.
    
    Updates #69434
    Fixes #69714
