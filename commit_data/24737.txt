    runtime: account mark worker time before gcMarkDone
    
    Currently gcMarkDone takes basically no time, so it's okay to account
    the worker time after calling it. However, gcMarkDone is about to take
    potentially *much* longer because it may perform all of mark
    termination. Prepare for this by swapping the order so we account the
    time before calling gcMarkDone.
