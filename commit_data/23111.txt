    cmd/8l, cmd/internal/ld, cmd/internal/obj/x86: stop incorrectly using the term "inital exec"
    
    The long comment block in obj6.go:progedit talked about the two code sequences
    for accessing g as "local exec" and "initial exec", but really they are both forms
    of local exec. This stuff is confusing enough without using the wrong words for
    things, so rewrite it to talk about 2-instruction and 1-instruction sequences.
    Unfortunately the confusion has made it into code, with the R_TLS_IE relocation
    now doing double duty as meaning actual initial exec when externally linking and
    boring old local exec when linking internally (half of this is my fault). So this
    stops using R_TLS_IE in the local exec case. There is a chance this might break
    plan9 or windows, but I don't think so. Next step is working out what the heck is
    going on on ARM...
