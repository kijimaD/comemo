    go/internal/srcimporter: use the 'go' command from the Importer's GOROOT
    
    We have no guarantee in general that there is any 'go' command in
    $PATH at all, let alone the correct one. However, we can expect that
    if a 'go' command is not in scope, the Importer should have a correct
    GOROOT setting: otherwise, it would not be able to import anything
    from 'std' at all.
    
    Given that information, when we run `go tool cgo` we should use
    GOROOT/bin/go specifically, not whatever 'go' we find in $PATH.
    
    This fixes a failure in go/types.TestStdlib that manifests as a
    timeout in when the 'go' command is not present in $PATH, due to
    repeated retries for every package that transitively depends on
    runtime/cgo.
    
    For #51461
