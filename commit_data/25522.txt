    runtime/pprof: skip TestStackBarrierProfiling on FreeBSD, too
    
    Sigh. Sleeps on FreeBSD also yield the rest of the time slice and
    profiling signals are only delivered when a process completes a time
    slice (worse, itimer time is only accounted to the process that
    completes a time slice). It's less noticeable than the other BSDs
    because the default tick rate is 1000Hz, but it's still failing
    regularly.
    
    Fixes #13846.
