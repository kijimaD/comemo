    runtime: throw on zero-sized range passed to addrRanges.add
    
    addrRanges represents a set of addresses. Currently, passing in a
    zero-sized range will cause that range to be added to the list, even
    though it doesn't represent any address (addrRanges.contains will still
    always return false, and findSucc will give surprising results).
    
    We could ignore this input, but it's almost always a bug for the calling
    code to pass in a zero-sized range, so just throw.
