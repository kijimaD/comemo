    go/internal/gccgoimporter: recognize "any" as a builtin type
    
    In CL 536715 we're changing the gofrontend export data to report
    "any" as a builtin type. This permits us to distinguish the builtin
    type from some other package-level type "any". That requires an update
    to this code.
