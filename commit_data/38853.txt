    cmd/compile: fix static initializer
    
    staticcopy of a struct or array should recursively call itself, not
    staticassign.
    
    This fixes an issue where a struct with a slice in it is copied during
    static initialization. In this case, the backing array for the slice
    is duplicated, and each copy of the slice refers to a different
    backing array, which is incorrect.  That issue has existed since at
    least Go 1.2.
    
    I'm not sure why this was never noticed. It seems like a pretty
    obvious bug if anyone modifies the resulting slice.
    
    In any case, we started to notice when the optimization in CL 140301
    landed.  Here is basically what happens in issue29013b.go:
    1) The error above happens, so we get two backing stores for what
       should be the same slice.
    2) The code for initializing those backing stores is reused.
       But not duplicated: they are the same Node structure.
    3) The order pass allocates temporaries for the map operations.
       For the first instance, things work fine and two temporaries are
       allocated and stored in the OKEY nodes. For the second instance,
       the order pass decides new temporaries aren't needed, because
       the OKEY nodes already have temporaries in them.
       But the order pass also puts a VARKILL of the temporaries between
       the two instance initializations.
    4) In this state, the code is technically incorrect. But before
       CL 140301 it happens to work because the temporaries are still
       correctly initialized when they are used for the second time. But then...
    5) The new CL 140301 sees the VARKILLs and decides to reuse the
       temporary for instance 1 map 2 to initialize the instance 2 map 1
       map. Because the keys aren't re-initialized, instance 2 map 1
       gets the wrong key inserted into it.
    
    Fixes #29013
