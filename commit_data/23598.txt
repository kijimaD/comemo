    cmd/internal/obj: shrink Prog, remove two unused fields
    
    Printed and Width were unused.
    
    Despite only removing two bytes, due to alignment, 8 bytes are saved
    on 64-bit:
    
    Before: unsafe.Sizeof(obj.Prog{}) == 304
     After: unsafe.Sizeof(obj.Prog{}) == 296
    
    The next size class below 320 (304=>19(320)) is 288. Still 8 bytes
    away from that.
