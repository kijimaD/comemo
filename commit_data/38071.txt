    cmd/compile/internal/gc: add alternative node dumper for debugging
    
    dump/fdump is a reflection-based data structure dumper slightly
    customized for the compiler's Node data structure. It dumps the
    transitivle closure of Node (and other) data structures using a
    recursive descent depth first traversal and permits filtering
    options (recursion depth limitation, filtering of struct fields).
    
    I have been using it to diagnose compiler bugs and found it more
    useful than the existing node printing code in some cases because
    field filtering reduces the output to the interesting parts.
    
    No impact on rest of compiler if functions are not called (which
    they only should during a debugging session).
