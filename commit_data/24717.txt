    cmd/compile: fix register allocation for == operator
    
    The issue 12226 has been caused by the allocation of the same register
    for the equality check of two byte values. The code in cgen.go freed the
    register for the second operand before the allocation of the register
    for the first operand.
    
    Fixes #12226
