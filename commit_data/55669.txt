commit 969c3ba83934e4d9253140b67c4d4ca35095039d
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 14:54:47 2023 -0800

    go/types, types2: use new type inference algorithm exclusively
    
    The primary change is that type inference now always reports
    an error if a unification step fails (rather than ignoring that
    case, see infer2.go). This brings the implementation closely to
    the description in #58650; but the implementation is more direct
    by always maintaining a simple (type parameter => type) mapping.
    
    To make this work, there are two small but subtle changes in the
    unifier:
    
    1) When deciding whether to proceed with the underlying type of
       a defined type, we also use the underlying type if the other
       type is a basic type (switch from !hasName(x) to isTypeLit(x)
       in unifier.go). This makes the case in issue #53650 work out.
       See the comment in the code for a detailed explanation of this
       change.
    
    2) When we unify against an unbound type parameter, we always
       proceed with its core type (if any).
       Again, see the comment in the code for a detailed explanation
       of this change.
    
    The remaining changes are comment and test adjustments. Because
    the new logic now results in failing type inference where it
    succeeded before or vice versa, and then instatiation or parameter
    passing failed, a handful of error messages changed.
    As desired, we still have the same number of errors for the same
    programs.
    
    Also, because type inference now produces different results, we
    cannot easily compare against infer1 anymore (also infer1 won't
    work correctly anymore due to the changes in the unifier). This
    comparison (together with infer1) is now disabled.
    
    Because some errors and their positions have changed, we need a
    slightly larger error position tolerance for types2 (which produces
    less accurate error positions than go/types). Hence the change in
    types2/check_test.go.
    
    Finally, because type inference is now slightly more relaxed,
    issue #51139 doesn't produce a type unification failure anymore
    for a (previously correctly) inferred type argument.
    
    Fixes #51139.
