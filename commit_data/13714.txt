    cgo/misc/test: burn CPU to improve sleep accuracy
    
    Fixes #4008.
    
    Run a background goroutine that wastes CPU to trick the
    power management into raising the CPU frequency which,
    by side effect, makes sleep more accurate on arm.
    
    === RUN TestParallelSleep
    --- PASS: TestParallelSleep (1.30 seconds)
    _cgo_gotypes.go:772:    sleep(1) slept for 1.000458s
