    go/parser: parse incomplete selection "fmt." as a blank selection "fmt._"
    
    Formerly it would return a BadExpr.
    
    This prevents partial syntax from being discarded, and makes the error
    recovery logic more consistent with other places where an identifier
    was expected but not found.
    
    + test
