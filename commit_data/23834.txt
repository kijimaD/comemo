    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile/ssa: fix string compilation
    
    Compilation of f_ssa was broken by CL 10929.
    
    This CL does not include tests because
    I have a work in progress CL that will catch
    this and much more.
    
    package p
    
    func f_ssa() string {
            return "ABC"
    }
