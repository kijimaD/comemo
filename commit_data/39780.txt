    runtime: disable event scanning error reporting on solaris
    
    It seems like we need to pay special attention to capturing error
    condition on the event port of SmartOS. The previous attempt CL 167777
    works on Oracle Solaris but doesn't work on SmartOS for the uncertain
    reason. It's better to disable the reporting for now.
    
    Updates #30624.
    Fixes #30840.
