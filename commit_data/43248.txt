    [dev.link] cmd/link: record per-phase memory profile
    
    We already have an option to record per-phase CPU profiles. If we're
    in "mem" benchmark mode, then it also makes sense to collect a heap
    profile of the live heap at the end of a phase. This CL adds that
    profile and changes the extensions of the profiles to "cpuprof" and
    "memprof" to make the distinction clear.
