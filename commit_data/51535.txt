    runtime: remove arbitrary timeouts in finalizer tests
    
    These short timeouts can overrun due to system scheduling delay
    (or GC latency) on a slow or heavily-loaded host.
    
    Moreover, if the test deadlocks we will probably want to know what the
    GC goroutines were doing at the time. With an arbitrary timeout, we
    never get that information; however, if we allow the test to time out
    completely we will get a goroutine dump (and, if GOTRACEBACK is
    configured in the environment, that may even include GC goroutines).
    
    Fixes #57166.
