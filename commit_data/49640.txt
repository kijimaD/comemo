    cmd/go: save zip sums for downloaded modules in 'go mod download' in a workspace
    
    Within a single module we expect all needed checksums to have already
    been recorded by a previous call to 'go get' or 'go mod tidy' in that
    module. However, when we combine multiple modules in a workspace, they
    may upgrade each other's dependencies, so a given module might be
    upgraded above the highest version recorded in the individual go.sum
    files for the workspace modules.
    
    Since the checksums might not be present in individual go.sum files,
    record them in go.work.sum.
    
    Fixes #51946.
