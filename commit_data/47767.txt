    cmd/compile/abi-internal: declare X15 scratch in function bodies
    
    X15 must be zero at function calls and returns, but can be used as
    scratch in the middle of a function. This allows things like memmove
    and the hashing functions to use X15 temporarily, as long as they set
    it back to 0 before returning.
    
    This CL also clarifies the distinction between register meanings on
    function call versus function return, since some of them have fixed
    meanings at both call and return, while others only have a fixed
    meaning at calls.
    
    Updates #40724.
