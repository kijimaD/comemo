    spec: clarify that each block has its own version of iota
    
    Issue #15550 is clearly an esoteric case but the spec was silent
    about it and we had diverging implementations. By making `iota`
    and index that is relative to the respective constant declaration,
    nested const declarations won't affect outer values of `iota`.
    
    cmd/compile and go/types already follow this semantics.
    
    Fixes #15550.
