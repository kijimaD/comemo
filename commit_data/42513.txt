    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: skip TestNexting with old Delve on linux/386
    
    Support for linux/386 was added to Delve in version 1.4.1, but the
    version of Delve currently installed on the linux-386-longtest
    builder is 1.2.0. That isn't new enough, which causes the test
    to fail. Skip it on that builder until it can be made to work.
    
    The only reason it used to pass on the linux-386-longtest builder
    before is because that builder was misconfigured to run tests for
    linux/amd64. This was resolved in CL 234520.
    
    Also improve internal documentation and the text of skip reasons.
    
    Fixes #39309.
