    runtime: document relaxed access to arena_used
    
    The unsynchronized accesses to mheap_.arena_used in the concurrent
    part of the garbage collector look like a problem waiting to happen.
    In fact, they are safe, but the reason is somewhat subtle and
    undocumented. This commit documents this reasoning.
    
    Related to issue #9984.
