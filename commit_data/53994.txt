    compress/flate: update NewReader documentation
    
    Calling close is no longer necessary.
    It was was originally necessary to cleanup goroutines
    spawned to decompress the stream.
    This has not been the case since CL 4548079.
    
    Update the documentation to mention how it handles trailing data
    after the end of the DEFLATE stream.
