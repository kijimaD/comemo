    net: document dummy byte in ReadMsgUnix and WriteMsgUnix
    
    ReadMsgUnix and WriteMsgUnix both will read/write 1 byte from/to the
    socket if they were given no buffer to read/write, to avoid a common
    pitfall in out of band operations (they will usually block
    indefinitely if there's no actual data to read).
    
    This patch adds a note about this behaviour in their documentation, so
    users can be aware of it.
