    cmd/compile/internal, runtime: use NOOP for hardware NOPs on loong64
    
    The canonical LoongArch NOP instruction form is "andi r0, r0, 0", as
    described in the LoongArch Reference Manual Volume 1, Section 2.2.1.10.
    We currently use NOR instead, which may or may not change anything (e.g.
    performance on less capable micro-architectures) but is deviation from
    upstream standards nevertheless. Fix them to use the explicit hardware
    NOP which happens to be supported as `NOOP`.
