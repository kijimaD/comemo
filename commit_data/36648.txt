    path/filepath: make Abs("") return working directory on Windows
    
    The current Abs docs say:
    
            // If the path is not absolute it will be joined with the current
            // working directory to turn it into an absolute path.
    
    The empty string is not an absolute path, so the docs suggest that the
    empty string should be joined with the current working directory to
    turn it into an absolute path. This was already the case on all
    platforms other than Windows. Per the decision in issue #24441,
    this change makes it work on Windows too.
    
    Since the empty string is not a valid path for the purposes of calling
    os.Stat on it, we can't simply add the empty string test case to
    absTests, which TestAbs uses. It would error when trying to do:
    
            info, err := os.Stat(path)
    
    I didn't find a good way to modify TestAbs to handle this situation
    without significantly complicating its code and compromising the test.
    So, a separate test is created for testing Abs on empty string input.
    
    Fixes #24441.
