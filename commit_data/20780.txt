commit c5943c668b919b98fd107c2327678ee32a868246

    net/http/pprof: run GC for /debug/pprof/heap?gc=1
    
    We force runtime.GC before WriteHeapProfile with -test.heapprofile.
    Make it possible to do the same with the HTTP interface.
    
    Some servers only run a GC every few minutes.
    On such servers, the heap profile will be a few minutes stale,
    which may be too old to be useful.
    
    Requested by private mail.
