    build: require old Go to build new Go (and convert cmd/dist to Go)
    
    This CL introduces the bootstrap requirement that in order to
    build the current release (or development version) of Go, you
    need an older Go release (1.4 or newer) already installed.
    This requirement is the whole point of this CL.
    
    To enforce the requirement, convert cmd/dist from C to Go.
    
    With this bootstrapping out of the way, we can move on to
    replacing other, larger C programs like the Go compiler,
    the assemblers, and the linker.
    
    See golang.org/s/go15bootstrap for details.
