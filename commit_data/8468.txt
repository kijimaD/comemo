    go spec: clarify rules for shifts
    
    Note: This is not a spec change.
    
    The spec was not clear on the result type of
    constant shift expressions. Made it more
    explicit and added additional examples.
    
    Also: Remove paragraph on send expressions (they
    are statements, now).
    
    Fixes #1708.
