commit 9c1f14f3763dbbc0d8105fa88c0b7bdad5674ee7

    doc/install-source: create distinction between steps that involve "git clone"
    
    Prior doc implied that "git clone" was one way to obtain a go1.4
    bootstrap toochain, but it did not state this outright. Further,
    the doc did not make it explicit in the "Fetch the repository"
    section that one must necessarily "git clone" a second time in
    the (presumed-to-be-uncommon) case where "git clone" had already
    been perfomed in the "compiler binaries" section.
    
    Updates #33402
