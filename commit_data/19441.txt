    spec: explicitly disallow blank methods in interface types
    
    The spec was unclear about whether blank methods should be
    permitted in interface types. gccgo permits at most one, gc
    crashes if there are more than one, go/types permits at most
    one.
    
    Discussion:
    
    Since method sets of non-interface types never contain methods
    with blank names (blank methods are never declared), it is impossible
    to satisfy an interface with a blank method.
    
    It is possible to declare variables of assignable interface types
    (but not necessarily identical types) containing blank methods, and
    assign those variables to each other, but the values of those
    variables can only be nil.
    
    There appear to be two "reasonable" alternatives:
    
    1) Permit at most one blank method (since method names must be unique),
    and consider it part of the interface. This is what appears to happen
    now, with corner-case bugs. Such interfaces can never be implemented.
    
    2) Permit arbitrary many blank methods but ignore them. This appears
    to be closer to the handling of blank identifiers in declarations.
    However, an interface type literal is not a declaration (it's a type
    literal). Also, for struct types, blank identifiers are not ignored;
    so the analogy with declarations is flawed.
    
    Both these alternatives don't seem to add any benefit and are likely
    (if only slightly) more complicated to explain and implement than
    disallowing blank methods in interfaces altogether.
    
    Fixes #6604.
