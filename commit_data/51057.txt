    runtime: skip TestArenaCollision on failed reservation
    
    If TestArenaCollision cannot reserve the address range it expects to
    reserve, it currently fails somewhat mysteriously. Detect this case
    and skip the test. This could lead to test rot if we wind up always
    skipping this test, but it's not clear that there's a better answer.
    If the test does fail, we now also log what it thinks it reserved so
    the failure message is more useful in debugging any issues.
    
    Fixes #49415
    Fixes #54597
