    test/bench/go1: first draft of Go 1 benchmark suite
    
    I have included a few important microbenchmarks,
    but the overall intent is to have mostly end-to-end
    benchmarks timing real world operations.
    
    The jsondata.go file is a summary of agl's
    activity in various open source repositories.
    It gets used as test data for many of the benchmarks.
    
    Everything links into one binary (even the test data)
    so that it is easy to run the benchmarks on many
    computers: there is just one file to copy around.
