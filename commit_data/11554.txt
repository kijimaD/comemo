    os/exec: make sure file is not closed early in leaked fd test
    
    Without this change, fd3 can be collected by the garbage
    collector and finalized, which causes the file descriptor to
    be closed, which causes the call to os.Open to return 3 rather
    than the expected descriptor number.
