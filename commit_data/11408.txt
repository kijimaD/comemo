    cmd/goapi: new tool for tracking exported API over time
    
    The idea is that we add files to the api/ directory which
    are sets of promises for the future.  Each line in a file
    is a stand-alone feature description.
    
    When we do a release, we make sure we haven't broken or changed
    any lines from the past (only added them).
    
    We never change old files, only adding new ones. (go-1.1.txt,
    etc)
