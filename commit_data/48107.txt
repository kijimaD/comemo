    runtime: skip TestGdbBacktrace flakes matching a known GDB internal error
    
    TestGdbBacktrace occasionally fails due to a GDB internal error.
    We have observed the error on various linux builders since at least
    October 2020, and it has been reported upstream at least twice.¹²
    
    Since the bug is external to the Go project and does not appear to be
    fixed upstream, this failure mode can only add noise.
