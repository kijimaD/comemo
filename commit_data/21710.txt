    runtime: use func value for parfor body
    
    Yet another leftover from C: parfor took a func value for the
    callback, casted it to an unsafe.Pointer for storage, and then casted
    it back to a func value to call it.  This is unnecessary, so just
    store the body as a func value.  Beyond general cleanup, this also
    eliminates the last use of unsafe in parfor.
