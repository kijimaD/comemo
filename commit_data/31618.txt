    runtime: use pselect6 for usleep on linux/amd64 and linux/arm
    
    Android O black-lists the select system call because its libc, Bionic,
    does not use this system call. Replace our use of select with pselect6
    (which is allowed) on the platforms that support targeting Android.
    linux/arm64 already uses pselect6 because there is no select on arm64,
    so only linux/amd64 and linux/arm need changing. pselect6 has been
    available since Linux 2.6.16, which is before Go's minimum
    requirement.
    
    Fixes #20409.
