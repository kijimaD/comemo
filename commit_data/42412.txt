    runtime: do not use PowerRegisterSuspendResumeNotification on systems with "program time" timer
    
    Systems where PowerRegisterSuspendResumeNotification returns ERROR_
    FILE_NOT_FOUND are also systems where nanotime() is on "program time"
    rather than "real time".  The chain for this is:
    
    powrprof.dll!PowerRegisterSuspendResumeNotification ->
      umpdc.dll!PdcPortOpen ->
        ntdll.dll!ZwAlpcConnectPort("\\PdcPort") ->
          syscall -> ntoskrnl.exe!AlpcpConnectPort
    
    Opening \\.\PdcPort fails with STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND when pdc.sys
    hasn't been initialized. Pdc.sys also provides the various hooks for
    sleep resumption events, which means if it's not loaded, then our "real
    time" timer is actually on "program time". Finally STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_
    NOT_FOUND is passed through RtlNtStatusToDosError, which returns ERROR_
    FILE_NOT_FOUND. Therefore, in the case where the function returns ERROR_
    FILE_NOT_FOUND, we don't mind, since the timer we're using will
    correspond fine with the lack of sleep resumption notifications. This
    applies, for example, to Docker users.
