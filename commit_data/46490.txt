    cmd/compile: fix missing markHiddenClosureDead in deadcode pass
    
    CL 342350 fixed panic with dead hidden closures, by marking discarded
    hidden closure as dead, and won't compile them. However, the fix is
    incomplete. In case the "if" or "else" block end with panic or return
    statement:
    
            if true { return }
            # All nodes starts from here are dead
    
    the dead nodes must be processed with markHiddenClosureDead, but they
    are not, causing the compiler crashes.
    
    This CL adds that missing part.
    
    Fixes #48459
