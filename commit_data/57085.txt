    cmd/distpack: make go_$GOOS_$GOARCH_exec programs executable
    
    The go command recognizes when a program named go_$GOOS_$GOARCH_exec
    is in PATH. There are two such programs living in GOROOT/misc/wasm.
    Like GOROOT/bin/{go,gofmt} and GOROOT/pkg/tool/**, these programs
    need to have the executable bit set to do their job, so set it.
    
    Comparing a distpack produced before and after this change shows that
    the pack.go file is modified, the two go_{js,wasip1}_wasm_exec programs
    have the new file mode, and there are no other changes, as expected.
    
    The mode change is relevant to the binary and source distributions only.
    No change to the module zip since it doesn't include GOROOT/misc at all,
    so no effect on previously created toolchain modules whose checksums
    are already recorded in the Go checksum database and cannot be changed.
    (Other than by changing their "v0.0.1" version, but that's expensive.)
    
    Fixes #60843.
