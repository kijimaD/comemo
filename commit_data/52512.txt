    cmd/link: resolve relocations to .TOC. symbol
    
    CL 404296 breaks the PPC64LE build because the .TOC. symbol is
    visibility hidden and was skipped from the "unresolved symbol"
    check (the check needs to be fix). In face, the .TOC. symbol is
    special in that it doesn't have a type but we have special logic
    to assign a value to it in the address pass. So we can actually
    resolve a relocation to .TOC.. We already have a special case
    for PIE. It also applies to non-PIE as well.
    
    Fix PPC64LE builds.
