    cmd/compile: use constants directly for fast map access calls
    
    CL 35554 taught order.go to use static variables
    for constants that needed to be addressable for runtime routines.
    However, there is one class of runtime routines that
    do not actually need an addressable value: fast map access routines.
    This CL teaches order.go to avoid using static variables
    for addressability in those cases.
    Instead, it avoids introducing a temp at all,
    which the backend would just have to optimize away.
    
    Fixes #19015.
