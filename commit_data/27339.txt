    compress: update documentation regarding footer verification
    
    Address two documentation issues:
    1) Document that the GZIP and ZLIB footer is only verified when the
    reader has been fully consumed.
    2) The zlib reader is guaranteed to not read past the EOF if the
    input io.Reader is also a io.ByteReader. This functionality was
    documented in the flate and gzip packages but not on zlib.
    
    Fixes #14867
