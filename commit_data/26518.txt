    reflect: name interface type that pins method info
    
    I recently added TestUnexportedMethods which uses an interface type
    to pin type information for an unexported method. But as written,
    the interface type is not accessible to the reflect package.
    
    You can imagine a future compiler optimization realizing that and
    removing the type information for f. In fact, cl/20901 happens to
    do that.
