    cmd/compile: disable rewrite loop detector for deadcode-only changes
    
    We're guaranteed we won't infinite loop on deadcode-only changes,
    because each change converts valid -> invalid, and there are only a
    finite number of valid values.
    
    The loops this test is looking for are those generated by rule
    applications, so it isn't useful to check for loops when rules aren't
    involved.
    
    Fixes #51639
