    cmd/go: fix test for issue 8181
    
    The test was translated from shell incorrectly,
    and it depended on having hg installed, which
    may not be the case.
    
    Moved repo to GitHub, updated code, and fixed
    go list ... command to be expected to succeed.
    
    Fixes test for #8181.
