    runtime: replace cgoCtxt slice with index in traceback
    
    Currently, gentraceback consumes the gp.cgoCtxt slice by copying the
    slice header and then sub-slicing it as it unwinds. The code for this
    is nice and clear, but we're about to lift this state into a structure
    and mutating it is going to introduce write barriers that are
    disallowed in gentraceback.
    
    This CL replaces the mutable slice header with an index into
    gp.cgoCtxt.
    
    For #54466.
