    net/http/httptrace: expose request headers for http/1.1
    
    Some headers, which are set or modified by the http library,
    are not written to the standard http.Request.Header and are
    not included as part of http.Response.Request.Header.
    
    Exposing all headers alleviates this problem.
    
    This is not a complete solution to 19761 since it does not have http/2 support.
    
    Updates #19761
