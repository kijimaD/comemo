    cmd/compile: fix fieldtrack experiment
    
    The ODOTPTRs introduced in CL #19814 don't have field names,
    just offsets.  The fieldtrack experiment crashes when
    examining them.  Instead, just ignore them.  We'll never track
    these fields anyway.
    
    It would be nice to have the runtime type struct build in the
    compiler (like we do sudog, for example) so we could use its
    fieldnames.  Doesn't seem worth it just for this CL.
