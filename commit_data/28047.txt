    runtime: remove unused type sigtabtt
    
    The type sigtabtt was introduced by an automated tool in
    https://golang.org/cl/167550043. It was the Go version of the C type
    SigTab. However, when the C code using SigTab was converted to Go in
    https://golang.org/cl/168500044 it was rewritten to use a different Go
    type, sigTabT, rather than sigtabtt (the difference being that sigTabT
    uses string where sigtabtt uses *int8 from the C type char*). So this is
    just a dreg from the conversion that was never actually used.
