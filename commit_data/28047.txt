    cmd/compile: don't use line numbers from ONAME and named OLITERALs
    
    The line numbers of ONAMEs are the location of their
    declaration, not their use.
    
    The line numbers of named OLITERALs are also the location
    of their declaration.
    
    Ignore both of these.  Instead, we will inherit the line number from
    the containing syntactic item.
    
    Fixes #14742
    Fixes #15430
