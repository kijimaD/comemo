    cmd/dist: skip rebuilding packages during builder testing
    
    Since packages in "std" no longer have install targets, checking them
    for staleness is somewhat meaningless: if they are not cached they
    will be rebuilt anyway, and without installed archives against which
    we can compare them the staleness check will not detect builder skew.
    
    It would still be meaningful to check "cmd" for staleness, but
    (especially on sharded VM-based builders) that is a fairly expensive
    operation relative to its benefit. If we are really interested in
    detecting builder skew and/or build reproducibility, we could instead
    add a "misc" test (similar to "misc/reboot", or perhaps even a part of
    that test) that verifies that bootstrapped binaries are reproducible.
    
    For #57734.
    Updates #47257.
    Updates #56896.
