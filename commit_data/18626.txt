    cmd/go: Plan 9 compatible "env" output
    
    Fixes the output of go env so that variables can be set
    more accurately when using Plan 9's rc shell. Specifically,
    GOPATH may have multiple components and the current
    representation is plain wrong. In practice, we probably
    ought to change os. Getenv to produce the right result, but
    that requires considerably more thought.
