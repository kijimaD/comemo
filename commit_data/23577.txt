    cmd/internal/obj: make arm64 use RegTo2 instead of a full fledged Addr To2
    
    It shrinks Prog type from 448 bytes down to 376 bytes on amd64.
    
    It also makes sense, because I don't know of any modern architecture
    that have instructions which can write to two destinations, none of
    which is a register (even x86 doesn't have such instructions).
