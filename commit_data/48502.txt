    Revert "[dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: include coverage in logged stats"
    
    This reverts commit 54f067812dd870c305daabd22ca190b0f48e672e.
    
    Reason for revert: While this is helpful for the engineering team when we're debugging, it might lead to users feeling like the fuzzer is stuck and that there are a lot of edges that are still yet to be reached. In reality, it's very likely that the compiler will instrument more lines of code than are actually reachable by the fuzz target, so showing the ratio between number of edges hit vs. all edges can be misleading. In the future, we may want to consider making this information viewable by a debug flag or something similar.
