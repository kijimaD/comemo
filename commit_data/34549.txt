    encoding/json: Include the offset of a SyntaxError
    
    When a SyntaxError occurs, report the current offset within the stream.
    The code already accounted for the offset within the current buffer
    being scanned. By including how much data was already scanned, the
    current offset can be computed.
    
    Fixes #22478
