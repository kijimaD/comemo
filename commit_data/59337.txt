    cmd/go/internal/modload: make it clear -mod can't be set in some cases
    
    We check that -mod can't be set to mod in workspace mode, but then we
    set BuildMod to mod for go work sync below. Make it clear that that's
    okay because we can't pass -mod=mod to go work sync (or the other go
    mod commands that can run in workspace mode that set mod=mod: go mod
    graph, go mod verify, and go mod why).
