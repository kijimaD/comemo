    cmd/compile: enable CSE of constant strings
    
    CL 27254 changed a constant string to a byte array
    in encoding/hex and got significant performance
    improvements.
    
    hex.Encode used the string twice in a single function.
    The rewrite rules lower constant strings into components.
    The pointer component requires an aux symbol.
    The existing implementation created a new aux symbol every time.
    As a result, constant string pointers were never CSE'd.
    Tighten then moved the pointer calculation next to the uses, i.e.
    into the loop.
    
    The re-use of aux syms enabled by this CL
    occurs 3691 times during make.bash.
    
    This CL should not go in without CL 38338
    or something like it.
