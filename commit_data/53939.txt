    cmd/cgo/internal/testplugin: simplify TestForkExec and log stderr output
    
    This test used to run with a separate goroutine for timeout behavior,
    presumably because it was difficult to set an appropriate timeout.
    
    Now that the test is in cmd instead of misc, we can use
    internal/testenv.Command, which makes adding the test timeout much
    simpler and eliminates the need for the explicit goroutine.
    
    For #61846.
