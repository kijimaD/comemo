commit 6f321e28f48c12e7dd9830198daefc2a8cfb410b
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 12 11:04:11 2009 -0700

    - remove special handling of '\n' characters (used to be treated as comments
    for pretty printer purposes - now properly ignored as white space since we
    have line/col information)
    - changed sample use in comment to an actually compiled function to make sure
    sample is actually working
    - added extra tests (checking line and column values, and the tokenize function)
