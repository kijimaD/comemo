    log/slog: empty calls to With and WithGroup are no-ops
    
    It doesn't make sense to call Logger.WithGroup with the empty string.
    Make it a no-op by returning the receiver.
    This relieves handlers of the burden of detecting that case themselves.
    
    Less importantly, but for consistency, if Logger.With is called with
    no args, make it a no-op by returning the receiver.
    
    Along the way, fix obsolete mentions of "the Logger's context" in the
    doc.
