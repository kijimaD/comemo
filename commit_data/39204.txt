    doc: mention 'go get golang.org/dl/...' in install
    
    I needed Go 1.10 to debug and fix a test failure on that Go version in
    x/tools, but I forgot what the magic 'go get' command for this was.
    
    Googling "download specific golang version" and similar keywords showed
    no results, presumably because the golang.org/dl subrepo isn't
    prominently recommended nor documented anywhere.
    
    The most appropriate documentation page to add this to is doc/install,
    since it goes into some detail and is well indexed. We only need a short
    section to introduce the trick.
    
    The example does mention a specific version, Go 1.10.7, but I couldn't
    imagine a way to make it version-agnostic while still being clear on
    what the commands effectively do.
