    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: fix registers for in-place instructions
    
    Some of these were right; others weren't.
    
    Fixes 'GOGC=off GOSSAPKG=mime go test -a mime'.
    
    The right long term fix is probably to teach the
    register allocator about in-place instructions.
    In the meantime, all the tests that we can run
    now pass.
