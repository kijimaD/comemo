    cmd/compile: in poset, move all constants to the first DAG
    
    In poset, all constants are always related to each other, so they
    are part of the same DAG. Currently, it can be any of the DAGs in
    the forest. Since we're about to start visiting that DAG for the
    task of calculating bounds, make sure that it's conventionally
    always the first, so that we don't need to search for it.
