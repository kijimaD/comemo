    go/types: remove a test case and update comment
    
    The original need for the extra test case and issue was eliminated
    by https://golang.org/cl/116815 which introduced systematic cycle
    detection. Now that we correctly report the cycle, we can't say much
    about the invalid cast anyway (the type is invalid due to the cycle).
    
    A more sophisticated approach would be able to tell the size of
    a function type independent of the details of that type, but the
    type-checker is not set up for this kind of lazy type-checking.
    
    Fixes #23127.
