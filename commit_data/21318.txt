    encoding/base64: add unpadded encodings, and test all encodings.
    
    Some applications use unpadded base64 format, omitting the trailing
    '=' padding characters from the standard base64 format, either to
    minimize size or (more justifiably) to avoid use of the '=' character.
    Unpadded flavors are standard and documented in section 3.2 of RFC 4648.
    
    To support these unpadded flavors, this change adds two predefined
    encoding variables, RawStdEncoding and RawURLEncoding, for unpadded
    encodings using the standard and URL character set, respectively.
    The change also adds a function WithPadding() to customize the padding
    character or disable padding in a custom Encoding.
    
    Finally, I noticed that the existing base64 test-suite was only
    exercising the StdEncoding, and not referencing URLEncoding at all.
    This change adds test-suite functionality to exercise all four encodings
    (the two existing ones and the two new unpadded flavors),
    although it still doesn't run *every* test on all four encodings.
    
    Naming: I used the "Raw" prefix because it's more concise than "Unpadded"
    and seemed just as expressive, but I have no strong preferences here.
    Another short alternative prefix would be "Min" ("minimal" encoding).
