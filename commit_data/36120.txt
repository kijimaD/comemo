    cmd/compile: drop legacy code for generating iface wrappers
    
    Originally, scalar values were directly stored within interface values
    as long as they fit into a pointer-sized slot of memory. And since
    interface method calls always pass the full pointer-sized value as the
    receiver argument, value-narrowing wrappers were necessary to adapt to
    the calling convention for methods with smaller receiver types.
    
    However, for precise garbage collection, we now only store actual
    pointers within interface values, so these wrappers are no longer
    necessary.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
