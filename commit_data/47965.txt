    runtime: deflake TestPreemptionAfterSyscall
    
    This test occasionally takes very slightly longer than the 3 second
    timeout on slow builders (especially windows-386-2008), so increase
    the timeout to 5 seconds. It fails with much longer timeouts on Plan
    9, so skip it as flaky there.
    
    Updates #41015.
