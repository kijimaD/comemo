    runtime: skip TestSignalIgnoreSIGTRAP on all OpenBSD builders
    
    TestSignalIgnoreSIGTRAP is flaky on OpenBSD and the cause is suspected
    to be a kernel bug. This test is currently only skipped on the previous
    OpenBSD 6.2 and 6.4 builders for #17496. In the meantime the OpenBSD
    builders were upgraded to more recent OpenBSD versions (currently 6.8
    and 7.0). It seems the issue is still present in these OpenBSD versions
    and there is no obvious workaround in Go. Thus, skip the flaky test on
    OpenBSD in general.
