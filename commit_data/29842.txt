    cmd/compile, runtime: a different approach to duplicate itabs
    
    golang.org/issue/17594 was caused by additab being called more than once for
    an itab. golang.org/cl/32131 fixed that by making the itabs local symbols,
    but that in turn causes golang.org/issue/18252 because now there are now
    multiple itab symbols in a process for a given (type,interface) pair and
    different code paths can end up referring to different itabs which breaks
    lots of reflection stuff. So this makes itabs global again and just takes
    care to only call additab once for each itab.
    
    Fixes #18252
