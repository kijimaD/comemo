commit b859a78e0a71d769274dac8cf0108bdf41ec55a5

    io: use SeekStart, SeekCurrent, and SeekEnd in io.Seeker documentation
    
    The documentation previously used C style enumerations: 0, 1, 2.
    While this is pretty much universally correct, it does not help a user
    become aware of the existence of the SeekStart, SeekCurrent, and SeekEnd
    constants. Thus, we should use them in the documentation to direct people's
    attention to them.
    
    Updates #6885
