    godoc: peephole optimization for generated HTML
    
    When searching for regular expressions such as
    ".", there are many consecutive matches.
    In the generated HTML, combine them instead of
    generating a new <span> for each adjacent text
    segment highlighting a match.
    
    Massively reduces the size of the generated
    HTML in those cases.
