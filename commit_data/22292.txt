    cmd/internal/obj/x86: change SHRQ to store second source in From3, not jammed into From
    
    SHRQ CX, DX:AX is changing to SHRQ CX, AX, DX.
    This is the first step: using SHRQ From=CX, From3=AX, To=DX
    as the preferred encoding.
    Once the assemblers and 6g have been updated,
    support for the old encoding can be removed.
