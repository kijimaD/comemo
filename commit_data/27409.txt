    cmd/compile: avoid pointers in go.string.* symbols
    
    When creating binaries for dynamic linking, the linker moves
    read-only data symbols that contain pointers into relro sections.
    It is not setup for handling a go.string symbol moving to relro.
    
    Instead of teaching it how (because go.string symbols with pointers
    are unusual anyhow), put the data in a type.. section.
    
    Fixes the android builder.
