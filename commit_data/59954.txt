    cmd/internal/obj/loong64: improve the definition of plan9 assembly format in optab
    
    In the three formats corresponding to case 7 of the function asmout, BREAK actually
    corresponds to the cacop instruction of Loong64, refer to the loong64 instruction
    manual volume 1 [1], the cacop instruction is a privileged instruction used to
    maintain the cache, and the user mode does not have permission to execute.
    
    Referring to the loong64 instruction manual volume 1 [1], the SYSCALL, BREAK and DBAR
    instructions have similar formats and can be grouped into one category, the RDTIMED,
    RDTIMELW and RDTIMEHW instructions can be grouped into one category, and the NOOP and
    UNDEF instructions can be grouped into one category.
