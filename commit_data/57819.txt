    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: update RISC-V instruction table
    
    Regenerate RISC-V instruction table from the riscv-opcodes repository,
    due to various changes and shuffling upstream.
    
    This has been changed to remove pseudo-instructions, since Go only
    needs the instruction encodings and including the pseudo-instructions
    is creating unnecessary complications (for example, the inclusion
    of ANOP and ARET, as well as strangely named aliases such as
    AJALPSEUDO/AJALRPSEUDO). Remove pseudo-instructions that are not
    currently supported by the assembler and add specific handling for
    RDCYCLE, RDTIME and RDINSTRET, which were previously implemented
    via the instruction encodings.
