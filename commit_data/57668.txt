    cmd/compile: add all runtime package dependencies to NoInstrumentPkgs
    
    Currently, this list includes *almost* all runtime packages, but not
    quite all.
    
    We leave out internal/bytealg for reasons explained in the code.
    
    Compiling with or without race instrumentation has no effect on the
    other packages added to the list here, so this is a no-op change
    today, but makes this more robust.
