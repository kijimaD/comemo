    cmd/compile: add mul by ±2ⁿ code-generation tests for arm/arm64
    
    This change adds code generation tests for multiplication by ±2ⁿ for
    arm and arm64, in preparation for a future CL which will remove the
    relevant architecture-specific SSA rules (the reduction is already
    performed by rules in generic.rules added in CL 36323).
