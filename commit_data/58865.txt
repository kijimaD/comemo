    net: clarify maxListenerBacklog windows implementation
    
    The previous TODO comments were somewhat ambiguous. This aims to
    provide a clearer understanding of the behavior on Windows.
    
    Windows does not offer a way to peek at the current backlog length, this
    is explicitly stated in the winapi for `listen`.
    
    When set to `syscall.SOMAXCONN`, the OS dynamically adjusts the
    backlog to a maximum reasonable value. It goes as far as the dotnet
    runtime itself introducing a new version of `listen` that does not accept a
    backlog parameter to help eliminate the confusion when comparing the
    behavior with UNIXes.
    
    The docs also mention that `SOMAXCONN_HINT(N)` can be used, and that
    it clips the final computed value between (200, 65535), which suggests
    windows might use a `uint16` to back this number. Either way it does not
    matter since windows will adjust this value anyway, so I removed the
    wrapping TODO as well.
