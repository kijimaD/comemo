    cmd/cgo: rewrite pointer passing rules in terms of pinning
    
    With the introduction of runtime.Pinner, we need to update the cgo
    pointer passing rules to accomodate the new functionality. These rule
    changes are easier to describe if the rest of the pointer passing rules
    are described in terms of pinning as well (Go memory is implicitly
    pinned when a pointer to it is passed to a C function, and implicitly
    unpinned when that function returns).
    
    For #46787.
