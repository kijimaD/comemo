    cmd/internal/obj, runtime: update funcdata comments
    
    The comments in cmd/internal/obj/funcdata.go are identical to the
    comments in runtime/funcdata.h, but the majority of the definitions
    they refer to don't apply to Go sources and have been stripped out of
    funcdata.go.
    
    Remove these stale comments from funcdata.go and clean up the
    references to other copies of the PCDATA and FUNCDATA indexes.
