    cmd/link: use R12 as trampoline scratch register on ARM
    
    The external linker uses R12. Do the same. We previously use R11,
    the temp register in Go ABI. This does not really matter if the
    caller is Go code, because all registers are clobbered at call.
    But it the caller is C code, it may assume R11 live across a call.
    Using R11 may clobber live value. On the callee side, R12 is not
    an argument register in both Go and C calling convention.
