    cmd/link: put runtime.end in the last section of data segment
    
    Currently the runtime.end symbol is put into the noptrbss section,
    which is usually the last section, except that when fuzzing is
    enabled, the last section is actually .go.fuzzcntrs. The
    runtime.end symbol has the value pointing to the end of the data
    segment, so if it is not in the last section, the value will not
    actually be in the range of the section. This causes an assertion
    failure in the new Apple linker. This CL fixes this by putting it
    in the last section.
    
    Fixes #65169.
