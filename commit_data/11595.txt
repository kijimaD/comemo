    godoc: fix identifier search
    
    Thanks to Andrey Mirtchovski for tracking this down.
    
    This was broken by CL 5528077 which removed the InsertSemis
    flag from go/scanner - as a result, semicolons are now always
    inserted and the respective indexer code checked for the
    wrong token.
    
    Replaced the code by a direct identifier test.
