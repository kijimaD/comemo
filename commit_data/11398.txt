    gofix: handle xml.Unmarshal in xmlapi fix
    
    This improves the handling of xml.Unmarshal in
    the xmlapi fix by guessing some of the common
    types used on it.
    
    This also fixes a bug in the partial typechecker.
    In an expression such as f(&a), it'd mark a as
    having &T rather than *T.
