    runtime: call cgocallbackg indirectly on PPC64
    
    This is CL 312669, for PPC64.
    
    cgocallback calls cgocallbackg after switching the stack. Call it
    indirectly to bypass the linker's nosplit check. The nosplit check
    fails after CL 351271, which removes ABI aliases. It would have
    been failing before but the linker's nosplit check didn't resolve
    ABI alias (it should) so it didn't catch that. Removing the ABI
    aliases exposes it. For this partuclar case it is benign as there
    is actually a stack switch in between.
    
    Should fix PPC64 build.
