    crypto/x509: don't reject certs with critical policy extensions.
    
    There was a missing continue that caused certificates with critical
    certificate-policy extensions to be rejected. Additionally, that code
    structure in general was prone to exactly that bug so I changed it
    around to hopefully be more robust in the future.
    
    Fixes #9964.
