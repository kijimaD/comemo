    internal/syscall/windows: regenerate zsyscall_windows.go
    
    CL 463219 broke TestAllDependencies because zsyscall_windows.go
    was not correctly formatted, probably edited by hand.
    
    The failure was not catch by the CL builders because it is
    only failing on linux longtests builders, which was not executed.
    Windows builders skip that test because it lacks of the `diff` command.
