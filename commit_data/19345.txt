    reflect: fix map type generation
    If a map variable is created with reflect.New it has incorrect type (map[unsafe.Pointer]unsafe.Pointer).
    If GC follows such pointer, it scans Hmap and buckets with incorrect type.
    This can lead to overscan of up to 120 bytes for map[int8]struct{}.
    Which in turn can lead to crash if the memory after a bucket object is unaddressable
    or false retention (buckets are scanned as arrays of unsafe.Pointer).
    I don't see how it can lead to heap corruptions, though.
