    runtime: fix RuntimeGogoBytes on windows/amd64
    
    Before 3c0fee1, runtime.gogo was just long enough to align to 64 bytes
    on OSs with short get_tls implementations and 80 bytes on OSs with
    longer get_tls implementations (Windows, Solaris, and Plan 9).
    3c0fee1 added a few instructions, which pushed it to 80 on most OSs,
    including Windows and Plan 9, and 96 on Solaris.
    
    Fixes #9770.
