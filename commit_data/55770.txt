    cmd/dist: reproducibility fixes
    
    Fix a few lingering reproducibility problems.
    
    - Do not set CC during go install std if it is unset,
      so that the automatic disabling of cgo in cmd/go can run.
    
    - Since CC is not necessary, remove code insisting on it.
    
    - Use a fixed quoting algorithm instead of %q from the
      bootstrap toolchain, which can differ from release to release.
    
    - Remove go_bootstrap tool successfully on Windows.
    
    For #24904.
