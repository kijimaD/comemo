    net/http: log Readdir error to Server.ErrorLog
    
    Now that issue #12438 is resolved, this TODO can be completed.
    Create a logf helper, which is similar to Server.logf method,
    but takes a *Request to infer the *Server and its ErrorLog from.
    
    Update documentation of Server.ErrorLog to mention a new type
    of errors that may be logged to it.
    
    Also update a statement in documentation of Server.ErrorLog from:
    
            // If nil, logging goes to os.Stderr via the log package's
            // standard logger.
    
    To:
    
            // If nil, logging is done via the log package's standard logger.
    
    The motivation for doing so is to avoid making inaccurate claims.
    Logging may not go to os.Stderr if anyone overrides the log package's
    default output via https://godoc.org/log#SetOutput. Saying that
    the standard logger is used should be sufficient to explain the
    behavior, and users can infer that os.Stderr is used by default,
    unless it's changed.
    
    Updates #12438.
