    path/filepath: steer people away from HasPrefix
    
    The strikes against it are:
    
    1. It does not take path boundaries into account.
    2. It assumes that Windows==case-insensitive file system
    and non-Windows==case-sensitive file system, neither of
    which is always true.
    3. Comparing ToLower against ToLower is not a correct
    implementation of a case-insensitive string comparison.
    4. If it returns true on Windows you still don't know how long
    the matching prefix is in bytes, so you can't compute what
    the suffix is.
