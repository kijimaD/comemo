    runtime, cmd/internal/ld: change runtime to use a single linker symbol
    
    In preparation for being able to run a go program that has code
    in several objects, this changes from having several linker
    symbols used by the runtime into having one linker symbol that
    points at a structure containing the needed data.  Multiple
    object support will construct a linked list of such structures.
    
    A follow up will initialize the slices in the themoduledata
    structure directly from the linker but I was aiming for a minimal
    diff for now.
