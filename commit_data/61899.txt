    cmd/internal/obj: disallow linknamed access to builtin symbols
    
    Currently, a symbol reference is counted as a reference to a
    builtin symbol if the name matches a builtin. Usually builtin
    references are generated by the compiler. But one could manually
    write one with linkname. Since the list of builtin functions are
    subject to change from time to time, we don't want users to depend
    on their names. So we don't count a linknamed reference as a
    builtin reference, and instead, count it as a named reference, so
    it is checked by the linker.
