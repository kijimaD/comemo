    cmd/compile: don't attach lines to SB, SP, similar constants
    
    Attaching positions to SB, SP, initial mem can result in
    less-good line-numbering when compiled for debugging.
    This "fix" also removes source position from a zero-valued
    struct (but not from its fields) and from a zero-length
    array constant.
    
    This may be a general problem for constants in entry blocks.
    
    Fixes #20367.
