    cmd/compile: report block start for gotos jumping into blocks
    
    Follow-up on https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/39998/
    which dropped this information.
    
    The reported blocks are the innermost blocks containing a
    label jumped to from outside, not the outermost block as
    reported originally by cmd/compile.
    
    We could report the outermost block with a slighly more
    involved algorithm (need to track containing blocks for
    all unresolved forward gotos), but since gccgo also reports
    the innermost blocks, the current approach seems good enough.
