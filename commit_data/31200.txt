    sort: optimize average calculation in binary search
    
    Use fewer instructions to calculate the average of i and j without
    overflowing at the addition.
    
    Even if both i and j are math.MaxInt{32,64}, the sum fits into a
    uint{32,64}. Because the sum of i and j is always ≥ 0, the right
    shift by one does the same as a division by two. The result of the
    shift operation is at most math.MaxInt{32,64} and fits again into
    an int{32,64}.
