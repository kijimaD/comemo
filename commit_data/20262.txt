    runtime: increase windows prof thread priority sooner
    
    If system is busy burning cpu, it takes long time (about 300ms on
    windows builders) to adjust prof thread priority. Once adjusted, prof
    thread runs ahead of everyone else, but due to initial slowness, it
    does not capture prof snapshots until start-up period is completed.
    
    Change prof thread priority sooner, so it can start captures straight
    away.
