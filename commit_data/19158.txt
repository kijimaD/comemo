    cmd/ld: record complete runtime-gdb.py path again
    
    This code never got updated after the liblink shuffle.
    Tested by hand that it works and respects GOROOT_FINAL.
    
    The discussion in issue 6963 suggests that perhaps we should
    just drop runtime-gdb.py entirely, but I am not convinced
    that is true. It was in Go 1.2 and I don't see a reason not to
    keep it in Go 1.3. The fact that binaries have not been emitting
    the reference was just a missed detail in the liblink conversion,
    not part of a grand plan.
    
    Fixes #7506.
    Fixes #6963.
