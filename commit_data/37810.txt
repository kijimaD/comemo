    cmd/compile: only clobber dead slots at call sites
    
    We now have safepoints at nearly all the instructions. When
    GOEXPERIMENT=clobberdead is on, it inserts clobbers nearly at
    every instruction. Currently this doesn't work. (Maybe the stack
    maps at non-call safepoints are still imprecise. I haven't
    investigated.) For now, only use call-based safepoints if the
    experiment is on.
    
    Updates #27326.
