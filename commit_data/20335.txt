    net/http/httptest: fix deadlock in TestIssue7264
    
    I am seeing deadlocks waiting on <-inHandler.
    It seems to me that there is no guarantee that the
    handler actually runs, if the client does
    
            write header
            close connection
    
    fast enough. The server might see the EOF on the
    connection before it manages to invoke the handler.
    
    This change fixes the deadlock, but it may make
    the test not actually test anything. Not sure.
