    cmd/go/internal/modload: track conflicts in versionLimiter
    
    This significantly simplifies the implementation of editRequirements
    in preparation for making it lazy. It should have no effect on which
    version combinations are rejected by 'go get', nor on which solutions
    are found if downgrades are needed.
    
    This change results in a small but observable change in error logging.
    Before, we were reporting an error line for each argument that would
    have exceeded its specified version, attributing it to one arbitrary
    cause. Now, we are reporting an error line for each argument that
    would cause any other argument to exceed its specified version. As a
    result, if one argument would cause two others to exceed their
    versions, we will now report one line instead of two; if two arguments
    would independently cause one other to exceed its version, we will now
    report two lines instead of one.
    
    This change may result in a small performance improvement. Because we
    are now scanning and rejecting incompatible requirements earlier, we
    may waste less time computing upgrades and downgrades that ultimately
    won't matter due to conflicting constraints.
    
    For #36460
