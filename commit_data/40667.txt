    cmd/compile: fix range analysis of small signed integers
    
    For int8, int16, and int32, comparing their unsigned value to MaxInt64
    to determine non-negativity doesn't make sense, because they have
    negative values whose unsigned representation is smaller than that.
    Fix is simply to compare with the appropriate upper bound based on the
    value type's size.
    
    Fixes #32560.
