    cmd/go: remove arbitrary sleep in TestScript/test_chatty_parallel_success_sleepy
    
    (Also rename it to no longer describe itself in terms of sleeping.)
    
    This test previously relied on the scheduler to wake up a goroutine to
    write the "--- PASS: TestFast" line within 100ms of TestFast actually
    finishing. On some platforms, even that long a delay is apparently too
    short.
    
    Instead, we now use a deterministic "=== RUN" line instead of a
    timing-dependent "--- PASS" line to interrupt the output.
    
    Fixes #51221
