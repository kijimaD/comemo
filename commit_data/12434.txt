    deps: allow crypto/x509 cgo and io/ioutil.
    
    In order to land 5700087 (which moves the knowledge of how to get the
    root certificates for the system from crypto/tls to crypto/x509), we
    need to relax the restrictions on crypto/x509. Afterwards, we can
    probably tighten them up in crypto/tls.
