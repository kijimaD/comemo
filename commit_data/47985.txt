    runtime: don't test sig.inuse in sigsend
    
    Signals can be delivered on a different thread. There is no necessary
    happens-before relationship between setting sig.inuse in signal_enable
    and checking it in sigsend. It is theoretically possible, if unlikely,
    that sig.inuse is set by thread 1, thread 2 receives a signal, does not
    see that sig.inuse is set, and discards the signal. This could happen
    if the signal is received immediately after the first call to signal_enable.
    
    For #33174
