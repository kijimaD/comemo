    html: dump attributes when running parser tests.
    
    The WebKit test data shows attributes as though they were child nodes:
    
    <a X>0<b>1<a Y>2
    dumps as:
    | <html>
    |   <head>
    |   <body>
    |     <a>
    |       x=""
    |       "0"
    |       <b>
    |         "1"
    |     <b>
    |       <a>
    |         y=""
    |         "2"
    
    So we need to do the same when dumping a tree to compare with it.
