    cmd/go: report non-Go files as package error
    
    This change modifies cmd/go/list to format the error correctly in case
    -e flag is set. It also fixes a bug where the package loader was only
    ever checking the first pattern if it had the go extension. This caused
    and error when a file without .go extension was not the first argument.
    
    Fixes #29899
