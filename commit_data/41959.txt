    cmd/asm/internal/asm/testdata/s390x: add test cases for some assembly instructions
    
    From CL 199979, I noticed that there were some
    instructions not covered by the test cases. Added those in this CL.
    
    Additional tests for assembly instructions are also added
    based on suggestions made during the review of this CL.
    
    Previously, VSB and VSH are not included in asmz.go, they were also
    added in this patch.
