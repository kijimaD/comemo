    runtime: make mSpanStateBox accessors nosplit
    
    get, at least, is called from typedmemclr which must not be interruptible.
    These were previously nosplit by accident before CL 424395 (the only
    call they had was an intrinsic, so they were leaf functions, so they had
    no prologue). After CL 424395 they contained a call (in noinline builds),
    thus had a prologue, thus had a suspension point.
    
    I have no idea how we might test this.
    
    This is another motivating use case for having a nosplitrec directive
    in the runtime.
