    runtime/debug: clarify SetCrashOutput dup behavior
    
    SetCrashOutput dup's the input file for safety, but I don't think that
    the docs are very clear about what the caller can/should do with f. "it
    does not close the previous file" is particularly confusing, as it does
    close the previous FD (but not the previous passed os.File).
    
    Expand and attempt to clarify the explanation, borrowing wording from
    net.FileConn, which also dup's the input os.File.
    
    For #42888.
