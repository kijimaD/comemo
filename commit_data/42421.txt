    [dev.link] cmd/link: expand set of symbol attributes in loader
    
    Add in a collection of new loader interfaces for getting/setting
    symbol attributes, e.g. properties that would normally be part of the
    sym.Symbol "Attr" field. This change also moves references to the
    loaders 'reachable' bitmap behind a pair of loader methods, so that we
    a consistent way of accessing symbol attributes overall. It is worth
    noting that not every symbol attribute is backed by a bitmap; for some
    infrequently used attributes, a map[Sym]struct{} is used instead.
