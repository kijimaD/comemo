    test: adjust bug324 to expect run-time failure, not compile-time.
    
    Failing at compile time requires that for each conversion
    between two interface types the compiler compare the sets of
    unexported methods to see if they come from different
    packages.  Since this test will fail approximately never on
    real code, and since it can't catch all cases of the problem,
    I don't think it's worth testing in the compiler.  This CL
    changes this test to look for a run-time panic rather than a
    compile-time error.
