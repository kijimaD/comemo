    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: fix encoding of 32-bit negated logical instructions
    
    32-bit negated logical instructions (BICW, ORNW, EONW) with
    constants were mis-encoded, because they were missing in the
    cases where we handle 32-bit logical instructions. This CL
    adds the missing cases.
    
    Fixes #28548
