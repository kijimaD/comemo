    net/http: fix ProxyFromEnvironment panic on invalid $NO_PROXY value
    
    Given an entry in $no_proxy like ":1" we would interpret it as an empty
    host name and a port number, then check the first character of the host
    name for dots. This would then cause an index out of range panic. This
    change simply skips these entries, as the following checks would anyway
    have returned false.
    
    Fixes #19536
