    crypto/elliptic: p224Contract could produce a non-minimal representation.
    
    I missed an overflow in contract because I suspected that the prime
    elimination would take care of it. It didn't, and I forgot to get back
    to the overflow. Because of this, p224Contract may have produced a
    non-minimal representation, causing flakey failures ~0.02% of the
    time.
