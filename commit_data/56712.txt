    Revert "runtime: improve runtime-internal mutex profile tests"
    
    This reverts commit f9ba2cff2286d378eca28c841bea8488c69fc30e (CL 586237)
    
    Reason for revert: This is part of a patch series that changed the
    handling of contended lock2/unlock2 calls, reducing the maximum
    throughput of contended runtime.mutex values, and causing a performance
    regression on applications where that is (or became) the bottleneck.
    
    This test verifies that the semantics of the mutex profile for
    runtime.mutex values matches that of sync.Mutex values. Without the rest
    of the patch series, this test would correctly identify that Go 1.22's
    semantics are incorrect (issue #66999).
    
    Updates #66999
    Updates #67585
