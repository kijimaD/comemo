    cmd/dist: drop wasitest from special list
    
    CL 498255 made runtime/internal/wasitest compatible with all platforms
    so that "go test std" works again. This means it no longer has to be
    in the special dist test list.
    
    While we're here explain the purpose of this list better and implore
    people to please not expand it, since almost any addition is a sign
    that "go test std cmd" no longer works.
