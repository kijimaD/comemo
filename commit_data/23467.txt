    cmd/asm: fix shifts again, this time for sure
    
    There are two conditions to worry about:
    
    1) The shift count cannot be negative. Since the evaluator uses unsigned
    arithmetic throughout, this means checking that the high bit of
    the shift count is always off, which is done by converting to int64
    and seeing if the result is negative.
    
    2) For right shifts, the value cannot be negative. We don't want a
    high bit in the value because right shifting a value depends on the
    sign, and for clarity we always want unsigned shifts.
    
    Next step is to build some testing infrastructure for the parser.
