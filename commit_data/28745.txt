    regexp: add the Fanout benchmark
    
    This is a copy of the "FANOUT" benchmark recently added to RE2 with the
    following comment:
    
        // This has quite a high degree of fanout.
        // NFA execution will be particularly slow.
    
    Most of the benchmarks on the regexp package have very little fanout and
    are designed for comparing the regexp package's NFA with backtracking
    engines found in other regular expression libraries. This benchmark
    exercises the performance of the NFA on expressions with high fanout.
