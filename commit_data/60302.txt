    cmd/compile/internal: add a PGO devirt post-lookup cleanup hook
    
    The PGO-based devirtualization helper pgoir.addIndirectEdges makes a
    series of calls into the unified IR reader to import functions that
    would not normally be imported but may be the target of a hot indirect
    call from the current package. This importing primarily targets at
    non-generic functions and methods, but as part of the process we can
    encounter types that have methods (including generic methods) whose
    bodies need to be read in. When the reader encounters an inlinable
    func of this sort, it may (depending on the context) decide not to
    read the body right away, but instead adds the func to a list
    ("todoBodies") to be read in later on in a more convenient context.
    
    In the bug in question, a hot method lookup takes place in
    pgoir.addIndirectEdges, and as part of the import process we wind up
    with a type T with method M that is in this partially created state,
    and in addition T gets added to the unified IR's list of types that
    may need method wrappers. During wrapper generation we create a new
    wrapper "(*T).M" whose body has a call to "T.M", then farther on down
    the pike during escape analysis we try to analyze the two functions;
    this causes a crash due to "T.M" being in partially constructed state.
    
    As a fix, add a new "PostLookupCleanup" hook (in the unified IR
    reader) that pgoir.addIndirectEdges can invoke that takes care of
    reading in the bodies of any functions that have been added to the
    "todoBodies" list.
    
    [Note: creating a test case for this problem is proving to be very
    tricky; a new test will be added in a subsequent patch].
    
    Fixes #67746.
