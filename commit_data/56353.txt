    runtime/trace: enable frame pointer unwinding by default for amd64 and arm64
    
    Re-enable frame pointer unwinding for execution tracing on amd64 by
    default, now that CL 489015 and CL 488755 have fixed recently-discovered
    crashes. This reverts CL 486382.
    
    These fixes, together with CL 241158 to fix up frame pointers when
    copying stacks on arm64, also make frame pointer unwinding for tracing
    safe to enable for arm64. This should significantly reduce the CPU and
    latency overhead of execution tracing on arm64, as it has for amd64.
