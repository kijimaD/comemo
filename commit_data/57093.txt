    path/filepath: avoid assuming that GOROOT/test is present
    
    GOROOT/test is pruned out by cmd/distpack. It isn't really needed for
    the test anyway; the test can instead use the "src/unicode" subdirectory,
    which is even within the same module.
    
    This test was previously adjusted in CL 13467045 and CL 31859.
    
    Unlike in previous iterations of the test, the directories used in
    this revision are covered by the Go 1 compatibility policy and thus
    unlikely to disappear.
    
    For #24904.
