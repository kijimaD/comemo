    crypto/x509: give type hint in error message in marshalPublicKey
    
    Currently if type of public key is unsupported, error message is "only
    RSA and ECDSA public keys supported". After adding Ed25519 this message
    is no longer correct.
    
    Moreover, it is superfluous because documentation for
    MarshalPKIXPublicKey, CreateCertificateRequest and CreateCertificate
    already lists supported public key types.
    
    This CL removes unnecessary details from error message.
    It also adds reporting the type of unsupported key, which helps
    debugging cases when struct (instead of a pointer) to otherwise correct
    public key is given.
    
    Fixes #32640
