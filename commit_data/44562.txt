    internal/goversion: update Version to 1.16
    
    This is the start of the Go 1.16 development cycle, so update the
    Version value accordingly. It represents the Go 1.x version that
    will soon open up for development (and eventually become released).
    
    Historically, we used to bump this at an arbitrary time throughout
    the development cycle, but it's better to be more predictable about
    updating it. The start of a development cycle should be the most
    appropriate time: it clearly marks the boundary between 1.15 and
    1.16 development, and doing it early can help catch issues in other
    tooling. See issue #38704 for more background.
    
    There is no longer a need to update the list of Go versions in
    src/go/build/doc.go because it does not exist as of CL 232981.
    
    For #40705.
    Updates #38704.
    Updates #37018.
