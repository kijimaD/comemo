    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: simplify huge frame prologue
    
    CL 307010 for ppc64.
    
    I spent a long time trying to figure out how to use the carry bit from
    ADDCCC to further simplify this (like what we do on arm64), but gave
    up after I couldn't figure out how to access the carry bit without
    just adding more instructions.
