    net/url: support query string without values
    
    Previously, RawQuery was used to indicate the presence of a query
    string in url.URL. However, this approach was not able to differentiate
    between URLs that have no query string at all (http://foo.bar/) and
    those that have a query with no values (http://foo.bar/?).
    
    Add a ForceQuery field to indicate the latter form of URL and use it
    in URL.String to create a matching URL with a trailing '?'.
    
    Fixes #13488
