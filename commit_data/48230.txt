    cmd/link/internal: fix use of DynlinkingGo with ppc64le trampolines
    
    When creating programs with large text sections on ppc64le,
    trampolines are needed for calls that are too far; however
    they are not created if the code is generated such that the TOC
    register r2 is initialized and maintained in the code because
    then the external linker can create the trampolines. Previously
    the function DynlinkingGo was used to determine this but in the
    case where plugins are used, this could return true even though
    r2 is not valid.
    
    To fix this problem I've added a new function r2Valid which returns
    true when the build options indicate that the r2 is
    initialized and maintained. Because of the ways that
    DynlinkingGo is used I wanted to maintain its previous
    behavior.
    
    Fixes #45850
