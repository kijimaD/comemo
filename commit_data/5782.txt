    test/fixedbugs/bug243.go: instead of closing stdout,
    remove the print statements.
    
    This change is because of the port of gccgo to RTEMS.
    These tests use the GCC DejaGNU framework. In some cases,
    the tests need to be run on qemu where the status code
    cannot be sent back to DejaGNU, so it prints the exit status
    by putting a wrapper around the exit and abort calls.
    
    This testcase closes the stdout, and hence prohibits DejaGNU
    from knowing the status in such cases, and causes this test
    to be wrongly declared as a failure.
