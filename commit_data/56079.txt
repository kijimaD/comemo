    cmd/link, cmd/internal/obj/loong64: support the PCALIGN directive
    
    Allow writing `PCALIGN $imm` where imm is a power-of-2 between 8 and
    2048 (inclusive), for ensuring that the following instruction is
    placed at an imm-byte boundary relative to the beginning of the
    function. If the PC is not sufficiently aligned, NOOPs will be
    inserted to make it so, otherwise the directive will do nothing.
    
    This could be useful for both asm performance hand-tuning, and future
    scenarios where a certain bigger alignment might be required.
