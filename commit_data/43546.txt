    [dev.link] cmd/link: don't split container symbols when write blocks
    
    We split the output into blocks and write them in parallel. The
    block boundary is placed at symbol boundary. In the case of outer
    symbols and sub symbols, currently we may split an outer symbol
    into two blocks. This will be bad, as the two blocks will have
    overlapping address range, since outer symbol and its sub symbols
    occupies the same address range.
    
    Make sure we place block boundary only at top-level symbol
    boundaries.
    
    Fix boringcrypto build.
