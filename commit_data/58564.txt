    cmd/compile/internal/ir: add CallExpr.GoDefer
    
    The devirtualizer and inliner both want to recognize call expressions
    that are part of a go or defer statement. This CL refactors them to
    use a single CallExpr.GoDefer flag, which gets set during
    normalization of go/defer statements during typecheck.
    
    While here, drop some OCALLMETH assertions. Typecheck has been
    responsible for desugaring them into OCALLFUNC for a while now, and
    ssagen will check this again for us later anyway.
