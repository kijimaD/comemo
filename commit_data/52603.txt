    cmd/go: copy files from go/build into new modindex package
    
    These files are all copied as is from the go/build package, to files
    with the same name in modindex (with the exception of build_read, which
    was copied from go/build/read.go).
    
    This is being done so that the next CL can show exactly the changes that
    were made against the go/build versions.
    
    Unfortunately, git doesn't recognize these as copies, which is annoying.
