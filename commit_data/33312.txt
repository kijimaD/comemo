    archive/tar: implement specialized logic for USTAR format
    
    Rather than going through the complicated logic of writeHeader,
    implement a writeUSTARHeader that only knows about the USTAR format.
    This makes the logic much easier to reason about since you only
    need to be concerned about USTAR and not all the subtle
    differences between USTAR, PAX, and GNU.
    
    We seperate out the logic in writeUSTARHeader into templateV7Plus
    and writeRawHeader since the planned implementations of
    writePAXHeader and writeGNUHeader will use them.
