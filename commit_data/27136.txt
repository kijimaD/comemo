    runtime: avoid span root marking entirely during mark termination
    
    Currently we enqueue span root mark jobs during both concurrent mark
    and mark termination, but we make the job a no-op during mark
    termination.
    
    This is silly. Instead of queueing them up just to not do them, don't
    queue them up in the first place.
