    runtime: don't skip timer when adjustTimers sees a modified timer
    
    When adjustTimers sees a timerModifiedEarlier or timerModifiedLater,
    it removes it from the heap, leaving a new timer at that position
    in the heap. We were accidentally skipping that new timer in our loop.
    In some unlikely cases this could cause adjustTimers to look at more
    timers than necessary.
