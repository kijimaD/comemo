    runtime: report MemStats.PauseEnd in UNIX time
    
    Currently we report MemStats.PauseEnd in nanoseconds, but with no
    particular 0 time. On Linux, the 0 time is when the host started. On
    Darwin, it's the UNIX epoch. This is also inconsistent with the other
    absolute time in MemStats, LastGC, which is always reported in
    nanoseconds since 1970.
    
    Fix PauseEnd so it's always reported in nanoseconds since 1970, like
    LastGC.
    
    Fixes one of the issues raised in #10323.
