    cmd/cover: do not report coverage for assembly functions
    
    cover -func mode was reporting a coverage for function
    declarations without bodies - assembly functions.
    Since we are not annotating their code, we have no data
    for those functions and should not report them at all.
    
    Fixes #6880.
