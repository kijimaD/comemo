    runtime/pprof: assert that labelHog samples are always labeled
    
    With https://golang.org/issue/50007 resolved, there are no known issues
    with pprof labels remaining. Thus, the 10% allowed error in
    TestLabelSystemstack should not be required.
    
    Drop it in favor of an explicit assertion that all samples containing
    labelHog are properly labeled.
    
    This is no flaky in my local testing. It is possible that other bugs
    will appear at larger testing scale, in which case this CL will be
    reverted, but then at least we will be aware of additional failure
    modes.
    
    For #50007.
