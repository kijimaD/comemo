    text/template: provide a mechanism for options
    
    Add one option, which is the motivating example, a way to control
    what happens when a map is indexed with a key that is not in the map.
    Rather than do something specific for that case, we provide a simple
    general option mechanism to avoid adding API if something else
    comes up. This general approach also makes it easy for html/template
    to track (and adapt, should that become important).
    
    New method: Option(option string...). The option strings are key=value
    pairs or just simple strings (no =).
    
    New option:
    
     missingkey: Control the behavior during execution if a map is
     indexed with a key that is not present in the map.
            "missingkey=default" or "missingkey=invalid"
                    The default behavior: Do nothing and continue execution.
                    If printed, the result of the index operation is the string
                    "<no value>".
            "missingkey=zero"
                    The operation returns the zero value for the map type's element.
            "missingkey=error"
                    Execution stops immediately with an error.
    
    Fixes #6288.
