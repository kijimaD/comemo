    runtime: enable preemption of mark termination goroutine
    
    A mark worker goroutine may attempt to preempt the mark termination
    goroutine to scan its stack while the mark termination goroutine is
    trying to preempt that worker to flush its work buffer, in rare
    cases.
    
    This change makes it so that, like a worker goroutine, the mark
    termination goroutine stack is preemptible while it is on the
    system stack, attempting to preempt others.
    
    Fixes #28695.
