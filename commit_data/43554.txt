    [dev.link] cmd/link/internal/loader: get rid of the AttrContainer loader method
    
    Remove the loader's AttrContainer method, since it is no longer
    needed. All of the code in the linker that used s.Attr.Container() is
    now upstream of loadlibfull(), and the code in question now uses local
    bitmaps to keep track of container text symbols as opposed to loader
    methods.
