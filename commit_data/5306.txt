    json: scanner, Compact, Indent, and tests
    
    This is the first of probably four separate CLs
    for the new implementation of the json package.
    
    The scanner is the core of the new implementation.
    The other CLs would be the new decoder,
    the new encoder, and support for JSON streams.
