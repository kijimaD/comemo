    runtime: revert recent Windows crashdump changes
    
    Recent changes to runtime enabled crashdumps, which under some
    circumstances apparently might result in memory being uploaded to
    Microsoft. A change like this should go through the proper proposals
    process where we can discuss how to gate it and what all of its
    implications are.
    
    This reverts CL 307372 and its cleanup CL 360617.
