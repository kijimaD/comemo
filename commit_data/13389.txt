    encoding/json: simplify (*decodeState).indirect
    
    Removes an incorrect code comment and some superfluous variables.
    
    The comment I removed says that struct fields which implement
    Unmarshaler must be pointers, even if they're in an addressable
    struct. That's not the case, and there's already a test in decode_test.go
    that demonstrates as much.
    
    Encoding/json has quite a few assignments of reflect.Values to extra
    variables â€“ things like "iv := v" when there's no need to make a copy. I
    think these are left over from a previous version of the reflect API. If they
    aren't wanted, I wouldn't mind going through the package and getting
    rid of the rest of them.
