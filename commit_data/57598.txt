    cmd/link: don't mangle string symbol names
    
    String symbol names could contain weird characters as we put the
    string literal into the symbol name. So it may appear to need
    mangling. However, as string symbols are grouped into a single
    "go:string.*" symbol, the individual symbol names actually don't
    matter. So don't mangle them.
    
    Also make the mangling code more defensive in case of weird
    symbol names.
    
    Fixes #62098.
