    cmd/compile: fix typechecking in finishcompare
    
    Previously, finishcompare just used SetTypecheck, but this didn't
    recursively update any untyped bool typed subexpressions. This CL
    changes it to call typecheck, which correctly handles this.
    
    Also cleaned up outdated code for simplifying logic.
    
    Updates #23834
