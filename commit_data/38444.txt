    os: only fallback to root directory if $HOME fails for UserHomeDir
    
    UserHomeDir always returns "/" for platforms where the home directory
    is not always well defined. However, the user might set HOME before
    running a Go program on those platforms and on at least iOS, HOME
    is actually set to something useful (the root of the app specific
    writable directory).
    
    This CL changes UserHomeDir to use the root directory "/" only if
    $HOME is empty.
