    crypto/hmac: rename CheckHMAC to ValidHMAC in package docs
    
    Procedure names should reflect what they do; function names
    should reflect what they return. Functions are used in
    expressions, often in things like if's, so they need
    to read appropriately.
    
            if CheckHMAC(a, b, key)
    
    is unhelpful because we can't deduce whether CheckHMAC
    returns true on error or nonÂ­-error; instead
    
            if ValidHMAC(a, b, key)
    
    makes the point clear and makes a future mistake
    in using the routine less likely.
