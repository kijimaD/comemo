    cmd,runtime: enable race detector on loong64
    
    The race feature depends on llvm. And support for building the tsan library on
    linux/loong64 has been added in this patch [1], which has been merged into the
    branch main and has landed in llvm18.
    
    The support for linux/loong64 in racebuild has been implemented in CL 655775,
    now racebuild can successfully build race_linux_loong64.syso [2].
