    runtime: make mheap.pagesInUse an atomic.Uintptr
    
    This change fixes an old TODO that made it a uint64 because it would
    make alignment within mheap more complicated. Now that we don't have to
    worry about it since we're using atomic types as much as possible,
    switch to using a Uintptr. This likely will improve performance a tiny
    bit on 32-bit platforms, but really it's mostly cleanup.
