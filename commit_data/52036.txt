    cmd/go: allow either test to complete first in TestScript/test_chatty_parallel_success_run
    
    This fixes a failure mode observed in
    https://build.golang.org/log/7b28a914b1914dabe94f7c4e36ad6466ebd4de5d,
    in which the expected CONT lines are present but the test completions
    are reported in a different (but valid) order.
    
    CONT lines are only printed between interleaved output lines, so if
    the ordering of the tests swaps after all output is already generated
    the PASS lines can be in arbitrary order.
    
    Fixes #51221 (again).
