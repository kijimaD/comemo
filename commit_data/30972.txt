    .gitignore: fix attempt at rooted paths
    
    When I wrote the lines
    
            bin/
            pkg/
    
    I was trying to match just the top-level bin and pkg directories, and I put the
    final slash in because 'git help gitignore' says:
    
           o   If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell
               glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative
               to the location of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of
               the work tree if not from a .gitignore file).
    
           o   Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for
               consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in
               the pattern will not match a / in the pathname. For example,
               "Documentation/*.html" matches "Documentation/git.html" but not
               "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or
               "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".
    
    Putting a trailing slash was my way of opting in to the "rooted path" semantics
    without looking different from the surrounding rooted paths like "src/go/build/zcgo.go".
    
    But HA HA GIT FOOLED YOU! above those two bullets the docs say:
    
           o   If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of
               the following description, ...
    
    Change all the patterns to use a leading slash for "rooted" behavior.
    
    This bit me earlier today because I had a perfectly reasonable source
    code directory go/src/cmd/go/testdata/src/empty/pkg that was
    not added by 'git add empty'.
