    runtime: use correct truncated constants for float conversion
    
    There is a range of numbers lower than 0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffff which
    cannot be represented by a 64 bit float. We set that to the correct
    limit beyond which conversions can happen properly.
    
    It appears that the negative bound check can indeed by correctly handled
    by I64TruncF64S. But we use the same limit for consistency.
    
    Fixes #38839
