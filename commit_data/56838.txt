    runtime: add heapObjectsCanMove
    
    heapObjectsCanMove is always false in the current garbage collector.
    It exists for go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc, which is an
    unfortunate idea that had an even more unfortunate implementation.
    Every time a new Go release happened, the package stopped building,
    and the authors had to add a new file with a new //go:build line, and
    then the entire ecosystem of packages with that as a dependency had to
    explicitly update to the new version. Many packages depend on
    assume-no-moving-gc transitively, through paths like
    inet.af/netaddr -> go4.org/intern -> assume-no-moving-gc.
    This was causing a significant amount of friction around each new
    release, so we added this bool for the package to //go:linkname
    instead. The bool is still unfortunate, but it's not as bad as
    breaking the ecosystem on every new release.
    
    If the Go garbage collector ever does move heap objects, we can set
    this to true to break all the programs using assume-no-moving-gc.
