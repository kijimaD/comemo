    reflect: correct type descriptor for call of interface method
    
    When preparing a call with an interface method, the argument
    frame holds the receiver "iword", but funcLayout was being
    asked to write a descriptor as if the receiver were a complete
    interface value. This was originally caught by running a large
    program with Debug=3 in runtime/mgc0.c, but the new panic
    in funcLayout suffices to catch the mistake with the existing
    tests.
    
    Fixes #7748.
