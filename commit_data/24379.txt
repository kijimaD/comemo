    net/http/fcgi: fix panic with malformed params record
    
    As stated in FastCGI specifications:
    
    FastCGI transmits a name-value pair as the length of the name,
    followed by the length of the value, followed by the name,
    followed by the value.
    
    The current implementation trusts the name and value length
    provided in the record, leading to a panic if the record
    is malformed.
    
    Added an explicit check on the lengths.
    
    Test case and fix suggested by diogin@gmail.com (Jingcheng Zhang)
    
    Fixes #11824
