    cmd/cgo: fix line number annotations in generated C code
    
    The old version was using go/ast's CommentGroup.Text method,
    but that method drops leading blank lines from the result, so that
    if the comment looked like one of
    
    //
    // syntax error
    import "C"
    
    /*
    syntax error
    */
    import "C"
    
    then the line numbers for the syntax error would be off by the
    number of leading blank lines (1 in each of the above cases).
    
    The new text extractor preserves blank lines.
    
    Fixes #4019.
