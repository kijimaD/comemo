    runtime: don't do a plain throw when throwsplit == true
    
    The test case in #15639 somehow causes an invalid syscall frame. The
    failure is obscured because the throw occurs when throwsplit == true,
    which causes a "stack split at bad time" error when trying to print the
    throw message.
    
    This CL fixes the "stack split at bad time" by using systemstack. No
    test because there shouldn't be any way to trigger this error anyhow.
    
    Update #15639.
