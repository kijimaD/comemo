    cmd/compile: update builtin writeBarrier to match runtime
    
    The definition of writeBarrier in the runtime was changed in CL 22855
    to include padding. Update the definition built in to the compiler to match.
    This doesn't affect the generated code, as the compiler sets the type
    to use anyhow, but having them be different seems clearly wrong.
