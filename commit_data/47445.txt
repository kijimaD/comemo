    cmd/compile/internal/types2: make sure we are safe for nil in underIs
    
    Reviewed all uses of underIs (global function and method) and made
    sure we are ok with a nil incoming argument (indicating a type set
    with no specific types).
    
    Added a couple of checks where we didn't have them (and somehow
    didn't run into a problem yet).
