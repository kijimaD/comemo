    cmd/compile: negate comparision with FNES/FNED on riscv64
    
    The FNES and FNED instructions are pseudo-instructions, which the
    assembler expands to FEQS/NEG or FEQD/NEG - if we're comparing the
    result via a branch instruction, we can avoid an instruction by
    negating both the branch comparision and the floating point
    comparision.
    
    This only removes a handful of instructions from the Go binary,
    however, it will provide benefit to floating point intensive code.
