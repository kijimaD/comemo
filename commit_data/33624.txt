    database/sql: check for arg counts after eliminating arguments
    
    Check for the expected number of arguments in a SQL statement
    after arguments are eliminated in the argument converter.
    
    This situation was already tested for in TestNamedValueChecker.
    However the test used Exec which didn't have any check for
    NumInput on it at all, thus this issue was never caught.
    
    In addition to moving the NumInput check on the Query
    methods after the converter, add the NumInput check
    to the Exec methods as well.
    
    Fixes #22630
