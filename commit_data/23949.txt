    net/http: sync Get and Head's documentation
    
    Instead of ambiguously referring to "the Client's CheckRedirect
    function" in Head, describe the default behavior like for Get as users
    aren't expected to change DefaultClient.CheckRedirect.
    
    While here, use consistent punctuation for the Get and Head Client
    method documentation.
