    mime: derestrict value backslash unescaping for all encodings
    
    Previously consumeValue performed consumption of "unnecessary backslashes"
    strictly for non-ASCII and non-token runes. Thus if it encountered a
    backslash before a rune that is out of the ASCII range, it would
    erroneously skip that backslash. This change now derestricts
    "unnecessary backslash" unescaping for all character encodings,
    using "isTSpecial" instead of "!isTokenChar".
    This change is a follow-up of CL 32175.
    
    Fixes #25888
