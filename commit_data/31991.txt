    doc/go1.9: discuss runtime.Callers
    
    A lot of code that uses runtime.Callers makes assumptions about the
    result that are not true today under gccgo and will not be true in the
    future in gc. This adds a section to the release notes discussing how
    to correctly use runtime.Callers.
