    cmd/compile: adjust expectations of test for issue 18902
    
    The test for #18902 reads the assembly stream to be sure
    that the line number does not change too often (this is an
    indication that debugging the code will be unpleasant and
    that the compiler is probably getting line numbers "wrong").
    
    It checks that it is getting "enough" input, but the
    compiler has gotten enough better since the test was written
    that it now fails for lack of enough input.  The old
    threshould was 200 instructions, the new one is 150 (the
    minimum observed input is on arm64 with 184 instructions).
    
    Fixes #22494.
