    os: clearer doc for Interrupt
    
    I was confused by the juxtaposition of os.Interrupt docs, which are
    "guaranteed to exist on all platforms" in one sentence and then
    "not implemented" in the next sentence. Reading the code reveals
    "not implemented" refers specifically to the implementation of
    os.Process.Signal on Windows, not to the os.Interrupt variable itself.
    Reword the doc to make this distinction clearer.
    
    Fixes #27854.
