    net: handle >=2GiB files with sendfile on Windows
    
    CL 187037 applied a fix to handle the case where
    files larger than 2GiB were not being sendfile-d,
    in one shot, rejecting any files whose size was
    larger than the 2GiB.
    
    This CL allows files that are larger than limit
    by SendFile-ing in chunks of upto 2GiB per chunk.
    
    The test has been excluded as testing with 3GB
    requires creating a local file, flushing it
    and then doing sendfile which takes a while
    and could cause flakes on computers without capacity,
    but the test can be retroactively accessed at:
    https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/192518/8/src/net/sendfile_windows_test.go
    
    Fixes #33193.
