    cmd/compile: remove redundant switch label
    
    This label was added automatically by grind to remove gotos. As of
    today, it's completely useless, as none of its uses need a label to
    begin with.
    
    While at it, remove all the redundant breaks too. Leave those that are
    the single statement in a case clause body, as that's the style used
    throughout std and cmd to clarify when cases are empty.
