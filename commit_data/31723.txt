    cmd/link: add -importcfg to specify import resolution
    
    Adds the ability to specify the file location of each imported package,
    like in the -importcfg added to cmd/compile in a related CL.
    In effect, -importcfg is a generalization of and supersedes -installsuffix
    and -L. Of course, those flags will continue to be supported, for
    compatibility with other tools.
    
    Having this flag in Go 1.9 will let us try some experiments involving
    package management without needing guinea pigs to build a custom
    Go toolchain.
    
    This flag also helps with #14271 at some later point.
    
    For #20579.
