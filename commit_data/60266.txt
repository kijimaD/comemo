    runtime: add a note on SetFinalizer doc about method receiver
    
    A method receiver can be collected during the execution of that method.
    This does make sense when thinking about how the GC would work, but
    also seems not very obvious, so a point in the docs can increase the
    chance of avoiding issues caused by missing KeepAlive of method
    receivers.
