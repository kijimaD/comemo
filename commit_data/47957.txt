    go/types: remove the concept of finals
    
    Checker.finals and the corresponding atEnd were added in CL 191418 as a
    mechanism to postpone interface type comparison until after all
    interfaces were complete. In the intervening CL 195837 we've adopted a
    convention of ensuring that interfaces are complete before comparing
    them. Since then we've also added the additional case of expansion for
    lazily resolving syntax.
    
    Checker.later defers resolution of types until points in the checking
    pass where all reachable types can be fully type checked, so the concept
    of finals should no longer be necessary.
