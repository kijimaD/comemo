    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: get runtime stuff working
    
    Remaining stuff from Dan's CL 335412 to get tests passing.
    
     - Removed PTRLIT case in node() that was added with the gcshape change.
       I don't think it is needed anymore.
    
     - Modified (*itab).init() to add an irrelevant pointer (the itab
       itself) for the '==' entry of interfaces with 'comparable'. That
       entry is not used, so we just want to avoid the error that the given
       type doesn't actually have an '==' method.
