    os: fix Args setup on Windows
    
    Should fix the Windows build. Untested.
    
    on Windows, args are made by src/os/exec_windows.go, not package runtime.
    runtimeÂ·goargs has if(Windows) return;
    
    The two init funcs in pkg os were conflicting, with the second
    overwriting Args back to an empty slice.
