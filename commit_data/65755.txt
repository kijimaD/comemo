 ### WebAssembly {#wasm}
 
+<!-- go.dev/issue/65199, CL 603055 -->
+The `go:wasmexport` directive is added for Go programs to export functions to the WebAssembly host.
+
+On WebAssembly System Interface Preview 1 (`GOOS=wasip1, GOARCH=wasm`), Go 1.24 supports
+building a Go program as a
+[reactor/library](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/63a46f61052a21bfab75a76558485cf097c0dbba/legacy/application-abi.md#current-unstable-abi),
+by specifying the `-buildmode=c-shared` build flag.
+
+<!-- go.dev/issue/66984, CL 626615 -->
+More types are now permitted as argument or result types for `go:wasmimport` functions.
+Specifically, `bool`, `string`, `uintptr`, and pointers to certain types are allowed
+(see the [proposal](/issue/66984) for detail),
+along with 32-bit and 64-bit integer and float types, and `unsafe.Pointer`, which
+are already allowed.
+These types are also permitted as argument or result types for `go:wasmexport` functions.
+
 <!-- go.dev/issue/68024 -->
 The support files for WebAssembly have been moved to `lib/wasm` from `misc/wasm`.
