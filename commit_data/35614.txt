    cmd/compile: fix panic-okay-to-inline change; adjust tests
    
    This line of the inlining tuning experiment
    https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/109918/1/src/cmd/compile/internal/gc/inl.go#347
    was incorrectly rewritten in a later patch to use the call
    cost, not the panic cost, and thus the inlining of panic
    didn't occur when it should.  I discovered this when I
    realized that tests should have failed, but didn't.
    
    Fix is to make the correct change, and also to modify the
    tests that this causes to fail.  One test now asserts the
    new normal, the other calls "ppanic" instead which is
    designed to behave like panic but not be inlined.
