    runtime: disable TestArenaCollision on Darwin in race mode
    
    This change disables the test TestArenaCollision on Darwin in race mode
    to deal with the fact that Darwin 10.10 must use MAP_FIXED in race mode
    to ensure we retain our heap in a particular portion of the address
    space which the race detector needs. The test specifically checks to
    make sure a manually mapped region's space isn't re-used, which is
    definitely possible with MAP_FIXED because it replaces whatever mapping
    already exists at a given address.
    
    This change then also makes it so that MAP_FIXED is only used in race
    mode and on Darwin, not all BSDs, because using MAP_FIXED breaks this
    test for FreeBSD in addition to Darwin.
    
    Updates #26475.
    Fixes #29340.
