    runtime: remove GODEBUG=gctrace=2 mode
    
    It turns out if you set GODEBUG=gctrace=2, it enables an obscure
    debugging mode that, in addition to printing gctrace statistics, also
    does a second STW GC following each regular GC. This debugging mode
    has long since lost its value (you could maybe use it to analyze
    floating garbage, except that we don't print the gctrace line on the
    second GC), and it interferes substantially with the operation of the
    GC by messing up the statistics used to schedule GCs.
    
    It's also a source of mark termination GC work when we're in
    concurrent GC mode, so it's going to interfere with eliminating mark
    2. And it's going to get in the way of unifying STW and concurrent GC.
    
    This CL removes this debugging mode.
    
    Updates #26903. This is preparation for eliminating mark 2 and
    unifying STW GC and concurrent GC.
