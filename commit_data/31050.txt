-## Binary Distribution Notes
+#### Install From Source
 
-If you have just untarred a binary Go distribution, you need to set
-the environment variable $GOROOT to the full path of the go
-directory (the one containing this file).  You can omit the
-variable if you unpack it into /usr/local/go, or if you rebuild
-from sources by running all.bash (see doc/install-source.html).
-You should also add the Go binary directory $GOROOT/bin
-to your shell's path.
+If a binary distribution is not available for your combination of
+operating system and architecture, visit
+https://golang.org/doc/install/source or load doc/install-source.html
+in your web browser for source installation instructions.
 
-For example, if you extracted the tar file into $HOME/go, you might
-put the following in your .profile:
+### Contributing
 
-	export GOROOT=$HOME/go
-	export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
