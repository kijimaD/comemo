    cmd/cover: rename temporary directory prefix for consistency
    
    This change renames the temporary directory prefix for testing to
    go-testcover from gotestcover. It looks like other packages have the
    "go-" prefix for temporary directories, such as go-build, go-tool-dist
    and go-nettest.
