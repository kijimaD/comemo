    test: use go tool from tree, not path
    
    Some of our tests do exec.Command("go", "tool", "compile", ...) or
    similar. That "go" is selected from PATH. When run.go is started
    from the command line (but not from all.bash), the first "go" is whatever
    happens to be first in the user's path (some random older version than
    tip). We really want all these tests to use the "go" tool from the
    source tree under test. Add GOROOT/bin to the front of the path to
    ensure that the tools we use come from the source tree under test.
