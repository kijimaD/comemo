    cmd/compile, reflect: treat abi.NoEscape as cheap call
    
    The abi.NoEscape function is introduced to replace all usages of
    noescape wrapper in the standard library. However, the last usage in
    reflect package is still present, because the inlining test failed if
    abi.NoEscape were used. The reason is that reflect.noescape is treated
    as a cheap call, while abi.NoEscape is not.
    
    By treating abi.NoEscape a cheap call, the last usage of noescape in
    reflect package can now be removed.
