commit f3d54789f764f0f6dba1d2f12ad01986d66ea31c

    cmd/compile: use power5 instructions for uint64 to float casts
    
    Use the same technique as mips64 for these casts (CL 22835).
    
    We could use the FCFIDU instruction for ppc64le however it seems
    better to keep it the same as ppc64 for now.
    
    Updates #15539, updates #16004.
