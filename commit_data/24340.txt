    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: use v.Args[x].Op in CSE key
    
    Experimentally, the Ops of v.Args do a good job
    of differentiating values that will end up in
    different partitions.
    
    Most values have at most two args, so use them.
    
    This reduces the wall time to run test/slice3.go
    on my laptop from ~20s to ~12s.
    
    Credit to Todd Neal for the idea.
