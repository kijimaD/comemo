    os: add UserConfigDir
    
    After UserCacheDir and UserHomeDir, the only remaining piece which is
    commonly needed and portable is a per-user directory to store persistent
    files.
    
    For that purpose, UserCacheDir is wrong, as it's meant only for
    temporary files. UserHomeDir is also far from ideal, as that clutters
    the user's home directory.
    
    Add UserConfigDir, which is implemented in a similar manner to
    UserConfigDir.
    
    Fixes #29960.
