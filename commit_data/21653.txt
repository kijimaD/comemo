    net/http/cgi: fix REMOTE_ADDR, REMOTE_HOST, add REMOTE_PORT
    
    Env vars were incorrectly copying whole value of http.RemoteAddr
    to REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_HOST. They contained IP:port pair which
    instead should only have IP (RFC 3875, other sources).
    
    Module also was not setting REMOTE_PORT variable which become de-facto
    standard for passing TCP client port to CGI scripts (Apache mod_cgi,
    IIS, and probably others)
    
    Fixes #9861
