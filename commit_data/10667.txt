    crypto/dsa: don't truncate input hashes.
    
    Although FIPS 186-3 says that we should truncate the hashes, at least
    one other library (libgcrypt) doesn't. This means that it's impossible
    to interoperate with code using gcrypt if we enforce the truncation
    inside of crypto/dsa.
    
    This change shouldn't actually affect anything because nearly
    everybody pairs DSA with SHA1, which doesn't need to be truncated in
    either case.
