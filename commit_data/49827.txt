    runtime: in adjustTimers back up as far as necessary
    
    When the adjustTimers function removed a timer it assumed it was
    sufficient to continue the heap traversal at that position.
    However, in some cases a timer will be moved to an earlier
    position in the heap. If that timer is timerModifiedEarlier,
    that can leave timerModifiedEarliest not correctly representing
    the earlier such timer.
    
    Fix the problem by restarting the heap traversal at the earliest
    changed position.
    
    Fixes #47762
