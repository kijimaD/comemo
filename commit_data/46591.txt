    cmd/compile: fix crawler for unexported fields with instantiated types
    
    In markType() in crawler.go, mark the type of a unexported field if it
    is a fully-instantiated type, since we create and instantiate the
    methods of any fully-instantiated type that we see during import. As
    before, we still do not mark the type of an unexported field if that
    type is not generic. Fixes #48454 and most recent issue described in
    48337. The included test is similar to the case in 48454.
    
    Fixes #48454
    Fixes #48337
