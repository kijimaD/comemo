    cmd/go: don't refuse to update a present package only because of its source configuration
    
    If a package is checked out in the right place, but uses, for instance,
    an unusual Git remote configuration, don't refuse to update just because
    cmd/go can't parse it. In most cases, `git pull -ff-only` (or the
    equivalent in other VCSes) works just fine.
    
    Updates #25432.
