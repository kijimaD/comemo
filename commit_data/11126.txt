    cmd/go: fix linker arguments
    
    Especially affects tests, but not test-specific.
    The linker was only being told where to find the
    direct dependencies of package main.  Sometimes that
    was sufficient to find the rest; sometimes not.
    
    Fixes #2657.
    Fixes #2666.
    Fixes #2680.
