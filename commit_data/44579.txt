    [dev.link] debug/gosym: fix file mappings
    
    CL 246497 introduced bugs in gosym that the long tests caught. These two
    bugs were:
    
    1) In 1.16, 0 is now a valid file number from pcfile tables.
    2) Also, in 1.16, when we scan all functions looking for a pc/file pair,
       the values returned from pcfile are no longer the direct offset into
       the file table. Rather, the values from pcfile are the offset into
       the cu->file look-up table.
    
    This CL fixes those two issues.
