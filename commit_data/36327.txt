    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: summarize the Go assembly syntax and the GNU syntax mapping rules
    
    The patch rewrites the content of doc.go file. The file describes some
    general rules of the mapping between Go assembly syntax and GNU syntax.
    And it gives some Go assembly examples and corresponding GNU assembly
    examples.
    
    The patch changes the doc.go to use standard doc comment format so that
    the link https://golang.org/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/ can display it.
