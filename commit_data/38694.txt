    cmd/link: fix isStmt DWARF info
    
    When CL 147160 introduced function ABIs encoded as symbol versions in
    the linker, it became slightly more complicated to look up derived
    DWARF symbols. It fixed this by introducing a dwarfFuncSym function to
    hide this logic, but missed one derived lookup that was done in the
    object reader itself. As a result, we lost the isStmt tables from the
    compiler, so every PC was marked as a statement in the DWARF info.
    
    Fix this by moving this derived lookup out of the object reader and
    into the DWARF code and calling dwarfFuncSym to get the correctly
    versioned symbol.
    
    Should fix the linux-amd64-longtest builder.
    
    Updates #27539.
