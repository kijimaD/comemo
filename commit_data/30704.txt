    cmd/link: handle STT_COMMON symbols
    
    Tested by running
    
    GOTRACEBACK=2 CGO_CFLAGS="-Wa,--elf-stt-common=yes" go test -ldflags=-linkmode=internal
    
    in misc/cgo/test. That failed before this CL, succeeded after.
    
    I don't think it's worth doing that as a regular test, though,
    especially since only recent versions of the GNU binutils support the
    --elf-stt-common option.
    
    Fixes #18088.
