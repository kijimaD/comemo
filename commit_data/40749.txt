    cmd/compile: don't mark argument array as noalg
    
    It ends up making two similar types, [N]uint8 of both
    alg and noalg varieties. Comparsions between the two then
    don't come out equal when they should.
    In particular, the type *[N]uint8 has an Elem pointer which
    must point to one of the above two types; it can't point to both.
    Thus allocating a *[N]uint8 and dereferencing it might be a
    different type than a [N]uint8.
    
    The fix is easy. Making a small test for this is really hard. It
    requires that both a argless defer and the test be imported by a
    common parent package. This is why a main binary doesn't see this
    issue, but a test does (as Agniva noticed), because there's a wrapper
    package that imports both the test and the defer.
    
    Types like [N]uint8 don't really need to be marked noalg anyway,
    as the generated code (if any) will be shared among all
    vanilla memory types of the same size.
    
    Fixes #32595
