    crypto/x509: keep the raw Subject and Issuer.
    
    X509 names, like everything else X509, are ludicrously general. This
    change keeps the raw version of the subject and issuer around for
    matching. Since certificates use a distinguished encoding, comparing
    the encoding is the same as comparing the values directly. This came
    up recently when parsing the NSS built-in certificates which use the
    raw subject and issuer for matching trust records to certificates.
