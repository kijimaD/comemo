    bytes, strings: add Replace
    
    This is the Replace I suggested in the review of CL 1114041.
    It's true that we already have
    
            regexp.MustCompile(regexp.QuoteMeta(old)).ReplaceAll(s, new)
    
    but because this Replace is doing a simpler job it is
    simpler to call and inherently more efficient.
    
    I will add the bytes implementation and tests to the
    CL after the strings one has been reviewed.
