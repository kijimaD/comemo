    [dev.fuzz] testing: capture coverage even if tRunner failed
    
    Call SnapshotCoverage when the fuzzFn panics, or t.Fatal(f) is called.
    We currently don't use this coverage for anything, but it is necessary
    to allow the coordinator to continue when loading a corpus that contains
    an input that causes crashes. We will also probably want this behavior
    once we allow the fuzzer to continue after finding a crasher, since the
    input used to find one crasher may be a useful input for further
    mutation.
    
    Fixes #46633
