commit 48bd13911de978effd30402253de523b8eb4bb11

    runtime: use GOTRACEBACK to decide whether to show runtime frames
    
    Right now, GOTRACEBACK=0 means do not show any stack traces.
    Unset means the default behavior (declutter by hiding runtime routines).
    
    This CL makes GOTRACEBACK=2 mean include the runtime routines.
    It avoids having to recompile the runtime when you want to see
    the runtime in the tracebacks.
