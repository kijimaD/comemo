    net: permit pollster DelFD to return whether to call Wakeup
    
    This is necessary for systems that use select as the pollster,
    such as Solaris (supported by gccgo).  It corresponds to the
    bool returned by AddFD.  In general it's not clearly defined
    what happens when a descriptor used in a select is closed, and
    different systems behave differently.  Waking up the select
    will cause the right thing to happen: the closed descriptor
    will be dropped from the next iteration.
