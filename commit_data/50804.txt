    net: add conversion from AddrPort to TCPAddr to complement existing inverse
    
    We already have various member functions of TCPAddr that return an
    AddrPort, but we don't have a helper function to go from a AddrPort to a
    TCPAddr. UDP has this, but it was left out of TCP. This commit adds the
    corresponding function.
    
    Updates #49298.
