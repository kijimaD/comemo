    net/http: add Request.RequestURI field
    
    The new url.URL's parsing can be too canonicalizing for
    certain applications. By keeping the original request URI
    around, we give applications a gross escape hatch while
    keeping the URL package clean and simple for normal uses.
    
    (From a discussion with Gary Burd, Gustavo Niemeyer,
    and Russ Cox.)
    
    Fixes #2782
