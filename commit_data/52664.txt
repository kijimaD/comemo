    io/fs: document requirement that ReadDir return an unwrapped io.EOF
    
    This requirement ensures that ReadDir implementations are as compatible
    as possible with "*os.File".ReadDir.
    
    The testing/fstest package already tests for equality to io.EOF.
    
    Updates #47062.
    Fixes #47086.
