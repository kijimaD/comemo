    cmd/go: add -d flag to mod_get_test
    
    'go get all' was run in this test without -d. This caused some std
    packages to be reinstalled if the test is run in a slightly different
    configuration than make.bash was run. run.bash would fail in some
    situations because of this. Nothing in the cmd/go tests should modify
    installed std or cmd packages.
    
    Updates #35459
