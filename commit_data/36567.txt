    misc/ios: uninstall app before installing it
    
    Tests can fail because there is leftover data from a previous run.
    For example:
    
    --- FAIL: TestRemoveAll (0.00s)
            path_test.go:96: RemoveAll "/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/66247524-5ED7-45A4-82AA-6BF15D6078B2/tmp//_TestRemoveAll_" (first): open /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/66247524-5ED7-45A4-82AA-6BF15D6078B2/tmp//_TestRemoveAll_/dir: permission denied
    FAIL
    FAIL    os      31.275s
    
    There seem to be no way to simply clear the app data for an app
    short of uninstalling it, so do that.
    
    This change in effect undoes CL 106676, which means that running iOS
    is a little slower again, and that another app from the same
    apple developer account must be present on the device for our app
    install to succeed.
