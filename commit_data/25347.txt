    net/http: document ResponseWriter and Handler more; add test
    
    Update docs on ResponseWriter and Handler around concurrency.
    
    Also add a test.
    
    The Handler docs were old and used "object" a lot. It was also too
    ServeMux-centric.
    
    Fixes #13050
    Updates #13659 (new issue found in http2 while writing the test)
