    cmd/asm: fix some fuzz bugs
    
    One (12466) was an actual logic error, backing up when there was
    nothing there. The others were due to continuing to process an
    instruction when it cannot work.
    
    Methodically stop assembling an instruction when it's not going to
    succeed.
    
    Fixes #12466.
    Fixes #12467.
    Fixes #12468.
