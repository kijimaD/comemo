    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: simplify fmtmap
    
    The format map is going to keep growing as we add more use of
    concrete node types. Stop that by reporting all Node implementations
    as Node.
    
    Also, there's little point to reporting uses of %v, %p, %T, nor to reporting
    formatting of basic types like int and []byte. Remove those too.
    (Vet takes care of mistakes involving basic types now.)
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
