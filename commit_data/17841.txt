    cmd/cgo: stop using -fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types
    
    This flag was added in January 2010, in CL 181102, to fix issue 497.
    (Numbers were just shorter back then.) The fix was for OS X machines
    and the llvm-gcc frontend.
    
    In July 2011 we had to change the way we get enum values, because
    there were no flags available to force Xcode's llvm-gcc to include the
    enum names and values in DWARF debug output.
    
    We now use clang, not llvm-gcc, on OS X machines.
    Earlier versions of clang printed a warning about not knowing the flag.
    Newer versions of clang now make that an error.
    
    That is:
     - The flag was added for OS X machines.
     - The flag is no longer necessary on OS X machines.
     - The flag now breaks some OS X machines.
    
    Remove it.
    
    I have run the original program from issue 497 successfully
    without the flag on both OS X and Linux machines.
    
    Fixes #6678.
