    cmd/compile: lay out exit blocks last
    
    In Go 1.8.x, panics are generally scheduled at the very end of functions.
    That property was lost in Go 1.9; this CL restores it.
    
    This helps with the Fannkuch benchmark:
    
    name          old time/op  new time/op  delta
    Fannkuch11-8   2.74s ± 2%   2.55s ± 2%  -7.03%  (p=0.000 n=20+20)
    
    This increases the fannkuch function size from 801 bytes to 831 bytes,
    but that is still smaller than Go 1.8.1 at 844 bytes.
    
    It generally increases binary size a tiny amount.
    Negligible compiler performance impact.
    
    For the code in #14758:
    
    name   old time/op    new time/op    delta
    Foo-8     326ns ± 3%     312ns ± 3%  -4.32%  (p=0.000 n=28+30)
    Bar-8     560ns ± 2%     565ns ± 2%  +0.96%  (p=0.002 n=30+27)
