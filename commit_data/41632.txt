    time: change genzabbrs.go to fetch windowsZones.xml file from GitHub
    
    It seems that windowsZones.xml file has moved to Github. I opened
    
    http://unicode.org/cldr/data/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml
    
    in my browser, and it redirected me to
    
    https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml
    
    Very nice of them.
    
    And we could see windowsZones.xml change history now. We could even
    probably file issues against this file, if we find problems.
    
    Anyway, this CL adjusts genzabbrs.go to use new GitHub location.
    
    I also run 'go generate' command with updated genzabbrs.go to update
    zoneinfo_abbrs_windows.go.
    
    Fixes #34917
