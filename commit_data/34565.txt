    math/big: avoid unnecessary Newton iteration in Float.Sqrt
    
    An initial draft of the Newton code for Float.Sqrt was structured like
    this:
    
      for condition
        // do Newton iteration..
        prec *= 2
    
    since prec, at the end of the loop, was double the precision used in
    the last Newton iteration, the termination condition was set to
    2*limit. The code was later rewritten in the form
    
      for condition
        prec *= 2
        // do Newton iteration..
    
    but condition was not updated, and it's still 2*limit, which is about
    double what we actually need, and is triggering the execution of an
    additional, and unnecessary, Newton iteration.
    
    This change adjusts the Newton termination condition to the (correct)
    value of z.prec, plus 32 guard bits as a safety margin.
