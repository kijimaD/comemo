    http: add MaxBytesReader to limit request body size
    
    This adds http.MaxBytesReader, similar to io.LimitReader,
    but specific to http, and for preventing a class of DoS
    attacks.
    
    This also makes the 10MB ParseForm limit optional (if
    not already set by a MaxBytesReader), documents it,
    and also adds "PUT" as a valid verb for parsing forms
    in the request body.
    
    Improves issue 2093 (DoS protection)
    Fixes #2165 (PUT form parsing)
