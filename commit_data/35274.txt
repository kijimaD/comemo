    cmd/vet: **T is not Stringer if *T has a String method
    
    vet recorded what types had String methods defined on them, but it did
    not record whether the receivers were pointer types. That information is
    important, as the following program is valid:
    
            type T string
    
            func (t *T) String() string {
                    return fmt.Sprint(&t) // prints address
            }
    
    Teach vet that, if *T is Stringer, **T is not.
    
    Fixes #23550.
