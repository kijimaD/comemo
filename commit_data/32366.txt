    time: add leap year test for Date
    
    I'm writing a matching implementation of the time package and missed
    the "add one day in a leap year" block. This test would have caught my
    error.
    
    I understand we can't add test cases for every Date but it seems like
    "tripped up someone attempting to reimplement this" is a good
    indicator it may trip up people in the future.
