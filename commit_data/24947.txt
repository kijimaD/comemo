commit 8b96be15f6632b33c7341840002bc5b0744b2977
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 31 15:45:47 2015 -0700

    time: allow any one- or two-digit day of the month when parsing.
    
    In Parse, one can now say Feb 31 or even Feb 99. This is easy
    to explain, consistent with time.Date, and even maybe useful.
    
    Fixes #12333.
    Fixes #7268. (By disagreeing with it.)
