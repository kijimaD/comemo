    runtime: clean up windows a bit
    
    Document the various hard-coded architecture checks
    or remove them in favor of more general checks.
    This should be a no-op now but will make the arm64 port
    have fewer diffs.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
