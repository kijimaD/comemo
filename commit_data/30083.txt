    net: handle "dns failure" as errNoSuchHost on Plan 9
    
    CL 31468 added TestLookupNonLDH, which was failing on Plan 9,
    because LookupHost was expecting to return errNoSuchHost
    on DNS resolution failure, while Plan 9 returned the
    "dns failure" string.
    
    In the Plan 9 implementation of lookupHost, we now return
    errNoSuchHost instead of the "dns failure" string, so
    the behavior is more consistant with other operating systems.
    
    Fixes #17568.
