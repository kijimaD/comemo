    runtime: restore old mp.fastrand initialization
    
    CL 337350 changed mp.fastrand from a [2]uint32 to a uint64 and changed
    the initialization to a single call of int64Hash. However, int64Hash
    returns uintptr, so 32-bit systems this always left the most
    significant 32 bits of mp.fastrand initialized to 0. The new code also
    did not protect against initializing mp.fastrand to 0, which on a
    system that does not implement math.Mul64 (most 32-bit systems) would
    lead fastrand to always return 0.
    
    This CL restores the mp.fastrand initialization to what it was before
    CL 337350, adjusted for the change from [2]uint32 to uint64.
