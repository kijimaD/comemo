    runtime/pprof: increment fake overflow record PC
    
    gentraceback generates PCs which are usually following the CALL
    instruction. For those that aren't, it fixes up the PCs so that
    functions processing the output can unconditionally decrement the PC.
    
    runtime_expandInlineFrames does this unconditional decrement when
    looking up the function. However, the fake stack frame generated for
    overflow records fails to meet the contract, and decrementing the PC
    results in a PC in the previous function. If that function contains
    inlined call, runtime_expandInlineFrames will not short-circuit and will
    panic trying to look up a PC that doesn't exist.
    
    Note that the added test does not fail at HEAD. It will only fail (with
    a panic) if the function preceeding lostProfileEvent contains inlined
    function calls. At the moment (on linux/amd64), that is
    runtime/pprof.addMaxRSS, which does not.
    
    Fixes #38096
