    README.vendor: add note about GOROOT, recommend fresh go
    
    Using a different build of Go (specifically, a different GOROOT) to
    maintain the vendor directory doesn't always reproduce the same results.
    This can result in unknowingly creating a vendor directory that isn't
    able to build Go.
    
    Add a note to README.vendor to point this out. Specifically, mention
    that a mismatched GOROOT is an issue, and recommend using a fresh build
    of Go to maintain the vendor directory.
    
    Updates #69235
