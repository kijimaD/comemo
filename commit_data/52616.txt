    cmd/go: don't assume decimal in test_fuzz_mutate_crash
    
    In the float test in test_fuzz_mutate_crash, don't assume the mutator
    will generate a decimal during mutation. The probability it will is
    quite high, but it is not guaranteed, which can cause a flake. Since we
    are not really testing that the mutator will do this kind of mutation,
    just that a mutation happens, just check that the input is not the zero
    value like the rest of the targets.
    
    Fixes #52852
