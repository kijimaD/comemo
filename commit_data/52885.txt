    runtime: use pidleget for faketime jump
    
    In faketime mode, checkdead is responsible for jumping time forward to
    the next timer expiration, and waking an M to handle the newly ready
    timer.
    
    Currently it pulls the exact P that owns the next timer off of the pidle
    list. In theory this is efficient because that P is immediately eligible
    to run the timer without stealing. Unfortunately it is also fraught with
    peril because we are skipping all of the bookkeeping in pidleget:
    
    * Skipped updates to timerpMask mean that our timers may not be eligible
      for stealing, as they should be.
    * Skipped updates to idlepMask mean that our runq may not be eligible
      for stealing, as they should be.
    * Skipped updates to sched.npidle may break tracking of spinning Ms,
      potentially resulting in lost work.
    * Finally, as of CL 410122, skipped updates to p.limiterEvent may affect
      the GC limiter, or cause a fatal throw when another event occurs.
    
    The last case has finally undercovered this issue since it quickly
    results in a hard crash.
    
    We could add all of these updates into checkdead, but it is much more
    maintainable to keep this logic in one place and use pidleget here like
    everywhere else in the runtime. This means we probably won't wake the
    P owning the timer, meaning that the P will need to steal the timer,
    which is less efficient, but faketime is not a performance-sensitive
    build mode. Note that the M will automatically make itself a spinning M
    to make it eligible to steal since it is the only one running.
    
    Fixes #53294
    For #52890
