    cmd/go: allow ~ in middle of path, just not at beginning
    
    An earlier CL disallowed ~ anywhere in GOPATH, to avoid
    problems with GOPATH='~/home' instead of GOPATH=~/home.
    But ~ is only special in the shell at the beginning of each of
    the paths in the list, and some paths do have ~ in the middle.
    So relax the requirement slightly.
    
    Fixes #4140.
