    build: run cgo tests with -pie if the external linker supports it.
    
    PIE binaries can be built by the Go compiler in external link mode with
    extldflags="-pie". These binaries support ASLR (address space layout
    randomization) when executed on systems with appropriate kernel/dynamic
    linker support.
    
    This CL enables some cgo tests to run with -pie as a sanity check (in
    addition to the other linker flag combinations they already test).
    
    I have tested this functionality more thoroughly by building the full
    compiler testsuite (test/...) and standard library tests with -pie
    and executing them remotely on ChromeOS devices for all three linux
    architectures (linux_amd64, linux_386, and linux_arm).
