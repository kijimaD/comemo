    net/http: document that Handlers shouldn't mutate Request
    
    Also, don't read from the Request.Headers in the http Server code once
    ServeHTTP has started. This is partially redundant with documenting
    that handlers shouldn't mutate request, but: the space is free due to
    bool packing, it's faster to do the checks once instead of N times in
    writeChunk, and it's a little nicer to code which previously didn't
    play by the unwritten rules. But I'm not going to fix all the cases.
    
    Fixes #14940
