    hash: update documentation for MakeTable in crc32 and crc64
    
    Explicitly say that *Table returned by MakeTable may not be
    modified. Otherwise, this leads to very subtle bugs that may
    or may not manifest themselves.
    
    Same comment was made on package crc64, to keep the future
    open to the caching tables that crc32 effectively does.
    
    Fixes: #12487.
