commit 103c9db74737afc67c394e3c68c746ba176f2b49

    spec: clarifications around exports, uniqueness of identifiers
    
    - Define what it means for two identifiers to be unique.
    
    - The current spec is incorrect about exported
    identifiers: for instance, it excluded fields
    of non-exported types of exported variables
    from being exported. It is easier to leave
    the detailed specification away and let the
    rest of the spec govern access of exported
    identifiers.
    
    - The current spec is incorrect about qualified
    identifiers: It simply required that an identifier
    be exported to be valid in a qualified identifier.
    However, qualified identifiers can only access
    exported identifiers declared in the package
    block of the imported package.
    
    Fixes #1551.
