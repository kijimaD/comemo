    runtime: make TestDebugLogInterleaving much more robust
    
    The current test often doesn't actually generate enough interleaving
    to result in multiple log shards. This CL rewrites this test to
    forcibly create at least 10 log shards with interleaved log messages.
    It also tests dlog's robustness to being held across M and P switches.
