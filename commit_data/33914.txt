    spec: state which predeclared types are defined or alias types (clarification)
    
    When we introduced the distinction between "defined" and "alias" types
    we retained the notion of a "named" type (any type with a name). The
    predeclared types (which all have names) simply remained named types.
    
    This CL clarifies the spec by stating excplicitly which predeclared
    types are defined types (or at least "act" like defined types), and
    which ones are alias types.
    
    Fixes #21785.
