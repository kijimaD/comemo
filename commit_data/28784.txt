    runtime: add explicit `INT $3` at end of Darwin amd64 sigtramp
    
    The omission of this instruction could confuse the traceback code if a
    SIGPROF occurred during a signal handler.  The traceback code would
    trace up to sigtramp, but would then get confused because it would see a
    PC address that did not appear to be in the function.
    
    Fixes #16453.
