    cc: change cas to newcase
    
    Change the name of cas() in cc to newcase() to avoid a NIX conflict.
    cas() is used in cc to create a new Case struct. There is a name
    conflict in that cas() is a commonly-used
    name for compare and swap. Since cas() is only used internally
    in the compiler in 3 places, change the name to avoid a wider
    conflict with the NIX runtime. This issue might well come up on
    other OSes in the future anyway, as the name is fairly common.
