    cmd/compile: get gcflags to bootstrap; ssa debug opts for "all"
    
    This is intended to help debug compiler problems that pop
    up in the bootstrap phase of make.bash.  GO_GCFLAGS does not
    normally apply there.  Options-for-all phases is intended
    to allow crude tracing (and full timing) by turning on timing
    for all phases, not just one.
    
    Phase names can also be specified using a regular expression,
    for example
    BOOT_GO_GCFLAGS=-d='ssa/~^.*scc$/off' \
    GO_GCFLAGS='-d=ssa/~^.*scc$/off' ./make.bash
    
    I just added this because it was the fastest way to get
    me to a place where I could easily debug the compiler.
