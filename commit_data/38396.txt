    cmd/compile: fix Mul->Mul64 intrinsic alias
    
    The alias declaration needs to come after the function it is aliasing.
    
    It isn't a big deal in this case, as bits.Mul inlines and has as its
    body bits.Mul64, so the desired code gets generated regardless.
    The alias should only have an effect on inlining cost estimates
    (for functions that call bits.Mul).
