commit 7141d1e6d820241de321f8a9d336871737560950
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Sun Jul 23 05:21:31 2023 -0400

    make.bash,bat,rc: use Go 1.20.6 instead of Go 1.17.13
    
    This was missed in the update of the bootstrap toolchain
    and should help people who don't set GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP
    and instead assume these scripts will find the right one.
    
    For #54265.
