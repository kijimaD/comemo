    csv: fix issue 2366 - overly aggressive TrimLeadingSpace
    
    Address the issue coalescing two records together when TrimLeadingSpace
    is set to true.
    
    The input
    
            a,b,
            c,d,e
    
    Would result with a singled a,b,c,d,e record.
    With TrailingComma set to true it should give two records.
    With TrailingComma set to false it should be an error.
    
    Fixes #2366.
