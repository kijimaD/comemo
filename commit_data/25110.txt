    net/http: enable HTTP/2 on all Transports, not just the DefaultTransport
    
    This mirrors the same behavior and API from the server code to the
    client side: if TLSNextProto is nil, HTTP/2 is on by default for
    both. If it's non-nil, the user was trying to do something fancy and
    step out of their way.
    
    Updates #6891
