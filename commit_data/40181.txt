    cmd/dist: handle arm64 as a machine hardware name
    
    OpenBSD/arm64 reports itself as arm64 from `uname -m` - this currently
    matches as gohostarch=arm, rather than gohostarch=arm64. Correct this
    by matching on both aarch64 and arm64 (the alternative would be to use
    `uname -p`, however that's likely to cause upset elsewhere).
    
    Updates #31656
