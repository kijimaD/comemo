    unicode/utf8: optimize ValidRune
    
    Re-writing the switch statement as a single boolean expression
    reduces the number of branches that the compiler generates.
    It is also arguably easier to read as a pair of numeric ranges
    that valid runes can exist in.
    
    No test changes since the existing test does a good job of
    testing all of the boundaries.
    
    This change was to gain back some performance after a correctness
    fix done in http://golang.org/cl/32123.
    
    The correctness fix (CL/32123) slowed down the benchmarks slightly:
            benchmark                   old ns/op     new ns/op     delta
            BenchmarkIndexRune/10-4     19.3          21.6          +11.92%
            BenchmarkIndexRune/32-4     33.6          35.2          +4.76%
    
    Since the fix relies on utf8.ValidRune, this CL improves benchmarks:
            benchmark                   old ns/op     new ns/op     delta
            BenchmarkIndexRune/10-4     21.6          20.0          -7.41%
            BenchmarkIndexRune/32-4     35.2          33.5          -4.83%
