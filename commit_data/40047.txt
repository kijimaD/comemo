    cmd/compile: in prove, learn facts from OpSliceMake
    
    Now that OpSliceMake is called by runtime.makeslice callers,
    prove can see and record the actual length and cap of each
    slice being constructed.
    
    This small patch is enough to remove 260 additional bound checks
    from cmd+std.
    
    Thanks to Martin MÃ¶hrmann for pointing me to CL141822 that
    I had missed.
