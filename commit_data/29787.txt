    cmd/compile: remove some write barriers for stack writes
    
    This, along with CL 30140, removes ~50% of stack write barriers
    mentioned in issue #17330. The remaining are most due to Phi and
    FwdRef, which is not resolved when building SSA. We might be
    able to do it at a later stage where Phi and Copy propagations
    are done, but matching an if-(store-store-call)+ sequence seems
    not very pleasant.
    
    Updates #17330.
