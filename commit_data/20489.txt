    runtime: rename SchedType to SchedT
    
    CL 144940043 renamed it from Sched to SchedType
    to avoid a lowercasing conflict in the Go code with
    the variable named sched.
    We've been using just T resolve those conflicts, not Type.
    
    The FooType pattern is already taken for the kind-specific
    variants of the runtime Type structure: ChanType, MapType,
    and so on. SchedType isn't a Type.
