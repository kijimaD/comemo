    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz,testing: treat panics as recoverable
    
    And only log the last panic, not all of them, during minimization.
    This change makes the worker processes quiet, so now the only
    process that logs anything is the coordinator. This hides all of
    the panics caused during minimization of an input which causes
    a panic.
    
    This change also alters the usage of tRunner such that we now
    recover from recoverable panics instead of terminating the
    process. This results in larger stack traces, since we include
    a bit more of the trace within testing. There is a TODO to see
    if it's possible to slice the stack up so that it is somewhat
    more informative.
