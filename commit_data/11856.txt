commit 1f2445d27bfca7d44f90ed9a6dbb799289bdf548

    gc: delete old unsafe functions
    
    Also update build to be able to run mkbuiltin again.
    The export form has changed a little, so builtin.c has
    more diffs than unsafe.go.
    
    In CL 5650069, I just edited the documentation, a rarely
    successful method of change.
