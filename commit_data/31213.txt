    spec: pick up a few corrections missed in prior commit
    
    This CL picks up a couple of minor fixes that were present
    in https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/36213/6..5 but
    accidentally got dropped in https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/36213/
    because I submitted from the wrong client.
