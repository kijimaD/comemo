    cmd/compile: teach dse about equivalent LocalAddrs
    
    This patch teaches DSE that two LocalAddrs of the same variable
    are equal, even if they are from different memory states. This avoids
    dependance on a store into the same LocalAddr being added to
    loadUse even though the store is unnecessary and is in fact
    shadowed.
    
    Fixes #59021
