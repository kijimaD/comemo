    testing: parallelize tests over count
    
    Currently all package tests are executed once
    with Parallel tests executed in parallel.
    Then this process is repeated count*cpu times.
    Tests are not parallelized over count*cpu.
    Parallelizing over cpu is not possible as
    GOMAXPROCS is a global setting. But it is
    possible for count.
    
    Parallelize over count.
    
    Brings down testing of my package with -count=100
    form 10s to 0.3s.
