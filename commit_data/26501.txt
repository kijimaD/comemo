    misc/cgo/testcarchive: fix build
    
    I failed to rebase (and re-test) CL 21102 before submit, which meant
    that two extra tests sneaked into testcarchive that still referenced
    runtime.GOOS and runtime.GOARCH.
    
    Convert the new tests.
    
    While we're here, make sure pending tasks are flushed before running
    the host tests. If not, the "##### misc/cgo/testcarchive" banner
    and "PASS" won't show up in the all.bash output.
