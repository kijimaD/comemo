commit 58b86e50138adaed962ad12a55ede7fb8b0886d9

    liblink, cmd/gc, cmd/{5,6,8}{a,c}: rename linkwriteobj to writeobj
    
    The name linkwriteobj is misleading because it implies that
    the function has something to do with the linker, which it
    does not.  The name is historical: the function performs an
    operation that was previously performed by the linker, but no
    longer is.
