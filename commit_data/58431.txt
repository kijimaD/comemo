    runtime: clarify error when returning unpinned pointers
    
    With the introduction of runtime.Pinner, returning a pointer to a pinned
    struct that then points to an unpinned Go pointer is correctly caught.
    
    However, the error message remained as "cgo result has Go pointer",
    which should be updated to acknowledge that Go pointers to pinned
    memory are allowed.
    
    This also updates the comments for cgoCheckArg and cgoCheckResult
    to similarly clarify.
    
    Updates #46787
