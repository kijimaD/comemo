    crypto/tls: fix test data generation
    
    - Multiple GetCertificate tests shared the same name and were
      overwriting each other, each test now has a unique name.
    - expectAlert was not implemented in the data updater, the single
      test that used it has been replaced with a ClientHello failure
      test.
    
    Fixes #10470
