    cmd/cgo/internal/testsanitizers: check for go build and cgo in fuzzer and msan tests
    
    Make sure the platform we are running the tests on can compile programs
    and has cgo support in order to run the fuzzer and msan tests. This is the
    same approach used by the asan tests, which share the same requirements.
    
    Fixes #64626
