    readme: emphasize issue tracker is for bugs/proposals
    
    Removed direct link to issue tracker in the README - it makes it too
    easy to use it for a question - and it's abused multiple times a day
    for questions. It's easy enough to find it if there's a real issue
    to report.
    
    Added sentence to point people at golang-nuts and the new forum.
