    src/buildall.bash: remove mobile filter
    
    Mobile targets are not supported by misc-compile trybots, as tracked in
    golang.org/issue/25963, and need to be filtered out. The buildall.bash
    script was created in CL 9438, back when it was a single all-compile
    builder, and it was easier to filter out mobile targets in the script
    than to come up with a pattern that matches all non-mobile targets.
    
    As of CL 254740, all mobile targets (Android and iOS) have unique GOOS
    values. That makes it it easy to filter them out in x/build/dashboard.
    This was done in CL 258057. As a result, it's now viable to simplify
    this script and perform all misc-compile target selection in x/build,
    rather than having it spread it across two places.
    
    Also, as of CL 10750, the all-compile builder has turned into multiple
    misc-compile builders, so update the script description accordingly.
    
    Updates #41610.
