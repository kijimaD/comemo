    misc/ios,runtime/cgo: remove SIGINT handshake for the iOS exec wrapper
    
    Once upon a time, the iOS exec wrapper needed to change the current
    working directory for the binary being tested. To allow that, the
    runtime raised a SIGINT signal that the wrapper caught, changed the
    working directory and resumed the process.
    
    These days, the current working directory is passed from the wrapper
    to the runtime through a special entry in the app metadata and the
    SIGINT handshake is not necessary anymore.
    
    Remove the signaling from the runtime and the exec harness.
