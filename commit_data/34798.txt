    compress/gzip: do not count header bytes written in Write
    
    Before, if an underlying writer errored within 10 bytes (plus any gzip
    header metadata), a gzip.Write would erroneously report up to 10 bytes
    written that were not actually written of the input slice. This is
    especially problematic when the input slice is less than 10 bytes.
    
    The error came from counting the 10 header byte write. If writing the
    header is completely successful, the 10 bytes written is overridden by
    the flate write with the input slice.
    
    This removes counting the 10 required header bytes, and also changes the
    return to use zero until the slice is used.
    
    The old Write could return one byte written when it actually was not.
    This is difficult to verify because the smallest input slice is one
    byte; a test checking that the input slice was the byte written would be
    quite involved. Thankfully, gzip's minimum header write is 10 bytes. If
    we test that two bytes are not falsely written, we indirectly cover the
    one byte case.
    
    Fixes #24625
