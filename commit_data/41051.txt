    runtime: monitor for suspend/resume to kick timeouts
    
    Starting in Windows 8, the wait functions don't take into account
    suspend time, even though the monotonic counters do. This results in
    timer buckets stalling on resume. Therefore, this commit makes it so
    that on resume, we return from the wait functions and recalculate the
    amount of time left to wait.
    
    Fixes: #31528
