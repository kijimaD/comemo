    misc/{bbedit|IntelliJIDEA|kate}: add missing delete predeclared identifier
    
    In general the description should describe what is added or fixed,
    not how it was done (the code does this), but in this case the cause
    was delete was missing, so the fix is to add it.
    
    Fixes  issue 5765.
