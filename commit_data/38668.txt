    cmd/vet: rewrite method check to use go/types
    
    Now that vet can rely on go/types, there's no reason to do extra work to
    avoid using it. The rewrite lets us get rid of the field list flattening
    code, as well as the slight verbosity that comes with go/printer.
    
    While at it, make the testdata/method.go expected errors be more
    specific, to make sure that we're not breaking the warnings that are
    printed.
    
    Finally, update whitelist/all.txt, since the reported errors now include
    qualified types.
