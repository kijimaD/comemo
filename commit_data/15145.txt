    exp/inotify: close event channel before file descriptor
    
    Closing the inotify file descriptor can take over a second
    when running on Ubuntu Precise in an NFS directory, leading to
    the test error in issue 3132.  Closing the event channel first
    lets a client that does not care about the error channel move
    on.
    
    Fixes #3132.
