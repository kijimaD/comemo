    cmd/compile: omit file:pos for non-existent errors
    
    Omits printing the file:line:column when trying to
    open non-existent files
    
    Given:
        go tool compile x.go
    
    * Before:
        x.go:0: open x.go: no such file or directory
    
    * After:
        open x.go: no such file or directory
    
    Reverts the revert in CL 231043 by only fixing the case
    of non-existent errors which is what the original bug
    was about. The fix for "permission errors" will come later
    on when I have bandwidth to investigate the differences
    between running with root and why os.Open works for some
    builders and not others.
    
    Fixes #36437
