    [dev.garbage] runtime: Linear map test give false negative due to GC.
    This test gives a false negative at an observed rate of 1 in a 1000
    due to the fact that it runs for < 100 ms. allowing GC pauses to
    warp the results. Changed the test so that it triggers only if it
    remains non-linear for much larger problem sizes.
