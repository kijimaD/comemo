    Revert "os: set TMPDIR on darwin/arm"
    
    This reverts commit 87a0d395c3d454c6efa560c406b5b3d8ad71c8f6.
    
    Looks like introducing file_darwin_arm.go is confusing something in the API checker (probably go/types) into ignoring file.go, so the O_SYNC symbol is being lost.
    
    No actual bug in this CL AFAIK, but I'll fix the other bug later and then roll this forward.
