    testing: add argument to list tests, benchmarks, and examples
    
    Some large testing/build systems require some form of test discovery before
    running tests.  This usually allows for analytics, history, and stats on a per
    tests basis.  Typically these systems are meant used in multi-language
    environments and the original source code is not known or available.
    
    This adds a -test.list option which takes a regular expression as an
    argument. Any tests, benchmarks, or examples that match that regular
    expression will be printed, one per line, to stdout and then the program
    will exit.
    
    Since subtests are named/discovered at run time this will only show
    top-level tests names and is a known limitation.
    
    Fixes #17209
