    cmd/gc: don't copy []byte during string comparison
    
    Currently we allocate a new string during []byte->string conversion
    in string comparison expressions. String allocation is unnecessary in
    this case, because comparison does memorize the strings for later use.
    This change uses slicebytetostringtmp to construct temp string directly
    from []byte buffer and passes it to runtime.eqstring.
