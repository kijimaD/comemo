    cmd/go: fix modload infinite directory loop
    
    It is possible to enter the parent-walking directory loop in a way that
    it will loop forever - if mdir is empty, and d reaches ".". To avoid
    this, make sure that the 'd = filepath.Dir(d)' step only happens if the
    parent directory is actually different than the current directory.
    
    This fixes some of the tests like TestImport/golang.org_x_net_context,
    which were never finishing before.
    
    While at it, also fix TestImport/golang.org_x_net, which seems to have
    the wrong expected error. The root of the x/net repo doesn't have a
    go.mod file, nor is part of a module itself, so it seems like the
    expected error should reflect that.
    
    After these two changes, 'go test cmd/go/internal/modload' passes on my
    linux/amd64 machine.
    
    Fixes #27080.
