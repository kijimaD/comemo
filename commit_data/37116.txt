    strings: add note for new Go developers to TrimLeft and TrimRight
    
    If one quickly looks at the strings package godoc, reading the name
    TrimLeft, one might think it removes a prefix from the string.
    
    The function's godoc does explain its purpose, but it's apparent that it
    is not clear enough, as there have been numerous raised issues about
    this confusion: #12771 #14657 #18160 #19371 #20085 #25328 #26119. These
    questions are also frequent elsewhere on the internet.
    
    Add a very short paragraph to the godoc, to hopefully point new Go
    developers in the right direction faster. Do the same thing for
    TrimRight and TrimSuffix.
