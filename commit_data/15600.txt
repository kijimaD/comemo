    misc/emacs: Add compatibility for GNU Emacs 23 and XEmacs >=21.5.32
    
    This CL adds compatibility for GNU Emacs 23 (fixing fontification
    issues) and XEmacs >=21.5.32 (fixing a lot of issues). Earlier
    versions of XEmacs will not be supported because they do not
    support POSIX character classes. Because of that, we also make use
    of a lot of functions that were added in 21.5.32.
    
    A known and currently unfixable issue with XEmacs is that go-mode
    will not always fontify identifiers that use unicode correctly.
    
    All changes for XEmacs are annotated in the diff.
    
    Note: go--position-bytes is not currently used anywhere, but will
    be in a future CL.
    
    Fixes #4927.
