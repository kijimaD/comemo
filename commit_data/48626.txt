    net: skip tests that use netsh on the windows-arm64-10 builder
    
    These tests sometimes hang on Windows 10 on ARM64, due to what appears
    to be a platform bug. Since we have not yet observed any such hangs on
    the windows-arm64-11 builder, I am leaving the tests otherwise enabled
    on the theory that the platform bug may have been fixed in Windows 11.
    
    Fixes #52082 (at least for now).
