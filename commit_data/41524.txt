    syscall: fix Fchdir on js/wasm
    
    NodeJS does not support fchdir so it has to be emulated with chdir by
    saving the path when opening a directory.
    
    However, if the path opened is relative, saving this path is not
    sufficient, because after changing the working directory the path
    does not resolve correctly any more, thus a subsequent fd.Chdir() fails.
    
    This change fixes the issue by resolving a relative path when
    opening the directory and saving the absolute path instead.
    
    Fixes #37448
