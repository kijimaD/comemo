    go/scanner: clean up error interface
    
    Issue 2856 asks for a rename of a few methods to a
    more idiomatic Go style. This is a very early API
    that evolved organically throughout the years.
    Together with the fact that ErrorVectors were embedded
    in other data structures (e.g. Parser), just renaming
    methods (e.g. GetError -> Error) would lead to undesired
    behavior (e.g., Parser would act like an Error). Instead,
    cleaned up API a bit more:
    
    - removed ErrorVector in favor of ErrorList (already
    present)
    - simplified Scanner.Init by making the error handler a
    function instead of requiring an ErrorHandler implementation
    - adjusted helper functions accordingly
    - updated Go 1 doc
    
    Fixes #2856.
