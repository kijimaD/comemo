commit 6d888f1e1b81bd2545e5da710d37a5a0ddce71d5

    build: clang support
    
    This works with at least one version of clang
    that existed at one moment in time.
    No guarantees about clangs past or future.
    
    To try:
            CC=clang all.bash
    
    It does not work with the Xcode clang,
    because that clang fails at printing a useful answer
    to:
            clang -print-libgcc-file-name
    The clang that works prints a full path name for
    that command, not just "libgcc.a".
    
    Fixes #4713.
