commit 11a218444f59567c9c65300045dccddef60e193a

    Revert previous change: complexN only converts to complexN.
    
    This was discussed with Ken and Russ.  6g has been changed,
    and both compilers now work this way.  This avoids a double
    type conversion--first to the float type, then to the complex
    type.
