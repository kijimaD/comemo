commit 0bcf8bcd998a79f2479c2bb7096eb57a38ffee85
Author: Giovanni Bajo <rasky@develer.com>

    test: in asmcheck, regexp must match from beginning of line
    
    This avoid simple bugs like "ADD" matching "FADD". Obviously
    "ADD" will still match "ADDQ" so some care is still required
    in this regard, but at least a first class of possible errors
    is taken care of.
