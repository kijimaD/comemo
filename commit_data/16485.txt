    cmd/ld: fix gcdata and gcbss symbols
    
    These two symbols don't show up in the Go symbol table
    since they're defined in dodata which is called sometime
    after symtab. They do, however, show up in the ELF symbol
    table.
    
    This regression was introduced in changeset 01c40d533367.
    
    Also, remove the corresponding strings from the ELF strtab
    section now that they're unused.
