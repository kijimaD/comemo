    cmd/compile/internal/ssa/gen: add comment on SB-addressing on s390x
    
    During the review of CL 38801 it was noted that it would be nice
    to have a bit more clarity on how-and-why SB addressing is handled
    strangely on s390x. This additional comment should hopefully help.
    
    In general SB is handled differently because not all instructions
    have variants that use relative addressing.
