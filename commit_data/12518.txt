    cmd/go: rebuild external test package dependencies
    
    Was missing recompilation of packages imported only
    by external test packages (package foo_test), primarily
    because Root was not set, so those packages looked like
    they were from a different Go tree, so they were not
    recompiled if they already existed.
    
    Also clean things up so that only one call to computeStale
    is needed.
    
    Fixes #3238.
