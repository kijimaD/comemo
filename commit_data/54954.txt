    cmd/compile: reenable inlstaticinit
    
    This was disabled in CL 452676 out of an abundance of caution,
    but further analysis has shown that the failures were not being
    caused by this optimization. Instead the sequence of commits was:
    
    CL 450136 cmd/compile: handle simple inlined calls in staticinit
    ...
    CL 449937 archive/tar, archive/zip: return ErrInsecurePath for unsafe paths
    ...
    CL 451555 cmd/compile: fix static init for inlined calls
    
    The failures in question became compile failures in the first CL
    and started building again after the last CL.
    But in the interim the code had been broken by the middle CL.
    CL 451555 was just the first time that the tests could run and fail.
    
    For #30820.
