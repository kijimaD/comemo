    runtime: simplify forced GC triggering
    
    Now that the gcMode is no longer involved in the GC trigger condition,
    we can simplify the triggering of forced GCs. By making the trigger
    condition for forced GCs true even if gcphase is not _GCoff, we don't
    need any special case path in gcStart to ensure that forced GCs don't
    get consolidated.
