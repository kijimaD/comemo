    cmd/go: add positions for load errors in call to load
    
    This CL sets positions for errors from cals to load within the load
    call itself, similar to how the rest of the code in pkg.go sets
    positions right after the error is set on the package.
    
    This allows the code to ensure that we only add positions either for
    ImportPathErrors, or if an error was passed into load, and was set
    using setLoadPackageDataError. (Though I'm wondering if the call
    to setLoadPackageDataError should be done before the call to load).
    
    Fixes #38034
