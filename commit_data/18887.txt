    build: fix race in doc/articles/wiki test
    
    The original test would open a local port and then immediately close it
    and use the port number in subsequent tests. Between the port being closed
    and reused by the later process, it could be opened by some other program
    on the machine.
    
    Changed the test to run the server process directly and have it save the
    assigned port to a text file to be used by client processes.
    
    Fixes #5564.
