    go/types: simplify method set computation
    
    After fixing #37081 we don't need to explicitly keep track of
    field collisions in the method set computation anymore; we only
    need to know which field (names) exists at each embedding level.
    Simplify the code by removing the dedicated fieldSet data type
    in favor of a simple string set.
    
    Follow-up on https://golang.org/cl/218617; separate CL to make it
    easier to identify a problem with these two changes, should there
    be one.
    
    Updates #37081.
