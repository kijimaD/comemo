    cmd/dist: refactor rtPreFunc to print skips in only one place
    
    Currently, all uses of rtPreFunc are to print a message and skip a
    test. When we move to JSON, the logic to just "print a message" is
    going to be more complicated, so refactor this so the function returns
    the skip message and we print it in just one place. We also rename the
    option to rtSkipFunc to better represent what we use it for.
    
    For #37486.
