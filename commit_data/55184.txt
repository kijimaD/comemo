    net: delete TestTCPSelfConnect
    
    This test is flaky, apparently due to a typo'd operator in CL 21447
    that causes it to compare “same port OR IP” instead of
    “same port AND IP”.
    
    If we merely fixed the comparison, the test would hopefully stop being
    flaky itself, but we would still be left with another problem:
    repeatedly dialing a port that we believe to be unused can interfere
    with other tests, which may open the previously-unused port and then
    attempt a single Dial and expect it to succeed. Arbitrary other Dial
    calls for that port may cause the wrong connection to be accepted,
    leading to spurious test failures.
    
    Moreover, the test can be extremely expensive for the amount of data
    we hope to get from it, depending on the system's port-reuse
    algorithms and dial implementations. It is already scaled back by up
    to 1000x on a huge number of platforms due to latency, and may even be
    ineffective on those platforms because of the arbitrary 1ms Dial
    timeout. And the incremental value from it is quite low, too: it tests
    the workaround for what is arguably a bug in the Linux kernel, which
    ought to be fixed (and tested) upstream instead of worked around in
    every open-source project that dials local ports.
    
    Instead of trying to deflake this test, let's just get rid of it.
    
    Fixes #18290.
