    cmd/compile: add column details to export data
    
    This CL updates the export data format to include column details when
    writing out position data. cmd/compile is updated to generate and make
    use of the new details, but go/internal/gcimporter only knows how to
    read the data. It doesn't yet actually make use of it.
    
    Experimentally across a wide range of packages, this increases export
    data size by around 4%. However, it has no impact on binary size.
    (Notably, it actually shrinks k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubelet's binary
    size by 24kB, but it's unclear to me why at this time.)
    
    Updates #28259.
