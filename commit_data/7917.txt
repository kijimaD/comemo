commit e393efc499b17d6dd13ebf558f57c3cb6a484595
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    ngotest: a new gotest command, written in Go.
    It runs all tests correctly and saves significant time by avoiding the shell script.
    However, this is just the code for the command, for review.
    A separate CL will move this into the real gotest, which will take some dancing.
