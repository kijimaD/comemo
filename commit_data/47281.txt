    runtime: fix a lock rank ordering and some edges.
    
    The first stack-trace in #49361 shows that traceBuf must precede fin in
    lockrank ordering, since traceBuf is acquired in StartTrace(), which
    eventually leads to getting fin in queueFinalizer(). It is fine to move
    traceBuf above fin, since there are no other conflicting dependencies.
    
    The second stack trace shows that there is an edge bewtween reflectOffs
    and fin, since reflectOffs is acquired in addReflectOff, and map
    operations can lead to an allocation that eventually causes fin to be
    acquired in queueFinalizer().
    
    Fixes #49361
