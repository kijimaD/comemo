    compress/bzip2: fix checksum mismatch on empty reads
    
    Previously, the read method checked whether the current block
    was fully consumed or not based on whether the buffer could be filled
    with a non-zero number of bytes. This check is problematic because
    zero bytes could be read if the provided buffer is empty.
    
    We fix this case by simply checking for whether the input buffer
    provided by the user was empty or not. If empty, we assume that
    we could not read any bytes because the buffer was too small,
    rather than indicating that the current block was fully exhausted.
    
    This check causes bzip2.Reader to be unable to make progress
    on the next block unless a non-empty buffer is provided.
    However, that is an entirely reasonable expectation since a
    non-empty buffer needs to be provided eventually anyways to
    read the actual contents of subsequent blocks.
    
    Fixes #22028
