    test: add regression test from #41474
    
    This issue was fixed with multiple individual compiler optimizations,
    each of which had their own respective test cases. This CL just adds
    the capstone test case to demonstrate that the issue has been fixed
    and doesn't regress again.
    
    Updates #41474.
