    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: add support for most system registers
    
    This patch supports the EL0 and EL1 system registers used in MRS/MSR
    instructions. This patch refactors the assembler code, allowing the
    assembler to read system register information from the automatically
    generated sysRegEnc.go file and move existing declared system registers
    to the sysRegEnc.go file.
    
    This patch adds 431 system registers, it is worth noting that the number
    of special registers is initialized to less than 1024 in the list7.go file.
    
    This CL also adds some test cases to test the newly added system registers.
    
    The test cases are contributed by Dianhong Xu <Dianhong.Xu@arm.com>
