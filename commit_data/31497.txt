    template: warn about interleaved nature of writes
    
    Execute incurs separate writes for each "step", e.g. each
    variable that needs to be printed, and the final newline.
    While it is correct to state that templates can be executed
    concurrently, there is a more subtle nuance that is easily missed:
    when writing to the same writer, the writes from concurrent execute
    calls can be interleaved, leading to unexpected output.
