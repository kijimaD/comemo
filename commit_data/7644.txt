    httptest: introduce TempServer, clean up tests
    
    This also breaks fs_test into two parts
    as the range tests test http's private httpRange
    and I had to change the fs_test package from
    "http" to "http_test" to use httptest which otherwise
    has a cyclic depedency back on http.
    
    Aside: we should start exposing the Range
    stuff in the future.
