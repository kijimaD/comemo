    runtime/race: ignore user GORACE env var in tests
    
    I did 'export GORACE=atexit_sleep_ms=0' in a console
    and then was puzzled as to why race tests fail.
    Existing GORACE env var may (or may not) override
    the one that we setup.
    Filter out GORACE as we do for other important env vars.
