    cmd/compile: fix TestAssembly on Plan 9
    
    Since CL 23620, TestAssembly is failing on Plan 9.
    
    In CL 23620, the process environment is passed to 'go tool compile'
    after setting GOARCH. On Plan 9, if GOARCH is already set in the
    process environment, it would take precedence. On Unix, it works
    as expected because the first GOARCH found takes precedence.
    
    This change uses the mergeEnvLists function from cmd/go/main.go
    to merge the two environment lists such that variables with the
    same name in "in" replace those in "out".
