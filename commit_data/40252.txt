    runtime: account for callbacks in checkdead on Windows
    
    When a callback runs on a different thread in Windows, as in the
    runtime package test TestCallbackInAnotherThread, it will use the
    extra M. That can cause the test in checkdead to fail incorrectly.
    Check whether there actually is an extra M before expecting it.
    
    I think this is a general problem unrelated to timers. I think the test
    was passing previously because the timer goroutine was using an M.
    But I haven't proved that. This change seems correct, and it avoids
    the test failure when using the new timers on Windows.
