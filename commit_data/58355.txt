    cmd/go: use AppendPath(OrigEnv) as env for tool executable
    
    Before this change, when go tool wass used to start a tool defined in a
    go.mod tool directive, it used the environment the go command was
    running in. The issue with doing that is that the go command sets
    various environment variables from the computed environment when
    invoking a subcommand. That is used to standardise the environment for
    the various tools invoked by the go command, but it is not the
    expectatation of tools invoked by the go command, especially since those
    environment variables may change the behavior of the tool run. Instead
    use the same environment we use in go run to start the executable: the
    original environment (with minor modifications) saved before we start
    explicitly setting the envornment, with GOROOT/bin added to the path so
    that sub commands that run the go tool use the proper go tool binary.
    
    Fixes #70544
