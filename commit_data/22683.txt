    runtime: use timer for GC control revise rather than timeout
    
    Currently, we use a note sleep with a timeout in a loop in func gc to
    periodically revise the GC control variables. Replace this with a
    fully blocking note sleep and use a periodic timer to trigger the
    revise instead. This is a step toward replacing the note sleep in func
    gc.
