    runtime: fix flaky TestBlockProfile test
    
    It has been failing periodically on Solaris/x64.
    Change blockevent so it always records an event if we called
    SetBlockProfileRate(1), even if the time delta is negative or zero.
    
    Hopefully this will fix the test on Solaris.
    Caveat: I don't actually know what the Solaris problem is, this
    is just an educated guess.
