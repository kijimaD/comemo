    net/http: normalize empty port in URL.Host's ":port"
    
    - Ensures that the empty port and preceeding ":"
    in a URL.Host are stripped.
    Normalize the empty port in a URL.Host's ":port" as
    mandated by RFC 3986 Section 6.2.3 which states that:
    `Likewise an explicit ":port", for which the port is empty or
    the default for the scheme, is equivalent to one where the port
    and its ":" delimiter are elided and thus should be
    removed by scheme-based normalization.`
    
    - Moves function `hasPort` from client.go (where it was defined but
    not used directly), to http.go the common area.
    
    Fixes #14836
