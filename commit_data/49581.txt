    cmd/go/internal/modload: use "pruned" instead of "lazy" to describe pruned module graphs
    
    The level of support for pruning — not the lazy/eager loading behavior
    — is the more fundamental property, and what matters in terms of what
    invariants we need to maintain.
    
    If the main module supports pruned module graphs we load its
    dependencies lazily, and if it does not support pruned module graphs
    we load its dependencies eagerly. However, in principle we could also
    load the module graph lazily even in modules that do not support graph
    pruning — we would just be more likely to overlook inconsistent
    requirements introduced by hand-edits or bad VCS merges to the go.mod
    file.
    
    (After this change, a “lazy” module is just one in which we happen not
    to have loaded the module graph, and an “eager” one is one in which we
    happen to load the module graph more aggressively.)
