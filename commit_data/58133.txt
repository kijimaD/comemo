    crypto/internal/nistec: use mixed addition in purego ScalarBaseMult
    
    The affine addition formula is significantly faster, and sets us up to
    reuse the precomputed table from the assembly implementation.
    
    This is an incremental step towards converging the purego and assembly
    implementations, with the goal of eventually merging them.
    
    Very proud of how the conditional AddAffine avoids the whole zero/sel
    cmov dance, compared to the same logic in the assembly implementation.
