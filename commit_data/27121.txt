    cmd/link: correctly decode name length
    
    The linker was incorrectly decoding type name lengths, causing
    typelinks to be sorted out of order and in cases where the name was
    the exact right length, linker panics.
    
    Added a test to the reflect package that causes TestTypelinksSorted
    to fail before this CL. It's not the exact failure seen in #15448
    but it has the same cause: decodetype_name calculating the wrong
    length.
    
    The equivalent decoders in reflect/type.go and runtime/type.go
    have the parenthesis in the right place.
    
    Fixes #15448
