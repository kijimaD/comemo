+Assembler:
+
+ARM assembly syntax has had some features removed.
+
+	- mentioning SP or PC as a hardware register
+		These are always pseudo-registers except that in some contexts
+		they're not, and it's confusing because the context should not affect
+		which register you mean. Change the references to the hardware
+		registers to be explicit: R13 for SP, R15 for PC.
+	- constant creation using assignment
+		The files say a=b when they could instead say #define a b.
+		There is no reason to have both mechanisms.
+	- R(0) to refer to R0.
+		Some macros use this to a great extent. Again, it's easy just to
+		use a #define to rename a register.
+	
+Also expression evaluation now uses uint64s instead of signed integers and the
+precedence of operators is now Go-like rather than C-like.
