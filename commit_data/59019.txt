    internal/buildcfg: enable DWARF version 5 by default
    
    This patch enables the DWARF version 5 experiment by default for most
    platforms that support DWARF. Note that MacOS is kept at version 4,
    due to problems with CGO builds; the "dsymutil" tool from older
    versions of Xcode (prior to V16) can't handle DWARF5. Similar we keep
    DWARF 4 for GOOS=aix, where XCOFF doesn't appear to support the new
    section subtypes in DWARF 5.
    
    Updates #26379.
