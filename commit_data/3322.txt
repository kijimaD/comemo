commit 4a4ec238707ac1a7fd83c322c3ab024464d81f20

    8l: step toward native client.
      - ELF header bits and addresses
      - do not let instructions span 32-byte boundary
      - align CALLs so return is to 32-byte boundary
      - align indirect jump targets to 32-byte boundary
        (only possible indirect jumps are function entries)
    
    still to do:
      - replace indirect jump, indirect call, and ret with
        nacl-approved instruction sequences
      - switch to GS segment for m-local storage
