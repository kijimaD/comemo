commit 903d28bd1e5b27dcbd68575d5952ffcbe8605296
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    ANY is already checked separately,
    so remove code from go.y.
    
    show original types in badtype; don't remove pointers.
    not sure why this was here but it confuses things
    if the bad part involves two named pointer types
    with different names but the same pointed-at type.
