    spec: better comment in example for type definition
    
    The old comment for the example
    
            type PtrMutex *Mutex
    
    talked about the method set of the base type of PtrMutex.
    It's more direct and clearer to talk about the underlying
    type of PtrMutex for this specific example.
    Also removed link inside pre-formatted region of text.
    
    Fixes #20900.
