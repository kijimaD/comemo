    builtin: add documentation for builtins
    Do this by adding a fake package called builtin. At the moment, godoc will
    not present this documentation because the function names are all lower case,
    but there are plans to address this.
    The print and println functions are undocumented here. I could be talked
    into doing them but I'd rather not promote their use.
