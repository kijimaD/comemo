    cmd/api: use api/next directory for beta versions
    
    Even though we don't issue beta pre-releases of Go at this time,
    it can still be useful to build them without publishing as part
    of testing the release infrastructure.
    
    For such versions, use the next directory content so that the
    API check doesn't produce a false positive during the earlier
    stages of the development cycle, before the next directory is
    merged into a combined and eventually frozen api file.
    
    For #29205.
