commit efda3aba10305754ddbf72ba85a7b6ff05c1c9d1
Author: Nigel Tao <nigeltao@golang.org>

    Fast-ish path for drawing onto an image.RGBA destination.
    
    Time to draw.Draw a 200x200 image fell from 18.4ms (and 1 malloc) to
    5.6ms (and 0 mallocs). It's still relatively slow since it assumes
    nothing about the src or mask images, but it does remove the malloc.
    There are existing faster, more specialized paths for copies, fills
    and image glyph masks.
    
    Also added a "compare to a slow but obviously correct implementation"
    check to draw_test.go.
