    cmd/doc: make local dot-slash path names work
    
    Before, an argument that started ./ or ../ was not treated as
    a package relative to the current directory. Thus
    
            $ cd $GOROOT/src/text
            $ go doc ./template
    
    could find html/template as $GOROOT/src/html/./template
    is a valid Go source directory.
    
    Fix this by catching such paths and making them absolute before
    processing.
    
    Fixes #23383.
