    crypto/x509: ignore non-critical email constraints
    
    Previously we tried to parse email constraints as the maximum base
    distance (which is unused and must be omitted according to RFC 5280)
    because they share the same tag number. Rather than complicate the
    code further, this CL just ignores the unused values.
