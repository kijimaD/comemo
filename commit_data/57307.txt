    net: make mustHaveExternalNetwork work as usual on GOOS=linux
    
    I considered deleting mustHaveExternalNetwork in favor of just using
    the real testenv.MustHaveExternalNetwork. That certainly makes these
    tests that call it easier to understand. But that negatively affects
    some ports that don't have a longtest builder as it'd make the tests
    not run automatically on any builder at all.
    
    So, make a minimal change that applies only to GOOS=linux for now.
    If we make more progress on establishing -longtest builders for all
    ports, this intermediate layer helper will cease to have any benefit
    and can be deleted in favor of the one in testenv package.
