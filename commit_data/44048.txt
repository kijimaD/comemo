    runtime: use _exit on darwin
    
    On darwin, where we use libc for syscalls, when the runtime exits,
    it calls libc exit function, which may call back into user code,
    e.g. invoking functions registered with atexit. In particular, it
    may call back into Go. But at this point, the Go runtime is
    already exiting, so this wouldn't work.
    
    On non-libc platforms we use exit syscall directly, which doesn't
    invoke any callbacks. Use _exit on darwin to achieve the same
    behavior.
    
    No test for now, as it doesn't pass on all platforms (see trybot
    run of PS2).
    
    May fix #42465.
    May fix #43294.
