    os: handle TMPDIR in TempDir on Plan 9
    
    CL 129063 added a test in TestScript/mod_enabled,
    which was failing on Plan 9.
    
    The test was failing because the Init function
    of the cmd/go/internal/modload package was
    expecting ModRoot to be part of os.TempDir.
    
    However, ModRoot was set to TMPDIR, while
    os.TempDir is returning /tmp on Plan 9.
    
    This change fixes the implementation of
    os.TempDir on Plan 9 to handle the TMPDIR
    environment variable, similarly to Unix.
    
    Fixes #27065.
