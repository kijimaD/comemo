    cmd/dist: goc2c ignores GOROOT_FINAL
    
    When building golang, the environment variable GOROOT_FINAL can be set
    to indicate a different installation location from the build
    location. This works fine, except that the goc2c build step embeds
    line numbers in the resulting c source files that refer to the build
    location, no the install location.
    
    This would not be a big deal, except that in turn the linker uses the
    location of runtime/string.goc to embed the gdb script in the
    resulting binary and as a net result, the debugger now complains that
    the script is outside its load path (it has the install location
    configured).
    
    See https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8524 for the full
    description.
    
    Fixes #8524.
