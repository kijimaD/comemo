    doc/next: use relative link to Go issue
    
    The Go release notes are served on multiple domains (go.dev,
    golang.google.cn, tip.golang.org, localhost:8080 and so on), so links
    pointing to the Go website itself need to be relative to work in all
    those contexts.
    
    Caught by a test in x/website. The next CL adds the same test to this
    repository so these kinds of problems are caught sooner and with less
    friction.
    
    For #68545.
    Fixes #68575.
