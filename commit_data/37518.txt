    cmd/compile: begin OpArg and OpPhi location lists at block start
    
    For the entry block, make the "first instruction" be truly
    the first instruction.  This allows printing of incoming
    parameters with Delve.
    
    Also be sure Phis are marked as being at the start of their
    block.  This is observed to move location list pointers,
    and where moved, they become correct.
    
    Leading zero-width instructions include LoweredGetClosurePtr.
    Because this instruction is actually architecture-specific,
    and it is now tested for in 3 different places, also created
    Op.isLoweredGetClosurePtr() to reduce future surprises.
