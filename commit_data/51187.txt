    net/http: revert h2_bundle.go formatting change from CL 368254
    
    h2_bundle.go is automatically generated from x/net/http2. Any
    formatting changes within that file need to be first made upstream.
    
    This brings the contents of h2_bundle.go back in line with the
    upstream generator, fixing the cmd/internal/moddeps test that is
    currently failing on the longtest builders.
    
    For #49884
