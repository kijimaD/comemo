    image/gif: fix frame-inside-image bounds checking.
    
    The semantics of the Go image.Rectangle type is that the In and
    Intersects methods treat empty rectangles specially. There are multiple
    valid representations of an empty image.Rectangle. One of them is the
    zero image.Rectangle but there are others. They're obviously not all
    equal in the == sense, so we shouldn't use != to check GIF's semantics.
    
    This change will allow us to re-roll
    a855da29dbd7a80c4d87a421c1f88a8603c020fa "image: fix the overlap check
    in Rectangle.Intersect" which was rolled back in
    14347ee480968c712ea885a4ea62779fd8a0dc44.
