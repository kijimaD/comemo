    strconv: document handling of NaN and Â±Inf
    
    In addition to the example that was added in 203b80ab, mention these
    special cases in the doc comment. This change also adjusts the example
    to include "+Inf", as it was not otherwise mentioned that the plus
    symbol may be present.
    
    Fix #30990
