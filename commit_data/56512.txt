    cmd/go: fix swigOne action with -n
    
    Currently, if cmd/go builds a swig file with the -n (dry run) flag, it
    will print the swig command invocation without executing it, but then
    attempt to actually rename one of swig's output files, which will
    fail. Make this rename conditional on -n. While we're here, we fix the
    missing logging of the rename command with -x, too.
