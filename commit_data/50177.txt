    go/build: ignore package main files in TestDependencies
    
    The tree has package main files scattered around
    in it for the purposes of running go generate.
    
    They're all marked "// +build ignore",
    which gets special handling in TestDependencies.
    It would be nice to be able to use other build tags,
    such as "generate", as suggested by the go generate
    design doc. Plus the build tag syntax is changing.
    
    This change skips all "package main" files.
    By definition these aren't importable,
    so they can't contribute to the dependency tree.
    
    We can't quite eliminate the "// +build ignore"
    check, as it is used by packages runtime and syscall.
    But it's still a step in the right direction.
