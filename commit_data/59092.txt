    fmt: document how %#g handles infinities and NaNs
    
    The %#g format prints a "Go-syntax representation", but there is
    no such thing for IEEE754 infinities and NaNs, so just document
    what happens, which is that it prints +Inf, -Inf, or NaN.  We could
    show something like math.Inf(1) and math.Nan(), but that doesn't
    sit right, and anyway for NaNs you can't even recover the original
    value. Simpler and more honest to give up.
    
    Fixes #51486
