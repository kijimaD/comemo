    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: clean up some opcodes
    
    This does some clean up of the ppc64 opcodes to remove names
    from the opcode list that don't actually assemble. At one time
    names were added to this list to represent opcode "classes" to
    organize other opcodes that have the same set of operand
    combinations. Since this is not documented, it is confusing as
    to which opcodes can be used in an asm file and which can't, and
    which opcodes should be supported in the disassembler. It is
    clearer for the user if the list of Go opcodes are all opcodes
    that can be assembled with names that match the ppc64 opcode
    where possible.
    
    I found this when trying to use Go opcode XXLAND in an asm file
    which seems like it should map to ppc64 xxland but when used it
    gets this error:
    
    go tool asm test_xxland.s
    asm: bad r/r, r/r/r or r/r/r/r opcode XXLAND
    asm: assembly failed
    
    This change removes the opcodes that are only used for opcode
    "classes" and fixes the case statement where they are referenced.
    This also fixes XXLAND and XXPERM which are opcodes that should
    assemble to their corresponding ppc64 opcode but do not.
