    runtime: in traceback, only jump stack if M doesn't change
    
    CL 424257 modified gentraceback to switch gp when jumping from a
    system stack to a user stack to simplify reasoning through the rest of
    the function. This has the unintended side-effect of also switching
    all references to gp.m. The vast majority of the time, g0.m and curg.m
    are the same across a stack switch, making this a no-op, but there's
    at least one case where this isn't true: if a profiling signal happens
    in execute between setting mp.curg and setting gp.m. In this case,
    mp.curg.m is briefly nil, which can cause gentraceback to crash with a
    nil pointer dereference. We see this failure (surprisingly
    frequently!) in profiling tests in the morestack=mayMoreStackPreempt
    testing mode (#48297).
    
    Fix this by making only jumping stacks if doing so will not switch Ms.
    This restores the original property that gp.m doesn't change across
    the stack jump, and makes gentraceback a little more conservative
    about jumping stacks.
    
    Fixes #54885.
