    runtime: mmap(2) on Solaris & Illumos can return EAGAIN.
    
    In low memory situations mmap(2) on Illumos[2] can return EAGAIN when it
    is unable to reserve the necessary space for the requested mapping.  Go
    was not previously handling this correctly for Illumos and would fail to
    recognize it was in a low-memory situation, the result being the program
    would terminate with a panic instead of running the GC.
    
    Fixes: #14930
