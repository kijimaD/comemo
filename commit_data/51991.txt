    cmd/link/internal/ld: fix text section splitting for ARM
    
    Fix a problem with trampoline generation for ARM that was causing link
    failures when building selected k8s targets. Representative error
    (this is coming from the external linker):
    
      go.go:(.text+...): relocation truncated to fit: R_ARM_CALL against `runtime.duffcopy'
    
    The Go linker is supposed to be limiting text section size for ARM to
    0x1c00000 bytes, however due to a problem in the tramp generation
    phase this limit wasn't being enforced.
    
    Updates #58428.
    Fixes #58425.
