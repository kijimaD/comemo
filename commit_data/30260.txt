    runtime: remove rescan list
    
    With the hybrid barrier, rescanning stacks is no longer necessary so
    the rescan list is no longer necessary. Remove it.
    
    This leaves the gcrescanstacks GODEBUG variable, since it's useful for
    debugging, but changes it to simply walk all of the Gs to rescan
    stacks rather than using the rescan list.
    
    We could also remove g.gcscanvalid, which is effectively a distributed
    rescan list. However, it's still useful for gcrescanstacks mode and it
    adds little complexity, so we'll leave it in.
    
    Fixes #17099.
    Updates #17503.
