    runtime: fix plan9/amd64 build?
    
    The only thing I can see that is really Plan 9-specific
    is that the stack pointer used for signal handling used
    to have more mapped memory above it.
    Specifically it used to have at most 88 bytes (StackTop),
    so change the allocation of a 40-byte frame to a 128-byte frame.
    
    No idea if this will work, but worth a try.
    
    Note that "fix" here means get it back to timing out
    instead of crashing.
