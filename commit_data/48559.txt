    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: simplify formatting of defined types
    
    The existing code for deciding how to format defined type names is
    incredibly convoluted and difficult to follow. In particular, I'm
    looking at changing how Vargen works, and I couldn't tell from the
    existing code whether my idea was viable.
    
    This CL overhauls the logic to be much simpler with fewer special
    cases, while overall behaving the same. A few notable intentional
    differences from how the current code works:
    
    1. The old code replaced the 'S' verb for fmtTypeGo and fmtTypeDebug
    to 'v', whereas the new code leaves it alone. There's currently no
    code that actually uses 'S' with these modes anyway, so it doesn't
    seem important to maintain this special case. If future code wants 'v'
    formatting, it should just use 'v' instead of 'S'.
    
    2. The old code included Vargen for fmtTypeIDName mode with the 'S'
    verb; but again, this functionality isn't actually used. I think it
    would make sense for fmtTypeIDName to include Vargen like fmtTypeID
    does (Vargen is logically part of the type's identity after all), but
    that breaks tests and toolstash -cmp. So for now, this is left as a
    TODO to investigate in the future.
    
    3. The old code only added Vargen for fmtTypeID in 'v' mode when
    printing types from the local package. But because we don't currently
    support exporting function-scoped defined types anyway, this is again
    irrelevant. In fact, once we *do* support exporting function-scoped
    defined types, we'll need to include Vargen to generate the linker
    symbols correctly.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
