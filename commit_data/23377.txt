    runtime: detect and print corrupted free lists
    
    Issues #10240, #10541, #10941, #11023, #11027 and possibly others are
    indicating memory corruption in the runtime. One of the easiest places
    to both get corruption and detect it is in the allocator's free lists
    since they appear throughout memory and follow strict invariants. This
    commit adds a check when sweeping a span that its free list is sane
    and, if not, it prints the corrupted free list and panics. Hopefully
    this will help us collect more information on these failures.
