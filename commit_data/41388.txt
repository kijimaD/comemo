    doc: remove double mention of custom workspace
    
    In the GOPATH section of the 'How To Write Go Code' document, it is
    mentioned two times in the span of a few lines that one can set GOPATH
    to a custom workspace path. The two paragraphs say basically the same
    thing, and they both link to golang.org/wiki/SettingGOPATH, so I'm
    quite sure the duplication is not intentional.
    
    This change deletes the second occurrence.
