    cmd/compile: be more specific in cannot assign errors
    
    "cannot assign to" compiler errors are very laconic: they never
    explain why the lhs cannot be assigned to (with one exception, when
    assigning to a struct field in a map).
    
    This change makes them a little more specific, in two more cases: when
    assigning to a string, or to a const; by giving a very brief reason
    why the lhs cannot be assigned to.
