    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: add Node field getters and setters
    
    The goal is to move Node to being an interface and then break
    up the one big struct into many implementations.
    
    Step 1 is to convert all current uses of Node to only use methods,
    so that the existing algorithms keep working even as the underlying
    implementations are adjusted.
    
    Step 0 - this CL - is to add the getters and setters for Step 1.
