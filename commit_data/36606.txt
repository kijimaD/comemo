    cmd/vet: assume that no builtin funcs are pure
    
    That was the intention with the existing code, but it was buggy; builtin
    functions aren't treated as values by types.TypeAndVal. Thus, we should
    use the IsBuiltin method instead of IsValue.
    
    Teaching vet what builtin funcs are pure is already being tracked as a
    separate issue, #22851.
    
    While at it, also add a test with methods, just to be sure that the
    current logic doesn't break with that edge case either.
    
    Fixes #25303.
