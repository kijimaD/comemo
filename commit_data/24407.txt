    cmd/go: import runtime/cgo into darwin/arm64 tests
    
    Until cl/12721 and cl/12574, all standard library tests included
    runtime/cgo on darwin/arm64 by virtue of package os including it. Now
    that is no longer true, runtime/cgo needs to be added by the go tool
    just as it is for darwin/arm. (This installs the Mach exception
    handler used to properly handle EXC_BAD_ACCESS.)
    
    Fixes #11901
