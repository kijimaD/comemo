    cmd/go: quote fragments in CGO_ env variables reported by 'go env'
    
    These fields have been parsed as quoted fields since CL 334732,
    but we missed the unparsing side in 'go env'.
    
    Certain scripts (notably make.ba{sh,t}) expect to be able to set the
    environment to exactly what 'go env' reports, so for round-trip
    purposes it is important to match the marshaling and unmarshaling
    functions.
    
    (Noticed while debugging #52009.)
    Updates #41400
