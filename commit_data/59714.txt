    runtime/trace: add a trace validation test for different trace orders
    
    This adds a test which validates the traces generated by the execution
    tracer and the flight recorder depending on the order where they are
    stopped and started. This test uncovered that under certain
    circumstances, the traces which were produced would possibly be
    missing the trace header. All traces have the trace headers included
    now. Clock snapshot checks have been disabled for Windows and WASM.
