    Revert "path/filepath: change IsAbs("NUL") to return true"
    
    This reverts commit d154ef60a0c88be98c70bbe1c5735fb7b1f45250.
    
    This change made IsAbs return true for certain reserved filenames,
    but does not consistently detect reserved names. For example,
    "./COM1", "//./COM1", and (on some Windows versions) "COM1.txt"
    all refer to the COM1 device, but IsAbs detects none of them.
    
    Since NUL is not an absolute path, do not attempt to detect it
    or other device paths in IsAbs. See #56217 for more discussion
    of IsAbs and device paths.
    
    For #56217.
