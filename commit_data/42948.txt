    unicode/utf8: refactor benchmarks for FullRune function
    
    BenchmarkFullASCIIRune tests the performance of function utf8.FullRune,
    which will be inlined in BenchmarkFullASCIIRune. Since the return value
    of FullRune is not referenced, it will be removed as dead code.
    
    This CL makes the FullRune functions return value referenced by a global
    variable to avoid this point. In addition, this CL adds one more benchmark
    to cover more code paths, and puts them together as sub benchmarks of
    BenchmarkFullRune.
