    http: fix racy test with a simpler version
    
    This was seen breaking the slow arm5 builder:
    http://godashboard.appspot.com/log/ec54ee302a70c07093e8f5c47454b3eb48768b77e1d8cc7943d8951f8b6696be
    
    The test was unnecessarily complex and didn't benefit from
    using httptest.Server. That just got in the way.
