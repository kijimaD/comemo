    reflect: deprecate (Slice|String)Header
    
    As discussed in CL 401434 there are substantial misuses of these in the
    wild, and they are a potential source of unsafety even for code that
    does not use them directly.
    
    We should either keep them as-is and document when/how they can be used
    safely, or deprecate them so that uses will eventually die out.
    
    After some discussion, it was decided to deprecate them outright.
    Since the docs already mentioned that they may be unstable across
    releases, it should be possible to get rid of them completely later on.
