    net/http: test index exhaustively
    
    Replace the fuzz test with one that enumerates all relevant patterns
    up to a certain length.
    
    For conflict detection, we don't need to check every possible method,
    host and segment, only a few that cover all the possibilities. There
    are only 2400 distinct patterns in the corpus we generate, and the
    test generates, indexes and compares them all in about a quarter of a
    second.
