commit 986582126a371ff927182ba6e61e364c1341171a

    runtime: avoid monotonic time zero on systems with low-res timers
    
    Otherwise low-res timers cause problems at call sites that expect to
    be able to use 0 as meaning "no time set" and therefore expect that
    nanotime never returns 0 itself. For example, sched.lastpoll == 0
    means no last poll.
    
    Fixes #22394.
