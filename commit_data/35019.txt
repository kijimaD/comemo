    os/exec: remove "binary" when talking about executables
    
    The use of binary was incorrect as executable files can also be scripts.
    
    The docs for Error are also reworded. The old docs implied that Error was
    returned when attempting to start an executable, which is not correct: it
    was returned by LookPath when the file was not found or did not have the
    attributes of an executable.
