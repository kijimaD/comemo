    runtime: remove an arbitrary timeout in TestProfBuf
    
    The failure observed in
    https://build.golang.org/log/766ad55d098ee1979ba1ae261e0813063567743e
    appears to be spurious. If it is, this change will fix it.
    
    If it is not, and somehow the Read has deadlocked,
    then this change will help to diagnose it
    (by causing the test to time out and dump its running goroutines).
    
    For #56196.
