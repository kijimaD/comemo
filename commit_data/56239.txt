    runtime: mix a bit more in arm64 hash function
    
    We really need 3 mix steps between the data being hashed and the output.
    One mix can only spread a 1 bit change to 32 bits. The second mix
    can spread to all 128 bits, but the spread is not complete. A third mix
    spreads out ~evenly to all 128 bits.
    
    The amd64 version has 3 mix steps.
    
    Fixes #59643
