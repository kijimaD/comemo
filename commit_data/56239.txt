    cmd/go: only attempt to match subset of $GOCACHE in test
    
    This test attempted to be clever by looking for the entirety of $GOCACHE
    in the compile command line to ensure that the profile was coming from
    cache.
    
    Unfortunately, on Windows $GOCACHE contains \, which needs extra
    escaping in a regexp. As an approximate alternative, just look for the
    "gocache" component specified when defining GOCACHE.
    
    This fixes the Windows longtest builders.
