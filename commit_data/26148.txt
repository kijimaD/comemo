    debug/elf: rename Chdr64.Reserved to _
    
    This future-proofs the Chdr64 structure against later versions of ELF
    defining this field and declutters the documentation without changing
    the layout of the struct.
    
    This structure does not exist in the current release, so this change
    is safe.
