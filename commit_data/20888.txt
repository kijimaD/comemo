    encoding/csv: for Postgres, unquote empty strings, quote \.
    
    In theory both of these lines encode the same three fields:
    
            a,,c
            a,"",c
    
    However, Postgres defines that when importing CSV, the unquoted
    version is treated as NULL (missing), while the quoted version is
    treated as a string value (empty string). If the middle field is supposed to
    be an integer value, the first line can be imported (NULL is okay), but
    the second line cannot (empty string is not).
    
    Postgres's import command (COPY FROM) has an option to force
    the unquoted empty to be interpreted as a string but it does not
    have an option to force the quoted empty to be interpreted as a NULL.
    
    From http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-copy.html:
    
            The CSV format has no standard way to distinguish a NULL
            value from an empty string. PostgreSQL's COPY handles this
            by quoting. A NULL is output as the NULL parameter string
            and is not quoted, while a non-NULL value matching the NULL
            parameter string is quoted. For example, with the default
            settings, a NULL is written as an unquoted empty string,
            while an empty string data value is written with double
            quotes (""). Reading values follows similar rules. You can
            use FORCE_NOT_NULL to prevent NULL input comparisons for
            specific columns.
    
    Therefore printing the unquoted empty is more flexible for
    imports into Postgres than printing the quoted empty.
    
    In addition to making the output more useful with Postgres, not
    quoting empty strings makes the output smaller and easier to read.
    It also matches the behavior of Microsoft Excel and Google Drive.
    
    Since we are here and making concessions for Postgres, handle this
    case too (again quoting the Postgres docs):
    
            Because backslash is not a special character in the CSV
            format, \., the end-of-data marker, could also appear as a
            data value. To avoid any misinterpretation, a \. data value
            appearing as a lone entry on a line is automatically quoted
            on output, and on input, if quoted, is not interpreted as
            the end-of-data marker. If you are loading a file created by
            another application that has a single unquoted column and
            might have a value of \., you might need to quote that value
            in the input file.
    
    Fixes #7586.
