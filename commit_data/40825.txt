    runtime: add a test for getg with thread switch
    
    With gccgo, if we generate getg inlined, the backend may cache
    the address of the TLS variable, which will become invalid after
    a thread switch.
    
    Currently there is no known bug for this. But if we didn't
    implement this carefully, we may get subtle bugs. This CL adds a
    test that will fail loudly if this is wrong. (See also
    https://go.googlesource.com/gofrontend/+/refs/heads/master/libgo/runtime/proc.c#333
    and an incorrect attempt CL 185337.)
    
    Note: at least on Linux/AMD64, even with an incorrect
    implementation, this only fails if the test is compiled with
    -fPIC, which is not the default setting for gccgo test suite. So
    some manual work is needed. Maybe we could extend the test suite
    to run the runtime test with more settings (e.g. PIC and static).
