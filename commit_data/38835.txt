    go/internal/gccgoimporter: improve alias handling for anonymous fields
    
    The code in the parser that deals with anonymous structure fields
    records the fact that a field is anonymous, then tries to install a proxy
    name for the field based on the name of the type used to declare
    the field. If that type was an alias, the current recipe for determining
    the proxy name was not working properly; enhance the code to recover
    and report the alias name used.
    
    Fixes #31540.
