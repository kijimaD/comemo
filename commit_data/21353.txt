    cmd/gc: fix range typecheck order
    
    Typecheck for range variables before typechecking for range body.
    Body can refer to new vars declared in for range,
    so it is preferable to typecheck them before the body.
    Makes typecheck order consistent between ORANGE and OFOR.
    
    This come up during another change that computes some predicates
    on variables during typechecking.
