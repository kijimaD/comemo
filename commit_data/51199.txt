   This includes major - but fully backward-compatible - changes to the language.

+  These new language changes required a large amount of new code that
+  has not had significant testing in production settings. That will
+  only happen as more people write and use generic code. We believe
+  that this feature is well implemented and high quality. However,
+  unlike most aspects of Go, we can't back up that belief with real
+  world experience. Therefore, while we encourage the use of generics
+  where it makes sense, please use appropriate caution when deploying
+  generic code in production.
