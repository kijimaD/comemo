    runtime: fix gccheckmark mode and enable by default
    
    It was testing the mark bits on what roots pointed at,
    but not the remainder of the live heap, because in
    CL 2991 I accidentally inverted this check during
    refactoring.
    
    The next CL will turn it back off by default again,
    but I want one run on the builders with the full
    checkmark checks.
