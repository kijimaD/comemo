    net: fix TestDialGoogle with -ipv6 when CGO_ENABLED=0
    
    Under some dial tests that require external network connectivity, we
    must prevent application traffic but must not interfere with control
    plane traffic such as DNS message exchange. But test helper function
    disableSocketConnect prevents both application and control plane traffic
    unconditionally and makes some dial tests with -ipv6 fail when
    CGO_ENABLED=0.
    
    This change makes disableSocketConnect take a look at not only address
    family but socket type for fixing some dial tests with -ipv6 when
    CGO_ENBALED=0.
