    crypto/x509: add code for dealing with PKIX public keys.
    
    We also have functions for dealing with PKCS#1 private keys. This
    change adds functions for PKIX /public/ keys. Most of the time one
    won't be parsing them because they usually come in certificates, but
    marshaling them happens and I've previously copied the code from
    x509.go for this.
