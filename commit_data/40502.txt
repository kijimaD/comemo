    internal/envcmd: print GO111MODULE when executing "go env"
    
    If we look at the issues in the past releases that are related
    to go command that involved modules, its usually mention or ask about
    the value of GO111MODULE, either in separate line or in separate
    comment.
    
    There are quite long time range before GO111MODULE will be removed
    (unused).  The next release is still default to auto [1], and until Go
    1.13 unsupported (two releases after that) there is about one and half
    years after that.
    
    Since the change is not that big (one line) [2], maybe temporary adding
    it to "go env" give more clarity and benefit in issue reporting rather
    than not.
