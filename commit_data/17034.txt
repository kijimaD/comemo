    cmd/gc: get rid of redundant slice bound check.
    
    For normal slices a[i:j] we're generating 3 bounds
    checks: j<={len(string),cap(slice)}, j<=j (!), and i<=j.
    Somehow snuck in as part of the [i:j:k] implementation
    where the second check does something.
    Remove the second check when we don't need it.
