    cmd/dist: run commands in $GOROOT/src not $GOROOT when possible
    
    The go command prints paths in errors relative to its current directory.
    Since all.bash and run.bash are run in $GOROOT/src, prefer to run
    the go command, so that the relative paths are correct.
    
    Before this CL, running all.bash in $GOROOT/src:
    
            ##### Testing race detector
            # net/http
            src/net/http/transport.go:1257: cannot take the address of <node EFACE>
    
    This is wrong (or at least less useful) because there is no $GOROOT/src/src/net/http directory.
