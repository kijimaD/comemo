commit 94934f843ee8b0a4a09dc336d4e2b57601b34206

    runtime: rewrite addb/subtractb to be simpler to compile; introduce add1, subtract1
    
    This reduces the depth of the inlining at a particular call site.
    The inliner introduces many temporary variables, and the compiler can do
    a better job with fewer. Being verbose in the bodies of these helper functions
    seems like a reasonable tradeoff: the uses are still just as readable, and
    they run faster in some important cases.
