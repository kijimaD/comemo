    runtime: fix netbsd runtime defs
    
    Fix and regenerate runtime defs for NetBSD.
    
    Whilst the mcontext struct can be handled across architectures,
    the registers are provided as defines that index an array, rather
    than as members of the struct. Since these are architecture
    dependent, include them via a defs_netbsd_<arch>.go file.
