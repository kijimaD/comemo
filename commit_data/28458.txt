    time: allow long fractions in ParseDuration
    
    The code scanned for an integer after a decimal point, which
    meant things could overflow if the number was very precise
    (0.1234123412341234123412342134s). This fix changes the
    parser to stop adding precision once we run out of bits, rather
    than trigger an erroneous overflow.
    
    We could parse durations using floating-point arithmetic,
    but since the type is int64 and float64 has only has 53 bits
    of precision, that would be imprecise.
    
    Fixes #15011.
