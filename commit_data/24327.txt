    encoding/xml: EncodeToken silently eats tokens with invalid type
    
    EncodeToken takes a Token (i.e. an interface{}) as a parameter,
    and expects a value of type StartElement, EndElement, CharData,
    Comment, ProcInst, or Directive.
    
    If a pointer is passed instead, or any type which does not match
    this list, the token is silently ignored.
    
    Added a default case in the type switch to issue a proper error
    when the type is invalid.
    
    The behavior could be later improved by allowing pointers to
    token to be accepted as well, but not for go1.5.
    
    Fixes #11719
