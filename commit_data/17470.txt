commit 780f5b714dfe9ede57e85cbb804d015981878df4

    reflect: do not cache trivial values in DeepEqual.
    
    DeepEqual caches addresses of compared values
    each time it visits addressable values. This is
    more expensive than actually comparing them in
    the common case of large slices of bytes or integers.
    
    Also add a fast path for slices with identical
    underlying array.
