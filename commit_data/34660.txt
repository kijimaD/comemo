    cmd/go: drop runtime, runtime/internal/sys, runtime/internal/atomic, unsafe as deps of everything
    
    This was a hack to make a new make.bash avoid reusing installed packages.
    The new content-based staleness is precise enough not to need this hack;
    now it's just causing unnecessary rebuilds: if a package doesn't import "runtime",
    for example, it doesn't need to be recompiled when runtime changes.
    (It does need to be relinked, and we still arrange that.)
