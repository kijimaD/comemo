    runtime: do not explicitly exit on ctrl handler
    
    The default ctrl+c handler should process exits in situations where it
    makes sense, like console apps, but not in situations where it doesn't,
    like libraries or services. Therefore, we should remove the exit(2) so
    that the default handler is used for this. This also uses the more
    proper windows exit code of STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT, with the base case
    handler installed by KernelBase.dll. In particular, this helps in the
    case of services, which previously would terminate when receiving
    shutdown signals, instead of passing them onward to the service program.
    In this CL, contrary to CL 244959, we do not need to special case
    services with expensive detection algorithms, or rely on hard-coded
    library/archive flags.
    
    Fixes #40167.
    Fixes #40074.
