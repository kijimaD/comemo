    cmd/link: remove silly sym.R[:0] truncation
    
    The DWARF code currently clears all section relocations every time it
    creates a section. This is unnecessary and confusing, so don't do it.
    
    This dates back to
    https://codereview.appspot.com/7891044/diff/26001/src/cmd/ld/dwarf.c.
    At the time, this was only done for one symbol and that symbol was
    used solely for collecting relocations (which is why it made sense to
    clear the relocations but not the actual data). Furthermore, DWARF
    generation potentially required two passes, so it was important to
    clear the state from the first pass. None of this is true now, but
    this pattern had been cargo-culted all over the dwarf.go.
