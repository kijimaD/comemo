    cmd/compile: better handling for PAUTOHEAP in DWARF inline gen
    
    When generating DWARF inline info records, the post-SSA code looks
    through the original "pre-inline" dcl list for the function so as to
    handle situations where formal params are promoted or optimized away.
    This code was not properly handling the case where an output parameter
    was promoted to the heap -- in this case the param node is converted
    in place from class PPARAMOUT to class PAUTOHEAP. This caused
    inconsistencies later on, since the variable entry in the abstract
    subprogram DIE wound up as a local and not an output parameter.
    
    Fixes #30908.
