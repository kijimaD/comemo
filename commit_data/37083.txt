    cmd/compile: schedule OpArg earlier in blocks for better debugging
    
    The location list for OpArg starts where the OpArg appears;
    this is not necessarily as soon as the OpArg coulde be
    observed, and it is reasonable for a user to expect that
    if a breakpoint is set "on f" then the arguments to f will
    be observable where that breakpoint happens to be set (this
    may also require setting the breakpoint after the prologue,
    but that is another issue).
