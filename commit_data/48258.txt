    crypto/sha512: add BE support to PPC64 asm implementation
    
    This adds big endian support for the assembly implementation of
    sha512. There was a recent request to do this for sha256 for
    AIX users; for completeness, the same is being done for sha512.
    The majority of the code is common between big and little
    endian with a few differences controlled by ifdefs: with LE
    the generation of a mask is needed along with VPERM instructions
    to put bytes in the correct order; some VPERMs need the V
    registers in a different order.
