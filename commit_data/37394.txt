    net/http: fix and normalize the [Server.][ListenAnd]Serve[TLS] docs
    
    The only inaccurate part was the HTTP/2 caveat in Server.ServeTLS, which
    only applies to the plain Serve variant.
    
    The restriction implemented in shouldConfigureHTTP2ForServe is not on
    the setupHTTP2_ServeTLS codepath because ServeTLS owns the tls.Listener,
    so we fix it for the user instead of disabling HTTP/2.
    
    Fixes #24607
