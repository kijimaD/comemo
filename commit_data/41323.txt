    cmd/compile: add a flag to print the source line for generated rules
    
    When working on rulegen, I often find myself
    searching the rules files to find the source of
    generated code. Add a flag to make that easier.
    
    The flag needs to be off by default,
    so that adding a single rule doesn't cause a massive diff.
