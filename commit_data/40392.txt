    misc: delete benchcmp forwarding script
    
    benchcmp was moved out of misc into x/tools in CL 60100043 in 2014,
    and then replaced by a forwarding script in CL 82710043.
    Five years have since passed, and the forwarding script has outlived
    its usefulness. It's now more confusing than helpful. Delete it.
