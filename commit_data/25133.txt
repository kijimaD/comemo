    go/types: move gotype command into this directory
    
    This is a copy of x/tools/cmd/gotype/gotype.go with the corresponding
    x/tools/cmd/gotype/doc.go prepended and including a build tag (ignore).
    
    This way, go/types can be built unaffected. If we need the gotype command,
    it is trivially built in the go/types directory with: go build gotype.go .
    
    Fixes #12303.
