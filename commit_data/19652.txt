    runtime: properly restore registers in Solaris runtime·sigtramp
    
    We restored registers correctly in the usual case where the thread
    is a Go-managed thread and called runtime·sighandler, but we
    failed to do so when runtime·sigtramp was called on a cgo-created
    thread. In that case, runtime·sigtramp called runtime·badsignal,
    a Go function, and did not restore registers after it returned
