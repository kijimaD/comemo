    cmd/doc: if no top-level symbols match, look for methods
    
    Improving the usability further.
    
    Before:
    
    $ go doc bytes.Read
    doc: symbol Read not present in package bytes installed in "bytes"
    $
    
    After:
    $ go doc bytes.Read
    func (b *Buffer) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
        Read reads the next len(p) bytes from the buffer or until the buffer is drained.
        The return value n is the number of bytes read. If the buffer has no data to
        return, err is io.EOF (unless len(p) is zero); otherwise it is nil.
    func (r *Reader) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)
    $
