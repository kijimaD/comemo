    cmd/go: do not panic when computing Shlib for a package with no Target
    
    In module mode, a non-main package lacks an install target.
    
    The location of the .shlib corresponding to a given target is stored
    in a .shlibname file alongside its install target, so in module mode
    a non-main package also lacks a .shlibname file.
    
    This also implies that such a package cannot be installed with
    'go install -buildmode=linkshared', but that is a problem
    for another day.
    
    Fixes #35759
    Updates #34347
