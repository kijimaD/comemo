    cmd/compile: clean up buggy DWARF inlined info PC ranges
    
    Repair the code that generates PC ranges for DWARF inlined routine
    instances to insure that if II Y is a child of II X within the inline
    tree, X's ranges include the ranges from Y. This is similar to what
    we're already doing for DWARF scopes.
    
    Updates #33188.
