    misc/cgo/testplugin: avoid writing to GOROOT
    
    One of the 'go build' commands executed by this test passed the '-i'
    flag, which caused the 'go' command to attempt to install transitive
    standard-library dependencies to GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH_dynlink.
    
    That failed if GOROOT/pkg was not writable (for example, if GOROOT was
    owned by the root user, but the user running the test was not root).
    
    As far as I can tell the '-i' flag is not necessary in this test.
    Prior to the introduction of the build cache it may have been an
    optimization, but now that the build cache is required the '-i' flag
    only adds extra work.
    
    Updates #30316
