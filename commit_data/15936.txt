    crypto/rsa: don't correct private exponent unless needed.
    
    At some point in the past, I believe the GCD algorithm was setting d to
    be negative. The RSA code has been correcting that ever since but, now,
    it appears to have changed and the correction isn't needed.
    
    Having d be too large is harmless, it's just a little odd and I
    happened to notice.
