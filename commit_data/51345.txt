    crypto/x509: reduce boring test key size
    
    Generating 8192 bit keys times out on builders relatively frequently. We
    just need something that isn't a boringAllowCert allowed key size so we
    can test that a non-boringAllowCert signed intermediate works, so just
    use 512 instead since it'll be significantly faster.
    
    Fixes #56798
