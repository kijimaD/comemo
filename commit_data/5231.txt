    syscall package: document that errno is zeroed on success
    
    This is a documentation enhancement only, without any code
    change.
    
    The rationale for documenting this precisely is that Unix
    programmers who "know" that errno's value is undefined after
    a successful system call may be surprised otherwise and
    search to be sure that a zero errno may be relied upon after
    successful calls.
