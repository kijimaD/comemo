    net/http: add test confirming a connection reuse case
    
    Verify that for a server doing chunked encoding, with the final data
    and EOF arriving together, the client will reuse the connection even
    if it closes the body without seeing an EOF. The server sends at least
    one non-zero chunk and one zero chunk. This verifies that the client's
    bufio reading reads ahead and notes the EOF, so even if the JSON
    decoder doesn't read the EOF itself, as long as somebody sees it, a
    close won't forcible tear down the connection. This was true at least
    of https://golang.org/cl/21291
    
    No code change. Test already passed (even with lots of runs, including
    in race mode with randomized goroutine scheduling).
