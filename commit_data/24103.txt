    registry: Explain how GetMUIStringValue works and where it falls short
    
    GetMUIStringValue tries as a convenience to resolve string values even for pathless
    resource DLLs by searching the system directory (one of several paths used
    by the system's standard DLL search order algorithm). This would not be
    needed if regLoadMUIString searched for pathless DLLs itself, but it
    doesn't, instead it needs an absolute path, otherwise it will fail.
    
    This approach works fine for solving issue #12015 (handle localized time
    zone names; for which GetMUIStringValue was created) since tzres.dll that
    is used to resolve localized time zone names has no path in the registry
    but is located under the system directory.
    
    However, this approach will fail if a pathless DLL is located somewhere
    else than the system directory.
    
    Because of this limitation GetMUIStringValue may have to be revised in the
    future to allow for custom paths, possibly through another version of the
    function.
