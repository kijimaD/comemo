    runtime: hold sched.lock over traceThreadDestroy in dropm
    
    This is required by traceThreadDestroy, though it's not strictly
    necessary in this case. The requirement to hold sched.lock comes from
    the assumption that traceThreadDestroy is getting called when the thread
    leaves the tracer's view, but in this case the extra m that dropm is
    dropping never leaves the allm list. Nevertheless, traceThreadDestroy
    requires it just as a safety measure, and that's reasonable. dropm is
    generally rare on pthread platforms, so the extra lock acquire over this
    short critical section (and only when tracing is enabled) is fine.
