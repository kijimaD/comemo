    compress/flate,compress/lzw: fix incorrect godoc links
    
    Fix incorrect godoc links related to the use of the name "Reader" for
    different things in the various compress/* packages:
    - in compress/flate Reader is the interface describing the underlying reader,
      not the decompressor as in other packages, so "returned reader" must
      not be linked to Reader.
    - in compress/lzw and compress/gzip Reader is the decompressor, not the
      interface of the underlying reader, so "underlying reader" must not
      be linked to Reader.
    
    With this patch the formatting of "underlying reader" and "returned
    reader" is consistent accross compress/* packages.
