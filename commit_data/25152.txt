    net/http: convert TestSetsRemoteAddr to use clientServerTest
    
    This is an example of converting an old HTTP/1-only test to test
    against both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.
    
    Please send more of these!
    
    Also, for comparing the http.Transport's responses between HTTP/1 and
    HTTP/2, see clientserver_test.go's h12Compare type and tests using
    h12Compare. Sometimes that's the more appropriate option.
