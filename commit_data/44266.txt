    runtime: move sys.DefaultGoroot to runtime.defaultGOROOT
    
    The default GOROOT has nothing to do with system details.
    Move it next to its one use in package runtime.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
