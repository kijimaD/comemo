    cmd/doc: search the tree in breadth-first order
    
    This is a simple change to the command that should resolve problems like finding
    vendored packages before their non-vendored siblings. By searching in breadth-first
    order, we find the matching package lowest in the hierarchy, which is more likely
    to be correct than the deeper one, such as a vendored package, that will be found
    in a depth-first scan.
    
    This may be sufficient to resolve the issue, and has the merit that it is very easy
    to explain. I will leave the issue open for now in case my intuition is wrong.
    
    Update #12423
