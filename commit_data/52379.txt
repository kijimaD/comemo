    os/signal: scale back the solaris-amd64-oraclerel settle time
    
    The settleTime is arbitrary. Ideally we should refactor the test to
    avoid it (using subprocesses instead of sleeps to isolate tests from
    each others' delayed signals), but as a shorter-term workaround let's
    try scaling it back to match linux/ppc64 (the other builder that
    empirically requires a longer settleTime).
    
    For #51054.
    Updates #33174.
