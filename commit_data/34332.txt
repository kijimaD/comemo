    crypto/x509: tighten EKU checking for requested EKUs.
    
    There are, sadly, many exceptions to EKU checking to reflect mistakes
    that CAs have made in practice. However, the requirements for checking
    requested EKUs against the leaf should be tighter than for checking leaf
    EKUs against a CA.
    
    Fixes #23884
