    crypto/openpgp/packet: add basic routines
    
    Since nobody suggested major changes to the higher level API, I'm
    splitting up the lower level code for review. This is the first of the
    changes for the packet reading/writing code.
    
    It deliberately doesn't include a Makefile because the package is
    incomplete.
