    runtime: don't adjust GC trigger on forced GC
    
    Forced GCs don't provide good information about how to adjust the GC
    trigger. Currently we avoid adjusting the trigger on forced GC because
    forced GC is also STW and we don't adjust the trigger on STW GC.
    However, this will become a problem when forced GC is concurrent.
    
    Fix this by skipping trigger adjustment if the GC was user-forced.
    
    For #18216.
