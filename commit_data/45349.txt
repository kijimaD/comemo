    cmd/compile: fix nodedump output for types of nodes
    
    The Dbg dumping of complex types was broken, because (I think) of a
    recent change to handle recursive types correctly. Before this fix,
    the Dump output of a closure node (where the last thing on the line is
    the type of the node) was:
    
    .   .   CLOSURE l(8) esc(h) tc(1) FUNC-@0
    
    after this change it is:
    
    .   .   CLOSURE l(8) esc(h) tc(1) FUNC-func(int) int
    
    The problem is that that the 'mode == Fdbg' code was immediately
    aborting the descent into tconv2, since it was calling down with the
    same node that was just entered into the hash table.
