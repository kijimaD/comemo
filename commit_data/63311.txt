    cmd/dist: always include variant in package names
    
    Our attempt to evenly distribute tests across shards struggles a bit
    because certain long-running targets are very difficult to distinguish
    in ResultDB, namely racebench and the test directory tests. These are
    the only tests where the JSON output from dist omits the variant from
    the package, making it impossible to distinguish them in the test result
    data. My current suspicion is that this is preventing the load balancing
    from being effective for the race builders in particular, though I worry
    the longtest builders have a similar situation with the test directory
    tests.
    
    For #65814.
