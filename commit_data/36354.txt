    cmd/compile: don't compact liveness maps in place
    
    Currently Liveness.compact rewrites the Liveness.livevars slice in
    place. However, we're about to add register maps, which we'll want to
    track in livevars, but compact independently from the stack maps.
    Hence, this CL modifies Liveness.compact to consume Liveness.livevars
    and produce a new slice of deduplicated stack maps. This is somewhat
    clearer anyway because it avoids potential confusion over how
    Liveness.livevars is indexed.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
    
    For #24543.
