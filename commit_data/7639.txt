    cgo: use correct frame size for 0 arguments
    
    Passing a frame size of 1 was causing the cgo callback
    to push 1 byte of arguments onto the stack, making
    the stack pointer misaligned, which had the effect of
    hiding all the pointers on the stack from the garbage
    collector.
    
    SWIG only wraps calls to C++ virtual methods, so it
    always has at least 1 argument, so SWIG does not need
    to be fixed too.
    
    Fixes #1328.
