    cmd/compile: testing harness for checking generated assembly
    
    Add a test which compiles a function and checks the
    generated assembly to make sure certain patterns are present.
    This test allows us to do white box tests of the compiler
    to make sure optimizations don't regress.
    
    Added a few simple tests for now.  More to come.
