    io: clarify documentation for io.ByteReader on error values
    
    Document that the byte value returned by ReadByte() is meaningless
    if its error != nil. Because io.Reader and io.ByteReader are similar in
    name, this CL aims to clear up any ambiguity surrounding the returned
    values, particularly where io.Reader is allowed to return both a
    non-zero number of valid bytes and err == EOF.
    
    Fixes #20825
