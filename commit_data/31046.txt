    cmd/compile: add ZeroWB case in writebarrier
    
    It looks like it should be there, although I couldn't find a test
    case that fails without it. ZeroWB is probably never generated now:
    zeroing an initialized heap object is done by making an autotmp on
    stack, zeroing it, and copying (typedmemmove) to heap.
    
    Passes "toolstash -cmp" on std.
