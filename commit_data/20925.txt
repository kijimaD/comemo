    cmd/go: add get -f flag
    
    get -u now checks that remote repo paths match the
    ones predicted by the import paths: if you are get -u'ing
    rsc.io/pdf, it has to be checked out from the right location.
    This is important in case the rsc.io/pdf redirect changes.
    
    In some cases, people have good reasons to use
    non-standard remote repos. Add -f flag to allow that.
    The f can stand for force or fork, as you see fit.
    
    Fixes #8850.
