    go/types, types2: correct alignment of atomic.Int64
    
    atomic.Int64 has special logic in the compiler to ensure it's 8-byte
    aligned on 32-bit architectures. The equivalent logic is missing in
    go/types, which means the compiler and go/types can come to different
    conclusions about the layout of types.
    
    Fix this by mirroring the compiler's logic into go/types.
    
    Fixes #53884.
