    cmd/compile: regenerate rewrite rules for amd64
    
    Sometimes, multiple CLs being merged that create rules on the same
    opcodes can cause the generated file to differ compared to a new
    regeneration. This is caused by the fact that rulegen splits
    generated functions in chunks of 10 rules per function (to avoid
    creating functions that are too big). If two CLs add rules to
    the same function, they might cause a generated function to
    have more than 10 rules, even though each CL individually didn't
    pass this limit.
