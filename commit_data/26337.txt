    cmd/compile: remove dead code handling '~' operator
    
    The parser code was not reachable ever since some of the lexer cleanups.
    We could recognize '~' in the lexer, complain, and return a '^' instead,
    but it's been a few years since Go was new and this may have been a use-
    ful error. The lexer complains with "illegal character U+007E '~'" which
    is good enough.
    
    For #13244.
