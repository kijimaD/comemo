    test: add test case for type parameter method indexing
    
    When types2 type checks a method expression or method value that
    selects a type parameter method, the Selection.Index is indexed based
    on the method's index within the type parameter's constraint
    interface.
    
    However, with a fully-stenciled implementation, naively using the
    index would result in picking a method from the corresponding type
    argument's full method set, which could select a different method.
    
    Unified IR currently avoids this because it selects methods based on
    name, not index; but experimenting with index-based selection revealed
    that there are no test cases that would have caught this failure case.
