    net: close the connection gracefully on Plan 9
    
    Previously, we used to write the "hangup" message to
    the TCP connection control file to be able to close
    a connection, while waking up the readers.
    
    The "hangup" message closes the TCP connection with a
    RST message. This is a problem when closing a connection
    consecutively to a write, because the reader may not have
    time to acknowledge the message before the connection is
    closed, resulting in loss of data.
    
    We use a "close" message, newly implemented in the Plan 9
    kernel to be able to close a TCP connection gracefully with a FIN.
    
    Updates #15464.
