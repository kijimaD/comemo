    cmd/go: remove ListModules call in runGet
    
    ListModules was used to download .info files so that 'go list -m all'
    would succeed later when offline. However, 'go list -m all' may
    already fail when offline after 'go mod tidy', so it doesn't make
    sense to add complexity to 'go get'.
    
    Instead, remove the ListModules call and fix the test that
    accidentally depended on it.
    
    For #42723
