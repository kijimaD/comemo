    README: update from CC-BY-3.0 to CC-BY-4.0
    
    CC-BY-3.0 was shiny and new back in 2009, but CC-BY-4.0 is
    generally preferred now. Update our CC-BY uses to CC-BY-4.0.
    
    Google lawyers signed off on the overall CC-BY-4.0 update
    and Renee French signed off on the update of the gopher license.
    
    See also CL 447156.
