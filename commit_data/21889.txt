    runtime: cache workbufs on Ms and add consistency checks
    
    Add local workbufs to the m struct in order to reduce contention.
    Add consistency checks for workbuf ownership.
    Chain workbufs through call change to avoid swapping them
    to and from the m struct.
    Adjust the size of the workbuf so that the mutators can
    more frequently pass modifications to the GC thus shifting
    some work from the STW mark termination phase to the concurrent
    mark phase.
