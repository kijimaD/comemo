    [dev.link] cmd/oldlink: decouple from goobj2 package
    
    The new object file support in the old linker should not be used.
    This is a minimal change that removes stuff from the old linker's
    loader package, so that it decouples from the goobj2 package,
    allowing the latter to evolve.
    
    Keep the change local in the loader package, so most of the old
    linker doesn't need to change. At this point I don't think we
    want to make significant changes to the old linker.
