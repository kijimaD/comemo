    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: don't store corpus in memory
    
    Instead of holding all corpus data/values in memory, only store seed
    inputs added via F.Add in memory, and only load corpus entries which
    are written to disk when we need them. This should significantly reduce
    the memory required by the coordinator process.
    
    Additionally only load the corpus in the coordinator process, since the
    worker has no need for it.
    
    Fixes #46669.
