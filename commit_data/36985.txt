    cmd/compile: avoid implicit bounds checks after explicit checks for append
    
    The generated code for the append builtin already checks if the appended
    to slice is large enough and calls growslice if that is not the case.
    Trust that this ensures the slice is large enough and avoid the
    implicit bounds check when slicing the slice to its new size.
    
    Removes 365 panicslice calls (-14%) from the go binary which
    reduces the binary size by ~12kbyte.
