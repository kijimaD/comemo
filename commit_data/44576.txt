    doc: add a release notes blurb on 1.16 linker improvements
    
    Add a draft version of a blurb on improvements to the linker. This
    will need to be finalized later in the release since there are still
    some additional changes to be made to the linker in 1.16.
    
    Updates #40703.

 <p>
-  TODO
+  This release includes additional improvements to the Go linker,
+  reducing linker resource usage (both time and memory) and improving
+  code robustness/maintainability. These changes form the second half
+  of a two-release project to
+  <a href="https://golang.org/s/better-linker">modernize the Go
+  linker</a>.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+  The linker changes in 1.16 extend the 1.15 improvements to all
+  supported architecture/OS combinations (the 1.15 performance improvements
+  were primarily focused on <code>ELF</code>-based OSes and
+  <code>amd64</code> architectures).  For a representative set of
+  large Go programs, linking is 20-35% faster than 1.15 and requires
+  5-15% less memory on average for <code>linux/amd64</code>, with larger
+  improvements for other architectures and OSes.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+  TODO: update with final numbers later in the release.
