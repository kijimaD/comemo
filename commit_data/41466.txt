    cmd/compile: remove statement marks from secondary calls
    
    Calls are code-generated in an alternate path that inherits
    its positions from values, not from *SSAGenState.  The
    default position on *SSAGenState was marked as not-a-statement,
    but this was not applied to the value itself, leading to
    spurious "is statement" marks in the output (convention:
    after code generation in the compiler, everything is either
    definitely a statement or definitely not a statement, nothing
    is in the undetermined state).
    
    This CL causes a 35 statement regression in ssa/stmtlines_test.
    This is down from the earlier 150 because of all the other
    CLs preceding this one that deal with the root causes of the
    missing lines (repeated lines on nested calls hid missing lines).
    
    This also removes some line repeats from ssa/debug_test.
