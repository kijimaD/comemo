    cmd/dist: allow $GO_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE to override timeoutScale
    
    Some machines are so slow that even with the default timeoutScale,
    they still timeout some tests. For example, currently some linux/arm
    builders and the openbsd/arm builder are timing out the runtime
    test and CL 8397 was proposed to skip some tests on openbsd/arm
    to fix the build.
    
    Instead of increasing timeoutScale or skipping tests, this CL
    introduces an environment variable $GO_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE that
    could be set to manually set a larger timeoutScale for those
    machines/builders.
    
    Fixes #10314.
