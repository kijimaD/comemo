    encoding/json: encode \b and \f as '\b' and '\f' in JSON strings
    
    According to RFC 8259, there are exactly 5 control characters
    that have a shorter escape sequence than the generic \uXXXX format.
    
    Over the years, we added ad-hoc support for the short sequences:
    * https://go.dev/cl/4678046 supports \r and \n
    * https://go.dev/cl/162340043 supports \t
    
    This CL completes the set by supporting \b and \f.
    
    This may change the encoding of strings in relatively rare cases,
    but is a permissible change since the Go 1 compatibility document does
    not guarantee that "json" produces byte-for-byte identical outputs.
    
    In fact, we have made even more observable output changes in the past
    such as with https://go.dev/cl/30371 which changes the representation
    of many JSON numbers.
    
    This change is to prepare the path forward for a potential
    v2 "json" package, which has more consistent encoding of JSON strings.
