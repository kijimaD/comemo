    cmd/cgo/internal/swig,cmd/go: reenable swig tests on 386
    
    CL 588938 skipped the tests because they were broken to unblock the
    builders, but we're fairly certain the reason they were failing is
    because we're missing g++-multilib. This change is intended to land once
    CL 589175 is deployed.
    
    Fixes #67698.
