    runtime: delete a very stale comment
    
    This comment claims mark termination re-scans stacks and uses the
    write barrier to determine how much of the stack needs to be
    rescanned. This hasn't been true since we introduced the hybrid write
    barrier and deleted stack rescanning with CL 31766 in Go 1.8.
    
    Updates #17503 I suppose.
