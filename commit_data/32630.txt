    net/http: make ServeMux preserve query string during redirects
    
    Ensure that the implicitly created redirect
    for
      "/route"
    after
      "/route/"
    has been registered doesn't lose the query string information.
    A previous attempt (https://golang.org/cl/43779) changed http.Redirect, however, that change broke direct calls to http.Redirect.
    To avoid that problem, this change touches ServeMux.Handler only.
    
    Fixes #17841
