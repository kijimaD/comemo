    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: avoid unnecessary pool literal usage for load/store pairs
    
    Implement better classification for load and store pair operations. This in
    turn allows us to avoid using pool literals when the offset fits in a 24 bit
    unsigned immediate. In this case, the offset can be calculated using two
    add immediate instructions, rather than loading the offset from the pool
    literal and then adding the offset to the base register. This requires the
    same number of instructions, however avoids a load from memory and does
    not require the offset to be stored in the literal pool.
