    cmd/compile:  deal with comparable embedded in a constraint
    
    Ignore an embedded type in an interface which is the predeclared
    interface "comparable" (which currently can only be in a type
    constraint), since the name doesn't resolve and the "comparable" type
    doesn't have any relevant methods (for the purposes of the compiler).
    
    Added new test case graph.go that needs this fix.
