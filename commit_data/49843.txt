    test: make issue54343.go robust against the tiny allocator
    
    I structured the test for issue54343.go after issue46725.go, where I
    was careful to use `[4]int`, which is a type large enough to avoid the
    tiny object allocator (which interferes with finalizer semantics). But
    in that test, I didn't note the importance of that type, so I
    mistakenly used just `int` in issue54343.go.
    
    This CL switches issue54343.go to use `[4]int` too, and then adds
    comments to both pointing out the significance of this type.
    
    Updates #54343.
