commit 0130a31366734fe0dd82a5c574437a3b6d2e1b28

    go_faq: a simple binary is a little smaller now
    About 10% for hello, world.
    Maybe more reductions will come.
    Also clarify that we're comparing printf against Printf
    (gcc can optimize aggressively, making this a different
    sort of comparison).
