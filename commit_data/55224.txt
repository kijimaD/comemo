    sync: document memory model for Swap/CompareAnd{Swap,Delete} in Map
    
    CL 381316 documented the memory model of Map's APIs. However, the newly
    introduced Swap, CompareAndSwap, and CompareAndDelete are missing from
    this documentation as CL 399094 did not add this info.
    
    This CL specifies the defined read/write operations of the new Map APIs.
    
    For #51972
