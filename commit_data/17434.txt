    regexp/syntax: optimize EmptyOpContext
    
    Minor. Saw this in a profile at few percent of CPU and was
    curious what it was. Improves overall regexp benchmarks
    anywhere from 0 to 3%, but they're a pain to run. You need to
    run them in isolation for long runs to get stable numbers.
    
    benchmark                  old ns/op    new ns/op    delta
    BenchmarkEmptyOpContext          537          473  -11.92%
