    misc/pprof: work with either LWP::UserAgent or curl
    
    Use either LWP::UserAgent or curl to make HTTP requests so it
    works on Windows (most Perl distros include LWP::UserAgent),
    and also on OS X (whose Perl at least sometimes doesn't
    include LWP::UserAgent).
    
    Fixes #6273
