    runtime: avoid clearing memory during byte slice allocation in gobytes
    
    Avoid using make in gobytes which clears the byte slice backing
    array unnecessarily since the content is overwritten immediately again.
    
    Check that the user provided length is positive and below the maximum
    allowed allocation size explicitly in gobytes as this was done in makeslice
    before this change.
    
    Fixes #23634
