 Statements in a statement list are separated by semicolons, which can be
 omitted in some cases as expressed by the OptSemicolon production.
-They are optional immediately after a closing parenthesis ")" terminating a
-list of declarations, or a closing brace terminating a type declaration or
-a block. Specifically, they cannot be omitted after the closing brace of a

+A semicolon may be omitted immediately following:
+
+	- a closing parenthesis ")" ending a list of declarations (§Declarations and scope rules)
+	- a closing brace "}" ending a type declaration (§Type declarations)
+	- a closing brace "}" ending a block (including switch and select statements)
+	- a label declaration (§Label declarations)

+In all other cases a semicolon is required to separate two statements. Since there
+is an empty statement, a statement list can always be ``terminated'' with a semicolon.
