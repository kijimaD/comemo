    cmd/go: deflake TestScript/test2json_interrupt
    
    - Start handling signals in 'go test' just before starting the test
      subprocess instead of just after. (It is unlikely that starting the
      process will cause cmd/go to hang in a way that requires signals to
      debug, and it is possible that something the test does — such as
      sending os.Interrupt to its parent processes — will immediately
      send a signal that needs to be handled.)
    
    - In the test-test, don't try to re-parse the parent PIDs after
      sending signals, and sleep for a much shorter time interval.
      (Overrunning the sleep caused the next call to strconv.Atoi — which
      shouldn't even happen! — to fail with a parse error, leading to the
      failure mode observed in
      https://build.golang.org/log/f0982dcfc6a362f9c737eec3e7072dcc7ef29e32.)
    
    Fixes #56083.
    Updates #53563.
