    misc/ios: retry iOS launch even if no device app path was found
    
    Now that the iOS exec wrapper uninstalls any existing test app before
    installing a new, looking up the device app path might fail. Before,
    the lookup always succeeded (even though the path reported might be
    stale).
    
    For the iOS builder.
