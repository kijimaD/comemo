    test: Make gccgo believe that the variables can change.
    
    This test is supposed to test runtime behaviour.  However,
    gccgo is smart enough to see that the variables are local to
    the package and that they never change.  Add a function so
    that gccgo thinks that the variables can in fact vary, so that
    the test works at runtime as expected.
