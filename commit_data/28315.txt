    runtime: perform publication barrier even for noscan objects
    
    Currently we only execute a publication barrier for scan objects (and
    skip it for noscan objects). This used to be okay because GC would
    never consult the object itself (so it wouldn't observe uninitialized
    memory even if it found a pointer to a noscan object), and the heap
    bitmap was pre-initialized to noscan.
    
    However, now we explicitly initialize the heap bitmap for noscan
    objects when we allocate them. While the GC will still never consult
    the contents of a noscan object, it does need to see the initialized
    heap bitmap. Hence, we need to execute a publication barrier to make
    the bitmap visible before user code can expose a pointer to the newly
    allocated object even for noscan objects.
