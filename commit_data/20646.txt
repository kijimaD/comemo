    go/build: do not consider "android.go" to be android-specific
    A file name must have a non-empty underscore-separated
    prefix before its suffix matches GOOS. This is what the
    documentation already said but is not what the code did.
    
    Fixes #8838.
    
    This needs to be called out in the release notes.
    The he single affected file
            code.google.com/p/go.text/collate/tools/colcmp/darwin.go
    could use a renaming but works because it has a build tag inside.
