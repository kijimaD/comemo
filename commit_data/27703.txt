    runtime: panic with the right error on iface conversion
    
    A straight conversion from a type T to an interface type I, where T does
    not implement I, should always panic with an interface conversion error
    that shows the missing method.  This was not happening if the conversion
    was done once using the comma-ok form (the result would not be OK) and
    then again in a straight conversion.  Due to an error in the runtime
    package the second conversion was failing with a nil pointer
    dereference.
    
    Fixes #16130.
