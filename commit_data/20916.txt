    doc/go_mem.html: don't be clever
    
    Add a short introductory section saying what most Go
    programmers really need to know, which is that you
    shouldn't have to read this document to understand
    the behavior of your program.

+<h2>Advice</h2>
+
+<p>
+Programs that modify data being simultaneously accessed by multiple goroutines
+must serialize such access.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+To serialize access, protect the data with channel operations or other synchronization primitives
+such as those in the <a href="/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
+and <a href="/pkg/sync/atomic/"><code>sync/atomic</code></a> packages.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+If you must read the rest of this document to understand the behavior of your program,
+you are being too clever.
