    runtime: eliminate unnecessary ragged barrier
    
    The ragged barrier after entering the concurrent mark phase is
    vestigial. This used to be the point where we enabled write barriers,
    so it was necessary to synchronize all Ps to ensure write barriers
    were enabled before any marking occurred. However, we've long since
    switched to enabling write barriers during the concurrent scan phase,
    so the start-the-world at the beginning of the concurrent scan phase
    ensures that all Ps have enabled the write barrier.
    
    Hence, we can eliminate the old "install write barrier" phase.
    
    Fixes #11971.
