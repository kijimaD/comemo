    net/http: update bundled http2, fix Transport memory leak
    
    Updates x/net/http2 to git rev 644ffc for three CLs since the last update:
    
    http2: don't add *Response to activeRes in Transport on Headers.END_STREAM
    https://golang.org/cl/19134
    
    http2: add mechanism to send undeclared Trailers mid handler
    https://golang.org/cl/19131
    
    http2: remove unused variable
    https://golang.org/cl/18936
    
    The first in the list above is the main fix that's necessary. The
    other are two are in the git history but along for the cmd/bundle
    ride. The middle CL is well-tested, small (mostly comments),
    non-tricky, and almost never seen (since nobody really uses Trailers).
    The final CL is just deleting an unused global variable.
    
    Fixes #14084 again (with more tests)
