    io: unexport internal methods
    
    The methods on the pipe type don't need to be exported. Doing so sets
    a bad precedent that it's OK to export methods to indicate an internal
    public API.  That's not a good idea in general, because exported methods
    increase cognitive load when reading code: the reader needs to consider
    whether the exported method might be used via some external interface
    or reflection.
