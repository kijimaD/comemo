    cmd/go: allow list of absolute directory path
    
    Relative directory paths have always worked.
    This CL makes absolute directory paths be handled the same way.
    (It was an oversight that they were excluded.)
    
    It also fixes the case of naming the directory holding source code
    for a package in a module dependency.
    
    Fixes #14177.
    Fixes #26550.
