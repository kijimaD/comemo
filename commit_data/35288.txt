    runtime: restore RSB for sigpanic call on mips64x
    
    preparePanic must set all registers expected by Go runtime conventions
    in case the sigpanic is being injected into C code. However, on
    mips64x it fails to restore RSB (R28). As a result, if C code modifies
    RSB and then raises a signal that turns into a sigpanic call, sigpanic
    may crash when it attempts to lock runtime.debuglock (the first global
    it references).
    
    Fix this by restoring RSB in the signal context using the same
    convention as main and sigtramp.
    
    Fixes #23641.
