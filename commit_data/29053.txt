    cmd/compile: added test to ensure that accidental fix remains
    
    Bug 15141 was apparently fixed by some other change to the
    compiler (this is plausible, it was a weird bug dependent
    on a particular way of returning a large named array result),
    add the test to ensure that it stays fixed.
    
    Updates #15141.
