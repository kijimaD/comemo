commit 0027dc91b05286d4fc3fc50a4802131881efd6e2
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    exp/template: simpler parse of char constants.
    We can avoid the check against empty constants (''),
    which UnquoteChar doesn't handle well, by leaving on
    the trailing quote and seeing that's all we have left at the end.
