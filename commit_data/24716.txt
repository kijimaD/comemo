    syscall: allow nacl's fake network code to Listen twice on the same address
    
    Noticed from nacl trybot failures on new tests in
    https://golang.org/cl/16630
    
    Related earlier fix of mine to nacl's listen code:
    
      syscall: fix nacl listener to not accept connections once closed
      https://go-review.googlesource.com/15940
    
    Perhaps a better fix (in the future?) would be to remove the listener
    from the map at close, but that didn't seem entirely straightforward
    last time I looked into it. It's not my code, but it seems that the
    map entry continues to have a purpose even after Listener close. (?)
    
    But given that this code is only really used for running tests and the
    playground, this seems fine.
