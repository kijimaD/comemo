    govet: check canonical dynamic method signatures
    
    Adds check that, for example, a Scan method taking
    a first argument of type fmt.ScanState has the correct
    signature to satisfy fmt.Scanner.
    
    Similarly, a ReadByte should return byte, os.Error.
    
    These are important to check because various pieces
    of code (fmt, gob, json, flate) do dynamic checks
    for these methods, so code with incorrect signatures
    would not be flagged at compile time.
    
    These become even more important to check when
    rune is introduced.
