    cmd/dist: produce intermedate .a files in a temporary location
    
    Before this change, the .a files for the intermediate go toolchains
    were produced in the same location as the install target. This change
    has them produced in a temporary location instead. This change,
    combined with go install not producing .a files for most stdlib
    packages by default results in a build of the distribution only
    producing .a's for the five packages in std that require cgo. (Before
    this change, the .a's for the final build were not being produced, but
    stale ones from the intermediate builds were left behind.)
    
    For #47257
