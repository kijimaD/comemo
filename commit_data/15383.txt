    cmd/vet: restructure to be package-driven
    This is a simple refactoring of main.go that will enable the type checker
    to be used during vetting.
    The change has an unimportant effect on the arguments: it now assumes
    that all files named explicitly on the command line belong to the same
    package. When run by the go command, this was true already.
    
    Also restore a missing parenthesis from an error message.
