    cmd/link: set the ELF headers of ARM executables that use cgo correctly
    
    It is generally expected that the ELF flags of a dynamically linked executable
    and the libraries it links against match. Go's linker currently always produces
    executables with flags that do not declare a float abi (hard, soft) at all, but
    when cgo is involved it is unlikely that this matches the system libraries
    being linked against -- really the decision about ABI is made by the C compiler
    during the invocation of cgo.
    
    This change is basically a port of the code from binutils that parses the
    ".ARM.attributes" section to check for the tag that declares that the code is
    built for the hard-float ABI.
    
    Fixes #7094
