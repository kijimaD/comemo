    exp/types/staging: test drivers
    
    This code has been reviewed before. The most significant
    change is to check_test which now can handle more than
    one error at the same error position (due to spurious
    errors - should not happen in praxis once error handling
    has been fine-tuned). This change makes check_test easier
    to use during development.
