    [dev.link] cmd/link: better naming for Loader container/subsym methods, part 1 of 2
    
    Introduce a new loader method "AddInteriorSym" to be used when
    establishing container/containee symbol relationships for host object
    sub-symbols and GOT/dynamic sub-symbols.
    
    Interior symbols are employed in situations where you have a
    "container" or "payload" symbol that has content, and then a series of
    "interior" sub-symbols that point into a portion of the container
    symbol's content. Each interior symbol will typically have a useful
    name / size / value, but no content of its own. From a symbol table
    perspective the container symbol is anonymous, but the interior
    symbols are added to the output symbol table.
