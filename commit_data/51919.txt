    all: upgrade Unicode from 13.0.0 to 15.0.0
    
    Update unicode/tables.go to reflect changes in the Unicode Standard up to
    Unicode 15.0.0, released 13 Sept 2022.
    
    In order to accommodate this update, strconv/isPrint has been updated to
    reflect changes in printable characters.
    
    Also changed is template/exec_test.go for both text and html packages- in
    the test "TestJSEscaping", rune U+FDFF was used as a placeholder for an
    unprintable character. This codepoint was assigned and made printable in
    Unicode 14.0.0, breaking this test. It has been replaced with the assigned
    and never-printable U+FFFE to fix the test and provide resiliency in the
    future.
    
    This upgrade bypasses Unicode 14.0.0, but is compatible.
