    runtime/trace: update outdated Task and Region documentation
    
    A previous iteration of the tracer's user annotation API had different
    names for tasks and regions, and used to return functions for ending
    them rather than types with End methods. This CL updates the doc
    comments to reflect those changes, and also fixes up the internal
    documentation of the events (similar to go.dev/cl/465335, the stack
    argument was in the wrong place in the list).
    
    The User Log event internal documentation might also look wrong since
    the value argument follows the stack argument. However, the User Log
    event is a special case where the log message is appended immediately
    following the normal event, including the stack argument. There isn't
    much room to clarify this next to the event type definitions, so this CL
    clarifies the comment where the event is encoded.
