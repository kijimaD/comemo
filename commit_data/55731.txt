    cmd/compile: fix early deadcode with label statement
    
    CL 517775 moved early deadcode into unified writer. with new way to
    handle dead code with label statement involved: any statements after
    terminating statement will be considered dead until next label
    statement.
    
    However, this is not safe, because code after label statement may still
    refer to dead statements between terminating and label statement.
    
    It's only safe to remove statements after terminating *and* label one.
    
    Fixes #65593
