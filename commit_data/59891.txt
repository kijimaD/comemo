    .github: simplify the telemetry proposal template
    
    Reduce the telemetry proposal template to make it easier to file
    telemetry proposals. At a high level, the proposal is just a request to
    merge a specific configuration change, so a free text rationale as well
    as proposed CL link should suffice. The proposal committee can make sure
    that all concerns about new uploading are addressed.
    
    Also, fix links to the chartconfig package documentation, as well as the
    config.txt file, and reference the new go.dev/doc/telemetry.
