    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of decl.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/decl.go
    and decl.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker and a minor comment
    update.
    
    The primary differences to go/types/decl.go are:
    - use of syntax rather than go/ast package
    - use of error_ objects to collect follow-on error info
    - use of check.conf.Trace rather than global trace flag
    - more aggressively marking variables as used in the presence errors
    - not using a walkDecl abstraction for const/var/type declarations
