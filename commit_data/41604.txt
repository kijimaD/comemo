    cmd/compile: improve CFG size in ssa.html
    
    This change forces CFGs to take the full width of their column
    and allows them to be as tall as necessary.
    
    In my (recent) experience, this makes them far less likely to
    be cropped, which makes them much more useful.
    
    On rare occasions, this can lead to gigantic CFGs,
    but if you've bothered to explicitly request a CFG,
    this is still better than an irrevocably truncated CFG.
