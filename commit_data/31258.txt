    testing: use function names to identify helpers
    
    Previously, helpers were identified by entry PC, but this breaks if the
    helper is inlined (as in notHelperCallingHelper). Instead, identify
    helpers by function name (with package path). Now TestTBHelper and
    TestTBHelperParallel pass with -l=4.
    
    To keep the code unified, this change makes it so that the runner
    is also identified by function name instead of entry PC.
