    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: adjust literal pool flush for span-dependent jump enlargement
    
    The current code delays the literal pool until the very last moment,
    but based on the assumption that span-dependent jumps are as
    short as possible. If they need to be enlarged in a later round, that
    very last moment may be too late. Flush a little early to prevent that.
    
    Fixes #13579.
