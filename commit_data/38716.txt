    cmd/vet: reenable cgo test
    
    The reason the 386 trybot was happy but 'GOARCH=386 go test cmd/vet'
    was not is that CgoEnabled defaults to false in a cross build;
    I have no idea why. Now we ask the go command for the effective
    value so that the test works in both cases.
    
    Also, remove stale comment.
    
    Fixes #28829
