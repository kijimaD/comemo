    json: preserve field name case by default
    
    This matches the old JSON package behavior.
    All lowercase names are not as standard as I believed,
    and it seems less surprising to need to write
    
            type T struct { Field string "field" }
    
    to get lower case (behavior after this CL) than it does to need
    to write
    
            type T struct { Field string "Field" }
    
    to preserve the case (behavior before this CL).
    
    Also test and  fix unmarshal into non-nil interface
    value or pointer.
    
    Fixes #744.
