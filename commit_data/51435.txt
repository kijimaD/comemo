    go/types, types2: better error reporting for Checker.implements
    
    This CL copies (and adjusts as needed) the logic for error reporting
    from operand.assignableTo to Checker.implements in the case of a missing
    method failure and assignment to an interface pointer.
    
    Preparation for using Checker.implements in operand.assignableTo
    rather than implementing the same logic twice.
    
    This also leads to better errors from Checker.implements as it's
    using the same logic we already use elsewhere.
    
    For #50646.
