    cmd/internal/obj/s390x: cleanup objz.go
    
    This CL deletes some unnecessary code in objz.go that existed to
    support instruction scheduling. It's likely instruction scheduling
    will never be done in this part of the backend so this code can
    just be deleted.
    
    This file can probably be cleaned up a bit more, but I think this
    is a good start.
    
    Passes: go build -toolexec 'toolstash -cmp' -a std.
