    runtime: signal forwarding
    
    Forward signals to signal handlers installed before Go installs its own,
    under certain circumstances.  In particular, as iant@ suggests, signals are
    forwarded iff:
       (1) a non-SIG_DFL signal handler existed before Go, and
       (2) signal is synchronous (i.e., one of SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE), and
            (3a) signal occured on a non-Go thread, or
            (3b) signal occurred on a Go thread but in CGo code.
    
    Supported only on Linux, for now.
