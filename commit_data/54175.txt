    cmd/go: refactor package references in Builder.build
    
    Refactor references to "a.Package" in Builder.build to be consistent,
    e.g. all via the "p" helper variable. No change in functionality, this
    is just intended to make the code more readable/consistent (since
    prior to this point we had a random mix of "p" and "a.Package").
