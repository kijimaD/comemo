    exp/ssh: fix unmarshal test
    
    Ensure that empty NameLists always return
    a zero length []string, not nil.
    
    In practice NameLists are only used in a few
    message types and always consumed by a for
    range function so the difference between nil
    and []string{} is not significant.
    
    Also, add exp/ssh to pkg/Makefile as suggested
    by rsc.
