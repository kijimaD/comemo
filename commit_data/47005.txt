    [dev.typeparams] go/types: adjust printing of embedded struct fields (fixes x/tools/cmd/guru tests)
    
    Prior to 1.16, go/types printed an embedded struct field by simply
    printing its type, which may have included a package qualification.
    Just printing the type is not useful with generic types and we now
    must print the actual field name derived from the type - this leads
    to different output for non-generic imported embedded types. Fix by
    printing a package qualification in that case.
