    misc/wasm: fix permissions on wasm_exec.js
    
    Currently wasm_exec.js is executable (0755) yet has no interpreter.
    Indeed wasm_exec.js is only ever used as an argument to Node or loaded
    via a <script> tag in a browser-loaded HTML file.  Hence the execute
    mode bits are superfluous and simply serve to clutter your PATH if
    $GOROOT/misc/wasm is on your PATH (as is required if you want to run go
    test syscall/js).
