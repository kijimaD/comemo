    cmd/dist: delete moved_goroot test
    
    This test is largely obviated by the goroot_executable and
    list_goroot_symlink cmd/go script tests. It's the last user of several
    special-case features in cmd/dist and runs only under a fairly
    constrained set of conditions (including only running on builders, not
    locally). Delete it.
