    all: use Go 1.17.13 for bootstrap
    
    Previously we used Go 1.17, but we realized thanks to tickling
    a pre-Go1.17.3 bug that if we are going to change the bootstrap
    toolchain that we should default to the latest available point release
    at the time we make the switch, not the initial major release, so as
    to avoid bugs that were fixed in the point releases.
    
    This CL updates the default search locations and the release notes.
    
    Users who run make.bash and depend on finding $HOME/sdk/go1.17
    may need to run
    
            go install golang.org/dl/go1.17.13@latest
            go1.17.13 download
    
    to provide a Go 1.17.13 toolchain to their builds.
