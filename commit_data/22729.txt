    runtime: report marked heap size in gctrace
    
    When the gctrace GODEBUG option is enabled, it will now report three
    heap sizes: the heap size at the beginning of the GC cycle, the heap
    size at the end of the GC cycle before sweeping, and marked heap size,
    which is the amount of heap that will be retained until the next GC
    cycle.
