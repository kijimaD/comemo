    io/fs: clarify additional File interface docs
    
    Emphasize ReadDirFile. It isn't really optional,
    and all filesystems have at least one directory (".").
    
    The remaining two additional interfaces are optimizations.
    Call them that.
    
    Fully qualify package package io identifiers.
