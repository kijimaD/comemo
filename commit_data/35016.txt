    crypto/x509: add test for asn1.Marshal of rsa.PublicKey
    
    Go 1.10 is adding new API MarshalPKCS1PublicKey and
    ParsePKCS1PublicKey for converting rsa.PublicKeys.
    
    Even though we'd prefer that users did not, check that
    if users call asn1.Marshal and asn1.Unmarshal directly instead,
    they get the same results. We know that code exists in the
    wild that depends on this.
