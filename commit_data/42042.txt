    cmd/go/internal/load: load imports for all package data errors
    
    go/build.Import can return errors for many different reasons like
    inconsistent package clauses or errors parsing build constraints.
    It will still return a *build.Package with imports from files it was
    able to process. Package.load should load these imports, even after an
    unknown error.
    
    There is already a special case for scanner.ErrorList (parse
    error). This CL expands that behavior for all errors.
    
    Fixes #38568
