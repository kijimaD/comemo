    cmd/compile/internal/gc: add dropped line correction again
    
    The line correction when reporting a missing package clause
    was removed before since it wasn't clear that it was needed.
    Added it again because of issue 13267.
    
    No explicit test case has been added to test/fixedbugs because
    it would require a file that contains a single byte and such a
    file doesn't fit the existing test harness. Instead documented
    the problematic line in the parser for future reference.
    
    Fixes #13267.
