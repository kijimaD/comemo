    net/http: error if Transport.Proxy returns https
    
    Transport.Proxy is documented as only supporting the http and socks5
    schemes. If one tries to use it for https URLs, they end up with a
    cryptic error like:
    
            http: TLS handshake error from [...]: tls: oversized record received with length 20037
    
    This is because Transport simply skips TLS if Proxy is non-nil, since it
    knows it doesn't support Proxy with https.
    
    However, that error is very confusing and it can take a while to figure
    out what's going on. Instead, error if Proxy is used and it returns an
    unsupported scheme.
    
    Updates #19493.
