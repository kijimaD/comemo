    net/http: roll back "clean the path of the stripped URL by StripPrefix"
    
    Roll back CL 161738. That fix changed StripPrefix behavior in the
    general case, not just in the situation where where stripping the
    prefix from path resulted in the empty string, causing issue #31622.
    
    That kind of change to StripPrefix behavior is not backwards compatible,
    and there can be a smaller, more targeted fix for the original issue.
    
    Fixes #31622
    Updates #30165
