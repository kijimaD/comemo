    runtime: eliminate arbitrary timeout in TestCgoLockOSThreadExit
    
    This test previously failed if running a new pthread took longer than
    a hard-coded 100ms. On some slow or heavily-loaded builders, that
    scheduling latency is too short.
    
    Since the point of this test is to verify that the background thread
    is not reused after it terminates (see #20395), the arbitrary time
    limit does not seem helpful: if the background thread fails to
    terminate the test will time out on its own, and if the main goroutine
    is scheduled on the background thread the test will fail regardless of
    how long it takes.
    
    Fixes #58247.
