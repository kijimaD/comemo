    cmd/link: better fix for arm32 trampgen problem with duff routines
    
    This patch provides a fix for a problem linking large arm32 binaries
    with external linking, specifically R_CALLARM relocations against
    runtime.duff* routines being flagged by the external linker as not
    reaching.
    
    What appears to be happening in the bug in question is that the Go
    linker and the external linker are using slightly different recipes to
    decide whether a given R_CALLARM relocation will "fit" (e.g. will not
    require a trampoline). The Go linker is taking into account the addend
    on the call reloc (which for calls to runtime.duffcopy or
    runtime.duffzero is nonzero), whereas the external linker appears to
    be ignoring the addend.
    
    Example to illustrate:
    
       Addr      Size   Func
       -----     -----  -----
       ...
       XYZ       1024   runtime.duffcopy
       ...
       ABC       ...    mypackge.MyFunc
         + R0: R_CALLARM  o=8 a=848 tgt=runtime.duffcopy<0>
    
    Let's say that the distance between ABC (start address of
    runtime.duffcopy) and XYZ (start of MyFunc) is just over the
    architected 24-bit maximum displacement for an R_CALLARM (let's say
    that ABC-XYZ is just over the architected limit by some small value,
    say 36). Because we're calling into runtime.duffcopy at offset 848,
    however, the relocation does in fact fit, but if the external linker
    isn't taking into account the addend (assuming that all calls target
    the first instruction of the called routine), then we'll get a
    "doesn't fit" error from the linker.
    
    To work around this problem, revise the ARM trampoline generation code
    in the Go linker that computes the trampoline threshold to ignore the
    addend on R_CALLARM relocations, so as to harmonize the two linkers.
