commit 2d4f7ba0cd65dfd9b47b3641f24b759c627c9433

    printf as we know and love it.
    
    Plus print[ln] with the ability to print struct values.
    
    Note for language mavens: if a "..." function passes its argument
    to another "..." function, the argument is not wrapped again.  This
    allows printf to call fprintf without extra manipulation. It's good
    but needs to go in the spec.
    
    This code works:
    ///
    package main
    
    import fmt "fmt"
    import os "os"
    
    type T struct { s string; a, b int }
    
    func main() {
            P := fmt.Printer();
            P.printf("%s = %d with float value %.4f\n", "hi there", 7, 123.456);
            P.println("hi there", 7, 123.456);
            P.fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s = %d with float value %.4f\n", "hi there", 7, 123.456);
            P.println(T{"x", 7, 234}, "end of struct", 8, 9);
    }
