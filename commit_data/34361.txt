    go/types: type-check embedded methods in correct scope (regression)
    
    Change https://go-review.googlesource.com/79575 fixed the computation
    of recursive method sets by separating the method set computation from
    type computation. However, it didn't track an embedded method's scope
    and as a result, some methods' signatures were typed in the wrong
    context.
    
    This change tracks embedded methods together with their scope and
    uses that scope for the correct context setup when typing those
    method signatures.
    
    Fixes #23914.
