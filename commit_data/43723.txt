    cmd/internal: allow ADDE to work with memory location on s390x
    
    Originally on s390x, ADDE does not work when adding numbers from a memory location.
    For example: ADDE (R3), R4 will result in a failure.
    
    Since ADDC, ADD and ADDW already supports adding from memory location,
    let's support that for ADDE as well.
