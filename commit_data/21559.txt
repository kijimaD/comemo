    build: androidtest.bash has to use copy for files to adb-sync.
    
    androidtest.bash copies some go source to the android device
    where the tests are going to run. It's necessary because some
    tests require files and resources to be present. The copy is
    done through adb sync. The script hoped faking the directory
    using symlinks to work, but it doesn't. (adb sync doesn't follow
    the symlinks) We need proper copy.
