    go/internal/gccgoimporter: fix test when using gccgo 4.7
    
    TestInstallationImporter checks that it can read the export data for a
    list of known standard library packages. It was failing on the SmartOS
    builder which has GCC 4.7 installed. Skip packages that did not exist
    in GCC 4.7. Most packages are still there and the missing packages are
    fairly simple, so this doesn't really affect test quality.
    
    Updates #29006
