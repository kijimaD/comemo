    net/url: make URL implement encoding.BinaryMarshaler, BinaryUnmarshaler
    
    This makes it possible to use URLs with gob.
    
    Ideally we'd also implement TextMarshaler and TextUnmarshaler,
    but that would change the JSON encoding of a URL from something like:
    
            {"Scheme":"https","Opaque":"","User":null,"Host":"www.google.com","Path":"/x","RawPath":"","ForceQuery":false,"RawQuery":"y=z","Fragment":""}
    
    to something like:
    
            "https://www.google.com/x?y=z"
    
    That'd be nice, but it would break code expecting the old form.
    
    Fixes #10964.
