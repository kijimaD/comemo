commit 146713b67ac6628350abd74f76fd2955de66b3c6

    go/format, cmd/gofmt: added missing comments, minor internal cleanup
    
    This is a minor cleanup following CL 142360043:
    
    The internal parse and format functions in both packages
    were almost identical - made them identical by adding an
    extra parameter, and documented them as identical.
    
    Eventually we should find a nice way to factor these functions
    out, but we cannot do this now while in prep for 1.4.
    
    No functionality change.
