    misc/cgo/test: fix issue 24161 test for 1.11 and earlier
    
    The test uses functions from C that were introduced in OSX 1.12.
    Include stubs for those functions when compiling for 1.11 and earlier.
    This test really a compile-time test, it doesn't matter much what the
    executed code actually does.
    Use a nasty #define hack to work around the fact that cgo doesn't
    support static global variables.
    
    Update #24161
    Fixes #26355
