    spec: remove superfluous terms "delimiter" and "special tokens"
    
    The (original) section on "Operators and Delimiters" introduced
    superfluous terminology ("delimiter", "special token") which
    didn't matter and was used inconsistently.
    
    Removed any mention of "delimiter" or "special token" and now
    simply group the special character tokens into "operators"
    (clearly defined via links), and "punctuation" (everything else).
    
    Fixes #19450.
