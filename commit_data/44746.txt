    net/http: make ExampleGet show StatusCode checks for non-1XX,2XX responses
    
    Updates ExampleGet to show how to handle bad responses with non-1XX,2XX
    status codes. Given that the canonical examples are copied, we need
    to have them properly check against failures. This is a bug I've seen
    often in the wild, that's exacerbated when for example unmarshalling
    JSON or even protobufs, and no errors are returned by the decoders,
    so code fails silently after making a request for example to a gateway
    that they were unauthorized to access.
    
    Fixes #39778
