    runtime: disable GC around TestGoroutineParallelism
    
    TestGoroutineParallelism can deadlock if the GC runs during the
    test. Currently it tries to prevent this by forcing a GC before the
    test, but this is best effort and fails completely if GOGC is very low
    for testing.
    
    This change replaces this best-effort fix with simply setting GOGC to
    off for the duration of the test.
