    cmd/go: set buildmode=pie default for android/arm64.
    
    Just like android/arm, android/arm64 refuses to execute non-PIE
    binaries. In addition, starting from the M release (Marshmallow),
    Android refuses to execute binaries with any text relocations
    (this was just a warning in the L release). This makes "-shared"
    necessary as well when building executables for Android.
