    doc: mark range-over-func as documented
    
    The language change for the accepted range-over-func proposal #61405
    was documented in CL 590616. Remove the corresponding 'TODO' entry.
    
    Also improve formatting slightly, and switch to preferred relative
    links. They'll work better in the long term and in more contexts.
    
    While here, also simplify the suggested line to preview release notes
    locally: setting the -content='' flag explicitly is no longer required
    as of CL 589936.
    
    For #65614.
