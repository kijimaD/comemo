    crypto/tls: implement TLS 1.3 version-specific messages
    
    Note that there is significant code duplication due to extensions with
    the same format appearing in different messages in TLS 1.3. This will be
    cleaned up in a future refactor once CL 145317 is merged.
    
    Enforcing the presence/absence of each extension in each message is left
    to the upper layer, based on both protocol version and extensions
    advertised in CH and CR. Duplicated extensions and unknown extensions in
    SH, EE, HRR, and CT will be tightened up in a future CL.
    
    The TLS 1.2 CertificateStatus message was restricted to accepting only
    type OCSP as any other type (none of which are specified so far) would
    have to be negotiated.
    
    Updates #9671
