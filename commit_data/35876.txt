    cmd/go: add ForceLibrary to build hash
    
    When a command has a test that is not in package main, the main
    package is built as a library, with ForceLibrary set. It can of course
    also be built as an ordinary main package. If we don't record that fact
    in the hash, then both variants of the command will use the same hash,
    which causes a GODEBUG=gocacheverify=1 failure. It also seems unsafe
    although it's not clear to me whether it can cause an actual failure.
    
    Along with CL 121941,
    Fixes #25666
