    cmd/compile: fix duplicate code generation in swt.go
    
    When combining adjacent type switch cases with the same type hash, we
    failed to actually remove the combined cases, so we would generate
    code for them twice.
    
    We use MD5 for type hashes, so collisions are rare, but they do
    currently appear in test/fixedbugs/bug248.dir/bug2.go, which is how I
    noticed this failure.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
