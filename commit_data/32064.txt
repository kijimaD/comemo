    time: test and fix Time.Round, Duration.Round for d > 2⁶²
    
    Round uses r+r < d to decide whether the remainder is
    above or below half of d (to decide whether to round up or down).
    This is wrong when r+r wraps negative, because it looks < d
    but is really > d.
    
    No one will ever care about rounding to a multiple of
    d > 2⁶² (about 146 years), but might as well get it right.
    
    Fixes #19807.
