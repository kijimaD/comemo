    runtime: don't call libc sigaction function in forked child
    
    If we are using vfork, and if something (such as TSAN) is intercepting
    the sigaction function, then we must call the system call, not the
    libc function. Otherwise the intercepted sigaction call in the child
    may trash the data structures in the parent.
