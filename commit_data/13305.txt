    test/bench/go1: add go/parser benchmark
    
    As discussed in
    
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/Na9XE6mcQyY/zbeBI7R-vnoJ
    
    Here is a static copy of the go/parser benchmark. I ended up using
    fancy encodings because the original parser.go had a number of `s
    scattered throughout which made it hard to embed the source directly.
    
    Curiously on my laptop this benchmark always scores roughly 10% higher
    than the standalone benchmark. This may be down to the generation of
    the fasta data set triggering the cpu governor to raise the cpu speed.
    However the benchmark is consistent with itself across multiple runs.
