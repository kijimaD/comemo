    compress/flate: improve short writer error test
    
    This improves the short version of the writer test.
    
    First of all, it has a much quicker setup. Previously that
    could take up towards 0.5 second.
    
    Secondly, it will test all compression levels in short mode as well.
    
    Execution time is 1.7s/0.03s for normal/short mode.
