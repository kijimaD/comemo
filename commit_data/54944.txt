    spec: document that trailing comma is valid after index in index expressions
    
    At parse time we don't know if a[i] is an index expression or a
    type (or function) instantiation. Because instantiations accept
    a list of type arguments, and argument lists permit a trailing
    comma, a[i,] is either an instantiation or index expression.
    
    Document that a trailing comma is permitted in the syntax for
    index expressions.
    
    For comparison, the same problem arises with conversions which
    cannot be distinguished from function calls at parse time. The
    spec also permits a trailing comma for conversions T(x,). The
    grammar adjustment is the same (see line 5239).
    
    Fixes #55007.
