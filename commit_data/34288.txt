    crypto/tls: replace signatureAndHash by SignatureScheme.
    
    Consolidate the signature and hash fields (SignatureAndHashAlgorithm in
    TLS 1.2) into a single uint16 (SignatureScheme in TLS 1.3 draft 21).
    This makes it easier to add RSASSA-PSS for TLS 1.2 in the future.
    
    Fields were named like "signatureAlgorithm" rather than
    "signatureScheme" since that name is also used throughout the 1.3 draft.
    
    The only new public symbol is ECDSAWithSHA1, other than that this is an
    internal change with no new functionality.
