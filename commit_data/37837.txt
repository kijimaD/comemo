    crypto/x509: ignore harmless edge case in TestSystemRoots
    
    The no-cgo validation hack lets in certificates from the root store that
    are not marked as roots themselves, but are signed by a root; the cgo
    path correctly excludes them. When TestSystemRoots compares cgo and
    no-cgo results it tries to ignore them by ignoring certificates which
    pass validation, but expired certificates were failing validation.
    
    Letting through expired certs is harmless anyway because we will refuse
    to build chains to them.
    
    Fixes #29497
