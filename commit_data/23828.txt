    go/build: update deps list
    
    A while back we discovered that the dependencies test allowed
    arbitrary dependencies for packages we forgot to list.
    To stop the damage we added a grandfathered list and fixed
    the code to expect unlisted packages to have no dependencies.
    
    This CL replaces the grandfathered list with some more
    careful placement of dependency rules.
    
    Thankfully, there were no terrible inversions.
    
    Fixes #10487.
