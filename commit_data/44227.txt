    go/build: move build constraint docs to 'go help buildconstraint'
    
    CL 228017 added a new help page 'go help buildconstraint' which
    summarized the information on build constraints in the go/build
    documentation. The summary was almost as long as the go/build
    documentation, since there's very little that can be left out.
    
    This CL moves the original go/build documentation to
    'go help buildconstraint' to eliminate redundnancy. The text
    describing enabled tags is slightly different (targeting command-line
    users more than go/build users), but the rest of the documentation is
    unchanged.
    
    Fixes #37018
