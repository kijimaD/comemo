    runtime: setg after sigFetchG
    
    In the normal case, sigFetchG just returns the G register. But in
    the case that sigFetchG fetches the G from somewhere else, the G
    register still holding an invalid value. Setg here to make sure
    they match.
    
    This is particularly useful because setGsignalStack, called by
    adjustSignalStack from sigtrampgo before setg to gsignal,
    accesses the G register.
    
    Should fix #35249.
