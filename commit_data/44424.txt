    cmd/compile: fix mishandling of unsafe-uintptr arguments with call method in go/defer
    
    In CL 253457, we did the same fix for direct function calls. But for
    method calls, the receiver argument also need to be passed through the
    wrapper function, which we are not doing so the compiler crashes with
    the code in #44415.
    
    As we already rewrite t.M(...) into T.M(t, ...) during walkCall1, to fix
    this, we can do the same trick in wrapCall, so the receiver argument
    will be treated as others.
    
    Fixes #44415
