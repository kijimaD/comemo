    misc/cgo/testcshared: use fd 100 instead of fd 10 for back-channel communication
    
    There is a report that fd 10 is already in use when run on some OS X machines.
    I don't see how, and I can't reproduce the problem on my own OS X machine,
    but it's easy enough to fix.
    
    Fixes #12161.
