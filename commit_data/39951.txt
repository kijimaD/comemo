    regexp: add more examples for Regexp methods
    
    Since I first started on this CL, most of the methods have had examples
    added by other folks, so this is now one new example, and additions to
    two existing examples for extra clarity.
    
    The issue has a comment about not necessarily having examples for all
    methods, but I recall finding this package pretty confusing when I first
    used it, and having concrete examples would have really helped me
    navigate all the different options. There are more
    String methods with examples now, but I think seeing how the byte-slice
    methods work could also be helpful to explain the differences.
    
    Updates #21450
