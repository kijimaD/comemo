    cmd/trace/v2: add support for goroutine filtering
    
    This change adds support for the trace?goid=<goid> endpoint to the trace
    tool for v2 traces.
    
    In effect, this change actually implements a per-goroutine view. I tried
    to add a link to the main page to enable a "view by goroutines" view
    without filtering, but the web trace viewer broke the browser tab when
    there were a few hundred goroutines. The risk of a browser hang probably
    isn't worth the cases where this is nice, especially since filtering by
    goroutine already works. Unfortunate, but c'est l'vie. Might be worth
    revisiting if we change out the web viewer in the future.
    
    For #60773.
    For #63960.
