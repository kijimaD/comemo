    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: fix ICE during ir.Dump
    
    fmt.go:dumpNodeHeader uses reflection to call all "func() bool"-typed
    methods on Nodes during printing, but the OnStack method that I added
    in CL 283233 isn't meant to be called on non-variables.
    
    dumpNodeHeader does already guard against panics, as happen in some
    other accessors, but not against Fatalf, as I was using in OnStack. So
    simply change OnStack to use panic too.
    
    Thanks to drchase@ for the report.
