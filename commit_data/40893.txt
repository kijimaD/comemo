    misc: remove use of relative directories in overlayDir functions
    
    It turns out that the relative-path support never worked in the first
    place.
    
    It had been masked by the fact that we ~never invoke overlayDir with
    an absolute path, which caused filepath.Rel to always return an error,
    and overlayDir to always fall back to absolute paths.
    
    Since the absolute paths seem to be working fine (and are simpler),
    let's stick with those. As far as I can recall, the relative paths
    were only a space optimization anyway.
