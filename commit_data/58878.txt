    runtime: ensure we free unrolled GC bitmaps
    
    CL 555355 has a bug in it - the GC program flag was also used to decide
    when to free the unrolled bitmap. After that CL, we just don't free any
    unrolled bitmaps, leading to a memory leak.
    
    Use a separate flag to track types that need to be freed when their
    corresponding object is freed.
