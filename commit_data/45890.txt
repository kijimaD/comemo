    path/filepath: deflake TestEvalSymlinksAboveRoot on darwin
    
    On darwin, under load, it appears that the system occasionally
    deletes the temp dir mid-test. Don't fail the test when that happens.
    
    It would be nice to fix this in a deeper way.
    See golang.org/cl/332009 for some discussion.
    
    In the meantime, this will at least stop the flakiness.
