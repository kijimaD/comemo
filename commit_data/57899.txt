    image/jpeg: initialize dct_test constants at compile time
    
    Doing so is slightly more accurate than calculating at run time (because
    of float64 rounding errors): https://go.dev/play/p/hrOzHDLjd5K
    
    Having these more accurate values isn't necessary for tests to pass, but
    it's helpful if doing printf-debugging or stepping through the code.
