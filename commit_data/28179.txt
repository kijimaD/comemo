    runtime: improve message when a bad pointer is found on the stack
    
    Currently this message says "invalid stack pointer", which could be
    interpreted as the value of SP being invalid. Change it to "invalid
    pointer found on stack" to emphasize that it's a pointer on the stack
    that's invalid.
    
    Updates #16948.
