    crypto/rsa,crypto/ecdsa,crypto/ed25519: implement PublicKey.Equal
    
    This makes all modern public keys in the standard library implement a
    common interface (below) that can be used by applications for better
    type safety and allows for checking that public (and private keys via
    Public()) are equivalent.
    
    interface {
        Equal(crypto.PublicKey) bool
    }
    
    Equality for ECDSA keys is complicated, we take a strict interpretation
    that works for all secure applications (the ones not using the
    unfortunate non-constant time CurveParams implementation) and fails
    closed otherwise.
    
    Tests in separate files to make them x_tests and avoid an import loop
    with crypto/x509.
    
    Fixes #21704
