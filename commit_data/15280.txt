    cmd/go: reject case-insensitive file name, import collisions
    
    To make sure that Go code will work when moved to a
    system with a case-insensitive file system, like OS X or Windows,
    reject any package built from files with names differing
    only in case, and also any package built from imported
    dependencies with names differing only in case.
    
    Fixes #4773.
