    os/user: Current support on Plan 9
    
    Current for Plan 9 is implemented with /dev/user for
    Uid/Gid/Username/Name, and $home environment variable for
    HomeDir.
    
    Implementing Lookup/LookupId is not done, which would
    require parsing /adm/users. It is unclear of how much benefit
    this would be.
