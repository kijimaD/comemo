-Why does the project use Mercurial and not git?</h3>
-
-<p>
-The Go project, hosted by Google Code at
-<a href="//code.google.com/p/go">code.google.com/p/go</a>,
-uses Mercurial as its version control system.
-When the project launched,
-Google Code supported only Subversion and Mercurial.
-Mercurial was a better choice because of its plugin mechanism
-that allowed us to create the "codereview" plugin to connect
-the project to the excellent code review tools at
-<a href="//codereview.appspot.com">codereview.appspot.com</a>.
-</p>

-<p>
-Programmers who work
-with the Go project's source rather than release downloads sometimes
-ask for the project to switch to git.
-That would be possible, but it would be a lot of work and
-would also require reimplementing the codereview plugin.
-Given that Mercurial works today, with code review support,
-combined with the Go project's mostly linear, non-branching use of
-version control, a switch to git doesn't seem worthwhile.
