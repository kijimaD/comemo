    syscall: do not overflow key memory in GetQueuedCompletionStatus
    
    The third argument to GetQueuedCompletionStatus is a pointer to a
    uintptr, not a uint32. Users of this functions have therefore been
    corrupting their memory every time they used it. Either that memory
    corruption was silent (dangerous), or their programs didn't work so they
    chose a different API to use.
    
    Fixes #44538.
