    Revert "cmd/go: fix the default build output name for versioned binaries"
    
    This reverts CL 140863 (commit bf94fc3ae387fc09929443393741919fac6727af).
    
    Reason for revert: There was a potential problem spotted in the original
    fix, which resulted in it being rolled back from release-branch.go1.12
    and not included in Go 1.12.1 release. We intend to improve the fix and
    include it in Go 1.12.2 instead. To make the fix easier to backport,
    revert this change before re-applying the improved fix (next commit).
