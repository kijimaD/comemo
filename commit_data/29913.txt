    runtime: update big mgc.go comment
    
    The comment describing the overall GC algorithm at the top of mgc.go
    has gotten woefully out-of-date (and was possibly never
    correct/complete). Update it to reflect the current workings of the
    GC and the set of phases that we now divide it into.
