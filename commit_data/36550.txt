    go/types: remove explicit path parameter from most type-checker functions (cleanup)
    
    Now that most of the type-checker is using the object-coloring mechanism
    to detect cycles, remove the explicit path parameter from the functions
    that don't rely on it anymore.
    
    Some of the syntactic-based resolver code (for aliases, interfaces)
    still use an explicit path; leaving those unchanged for now.
    
    The function cycle was moved from typexpr.go (where it is not used
    anymore) to resolver.go (where it's still used). It has not changed.
    
    Fixes #25773.
