    runtime: ignore sigaction error on Linux if it is for SIGRTMAX
    
    The Go runtime registers a handler for every signal. This prevents Go
    binaries from working on QEMU in user-emulation mode, since the hacky
    way QEMU implements signals on Linux assumes that no-one uses signal
    64 (SIGRTMAX).
    
    In the past, we had a workaround in the runtime to prevent crashes on
    start-up when running on QEMU:
    
      golang.org/cl/124900043
      golang.org/cl/16853
    
    but it went lost during the 1.11 dev cycle. More precisely, the test
    for SIGRTMAX was dropped in CL 18150 when we stopped testing the
    result of sigaction in the Linux implementation of setsig. That change
    was made to avoid a stack split overflow because code started calling
    setsig from nosplit functions. Then in CL 99077 we started testing the
    result of sigaction again, this time using systemstack to avoid to
    stack split overflow. When this test was added back, we did not bring
    back the test of SIGRTMAX.
    
    As a result, Go1.10 binaries work on QEMU, while 1.11 binaries
    immediately crash on startup.
    
    This change restores the QEMU workaround.
