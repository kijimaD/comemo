    cmd/asm/internal/asm: add extra AVX-512 tests
    
    These tests were meant to be included into https://golang.org/cl/113315,
    but were lost somewhere in the middle.
    
    This CL adds hand-written AVX-512 tests that complement
    auto-generated test suite.
    
    It's worth including it, because:
    
            - It covers every new Z-case explicitly
            - Does checks every opcode suffix encoding
