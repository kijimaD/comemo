    cmd/compile: renovate GOSSAHASH
    
    Randomized feature enable/disable might be something we use to
    help users debug any problems with changed loop variable capture,
    and there's another CL that would like to use it to help in
    locating places where "fused" multiply add instructions change
    program behavior.
    
    This CL:
    - adds the ability to include an integer parameter (e.g. line number)
    - replumbed the environment variable into a flag to simplify go build cache management
    - but added an environment variable to allow flag setting through the environment
    - which adds the possibility of switching on a different variable
      (if there's one built-in for variable capture, it shouldn't be GOSSAHASH)
    - cleaned up the checking code
    - adds tests for all the intended behavior
    - removes the case for GSHS_LOGFILE; TBD whether we'll need to put that back
      or if there is another way.
