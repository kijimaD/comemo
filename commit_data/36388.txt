    encoding/json: defer error context work until necessary
    
    Calling Name on a reflect.Type is somewhat expensive, as it involves a
    number of nested calls and string handling.
    
    This cost was showing up when decoding structs, as we were calling it to
    set up an error context.
    
    We can avoid the extra work unless we do encounter an error, which makes
    decoding via struct types faster.
