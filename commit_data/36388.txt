    cmd/vet: use type information in isLocalType
    
    Now that vet always has type information, there's no reason to use
    string handling on type names to gather information about them, such as
    whether or not they are a local type.
    
    The semantics remain the same - the only difference should be that the
    implementation is less fragile and simpler.
