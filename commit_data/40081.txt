    cmd/compile: enable -newescape by default
    
    RELNOTE=yes
    
    The new escape analysis pass is more precise, which for most Go code
    should be an improvement. However, it may also break code that
    happened to work before (e.g., code that violated the unsafe.Pointer
    safety rules).
    
    The old escape analysis pass can be re-enabled with "go build
    -gcflags=all=-newescape=false". N.B., it's NOT recommended to mix the
    old and new escape analysis passes such as by omitting "all=". While
    the old and new escape analysis passes use similar and mostly
    compatible metadata, there are cases (e.g., closure handling) where
    they semantically differ and could lead to memory corruption errors in
    compiled programs.
    
    Fixes #23109.
