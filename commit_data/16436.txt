    cmd/5a, cmd/dist, runtime: support m/g in the assembler, drop support for R9/R10
    to avoid unintentionally clobber R9/R10.
    Thanks Lucio for the suggestion.
    
    PS: yes, this could be considered a big change (but not an API change), but
    as it turns out even temporarily changes R9/R10 in user code is unsafe and
    leads to very hard to diagnose problems later, better to disable using R9/R10
    when the user first uses it.
    See CL 6300043 and CL 6305100 for two problems caused by misusing R9/R10.
