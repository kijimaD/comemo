    cmd/internal/obj/arm: make assembler concurrency-safe
    
    Move global state from obj.Link
    to a new function-local state struct arm.ctxt5.
    
    This ends up being cleaner than threading
    all the state through as parameters; there's a lot of it.
    While we're here, move newprog from a parameter to ctxt5.
    
    We reserve the variable name c for ctxt5,
    so a few local variables named c have been renamed.
    
    Instead of lazily initializing deferreturn
    and Sym_div and friends, initialize them up front.
    
    Passes toolstash-check -all.
    
    Updates #15756
