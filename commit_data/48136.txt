    spec: move all sections describing type properties into one place
    
    This change only shuffles sections for better organization; there
    are no other changes except title and link adjustments.
    
    Until now, the sections on underlying types and method sets were
    immediately following the introduction of types. As it becomes
    necessary to introduce the notion of a core type more centrally,
    the natural place is immediately following the section on underlying
    types. All together, these sections, immediately after the introduction
    of types, would distract from purpose of the section on types, which
    is to introduce the various types that Go offers.
    
    The more natural place for the definition of underlying, core, and
    specific types is the section on properties of types and values.
    
    To accomplish this, the section on the structure of interfaces is
    split into a section on core types and one on specific types, and
    the various sections are reorganized appropriately.
    
    The new organization of the section on types now simply introduces
    all Go types as follows:
    
    - boolean types
    - numeric types
    - string types
    - array types
    - slice types
    - struct types
    - pointer types
    - function types
    - interface types
    - map types
    - channel types
    - type parameters
    
    The new organization of the section on properties of types and values
    is as follows:
    
    - underlying types
    - core types
    - specific types
    - type identity
    - assignability
    - representability
    - method sets
