    runtime: move checknocurrentwbuf() from scanblock to drainworkbuf
    
    Previously, scanblock called checknocurrentwbuf() after
    drainworkbuf().  Move this call into drainworkbuf so that every return
    path from drainworkbuf calls checknocurrentwbuf().  This is equivalent
    to the previous code because scanblock was the only caller of
    drainworkbuf.
