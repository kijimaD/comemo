    runtime: increase nosplit area to 192
    
    In CL 131450043, which raised it to 160,
    I'd raise it to 192 if necessary.
    Apparently it is necessary on windows/amd64.
    
    One note for those concerned about the growth:
    in the old segmented stack world, we wasted this much
    space at the bottom of every stack segment.
    In the new contiguous stack world, each goroutine has
    only one stack segment, so we only waste this much space
    once per goroutine. So even raising the limit further might
    still be a net savings.
    
    Fixes windows/amd64 build.
