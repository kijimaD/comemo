    cmd/compile: do not skip TestFormats on short builders
    
    TestFormats adds ~3s of running time to the test, which may be
    slightly annoying in an edit/compile/test cycle but is negligible in a
    TryBot run.
    
    The test keeps regressing in the longtest builders, requiring a manual
    fix. Instead, run it even in short mode on the builders, so that
    TryBot runs will detect regressions ahead of time.
