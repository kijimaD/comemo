    Revert "io: allocate copy buffers from a pool"
    
    This reverts CL 456555.
    
    Reason for revert: This seems too likely to exercise race conditions
    in code where a Write call continues to access its buffer after
    returning. The HTTP/2 ResponseWriter is one such example.
    
    Reverting this change while we think about this some more.
    
    For #57202
