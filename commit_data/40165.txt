    runtime: randomize package initialization order in race mode
    
    This is one small step to force people to not depend on the order of
    initialization of packages which are not explicitly ordered by import
    directives. Similar to randomizing map iteration order, this makes
    sure people aren't depending on the behavior of the current release,
    so that we can change the order in future releases without breaking
    everyone.
    
    Maybe one day we can randomize always, but for now we do it just in
    race mode. (We would need to measure the impact on startup time before
    we enabled it always.)
    
    RELNOTE=yes
