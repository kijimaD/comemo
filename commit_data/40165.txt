    runtime: do not omit stack trace of goroutine that handles async events
    
    On wasm there is a special goroutine that handles asynchronous events.
    Blocking this goroutine often causes a deadlock. However, the stack
    trace of this goroutine was omitted when printing the deadlock error.
    
    This change adds an exception so the goroutine is not considered as
    an internal system goroutine and the stack trace gets printed, which
    helps with debugging the deadlock.
    
    Updates #32764
