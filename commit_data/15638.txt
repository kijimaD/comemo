    net/http: Transport socket late binding
    
    Implement what Chrome calls socket "late binding". See:
    https://insouciant.org/tech/connection-management-in-chromium/
    
    In a nutshell, if our HTTP client needs a TCP connection to a
    remote host and there's not an idle one available, rather than
    kick off a dial and wait for that specific dial, we instead
    kick off a dial and wait for either our own dial to finish, or
    any other TCP connection to that same host to become
    available.
    
    The implementation looks like a classic "Learning Go
    Concurrency" slide.
