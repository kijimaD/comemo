commit 41a23ca08ba1187c64226e9f114d2c2f521bd3fb
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 28 20:47:52 2011 -0800

    goyacc: clarify it's package, not binary, that has
    conflict and explain that you could put the grammars
    in separate packages instead.
    
    I could be talked into rolling back the previous change
    and just making a doc change instead, but I'm content
    to let it stand.
