    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: don't issue nops for static data
    
    It confuses live variable analysis to have a bunch of unreachable
    no-ops at the end of a function.  Symptom is:
        gc/plive.go:483 panic: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not *gc.BasicBlock
    
    I don't see any reason why the old compiler needs these no-ops either.
    all.bash passes with the equivalent code removed on master.
