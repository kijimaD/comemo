    io: fix infinite loop bug in MultiReader
    
    If an io.Reader returned (non-zero, EOF), MultiReader would yield
    bytes forever.
    
    This bug has existed before Go 1 (!!), introduced in the original
    MultiReader implementation in https://golang.org/cl/1764043 and also
    survived basically the only update to this code since then
    (https://golang.org/cl/17873, git rev ccdca832c), which was added in
    Go 1.7.
    
    This just bit me when writing a test for some unrelated code.
    
    Fixes #16795
