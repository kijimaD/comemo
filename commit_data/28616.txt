    crypto/ecdsa: correct code comment.
    
    The code comment mixed up max and min. In this case, min is correct
    because this entropy is only used to make the signature scheme
    probabilistic. (I.e. if it were fixed then the scheme would still be
    secure except that key.Sign(foo) would always give the same result for a
    fixed key and foo.)
    
    For this purpose, 256-bits is plenty.
    
    Fixes #16819.
