    cmd/go: work around race in fmtCmd
    
    CL 529219 made an existing race with accessing Builder.scriptDir from
    Builder.fmtcmd (and now also Builder.Showcmd) much more likely by
    dropping a theoretically unnecessary condition from the call from
    Builder.run to Builder.fmtcmd.
    
    For an example race report, see
    https://build.golang.org/log/c3cad62d0fc33a8381d2091661c685ea1fc525c4
    
    The race is between
    
      (*Builder).cover2() -> (*Builder).run() -> (*Builder).fmtcmd()
    
    and various other call paths of the form
    
      (*Builder).build() -> (*gcToolchain).*  (*Builder).Showcmd() -> (*Builder).fmtcmd()
    
    The race can be reproduced with
    
      go install -race cmd/go
      stress -p 1 go test -x -cover -a log
    
    Return this race to its existing likelihood by putting the condition
    back. This isn't a "correct" solution because the race could still
    happen if the "cover" tool invoked by Builder.cover2 emits output. But
    this will do for a temporary fix.
