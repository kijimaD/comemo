commit 7763345379bb5520c8571661e4f095c937545ee9
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 20 11:50:11 2009 -0800

    Support for basic try-catch style exception handling.
    Meant as illustration of the Go pattern that is using
    goroutines and channels to handle exceptional situations.
    
    Note: There is no need for "Finally" since the
    "try block" (the function f supplied to Try)
    cannot do a Smalltalk-style non-local return
    and terminate the function surrounding Try.
    
    Replaces CL 157083.
