    runtime: make windows exception handler code arch independent
    
    Mainly it is simple copy. But I had to change amd64
    lastcontinuehandler return value from uint32 to int32.
    I don't remember how it happened to be uint32, but new
    int32 is matching better with Windows documentation (LONG).
    I don't think it matters one way or the others.
