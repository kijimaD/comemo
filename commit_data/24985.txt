    runtime: simplify mSpan_Sweep
    
    This is a cleanup following cc8f544, which was a minimal change to fix
    issue #11617. This consolidates the two places in mSpan_Sweep that
    update sweepgen. Previously this was necessary because sweepgen must
    be updated before freeing the span, but we freed large spans early.
    Now we free large spans later, so there's no need to duplicate the
    sweepgen update. This also means large spans can take advantage of the
    sweepgen sanity checking performed for other spans.
