    cmd/compile: fix disassembly of invalid instructions
    
    Make sure that if we encode an explicit base register, we print it.
    That will ensure that if we make an Addr with an auto variable but
    a base that isn't SP, then it will be obvious from the disassembly.
    
    Update #19184
