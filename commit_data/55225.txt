    cmd/compile: ensure register args come before on-stack args in schedule
    
    The register allocator doesn't like OpArg coming in between other
    OpIntArg operations, as it doesn't put the spills in the right place
    in that situation.
    
    This is just a bug in the new scheduler, I didn't copy over the
    proper score from the old scheduler correctly.
