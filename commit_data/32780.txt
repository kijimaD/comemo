    cmd/internal/dwarf: update to DWARF4, emit frame_base
    
    In preparation for CL 41770, upgrade .debug_info to DWARF4, and emit
    DW_AT_frame_base on subprograms. This should make no semantic
    difference.
    
    Also fix a long-standing bug/inconsistency in puttattr: it didn't
    add the addend to ref_addrs. Previously this didn't matter because it
    was only used for types, but now it's used for section offsets into
    symbols that have multiple entries.
    
    RELNOTE=yes
