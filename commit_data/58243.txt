    runtime: speed up readvarintUnsafe
    
    The documentation of readvarintUnsafe claims itself and readvarint are
    duplicated. However, two implementation are not in synced, since when
    readvarint got some minor improvements in CL 43150.
    
    Updating readvarintUnsafe to match readvarint implementation to gain a
    bit of speed. While at it, also updating its documentation to clarify
    the main difference.
    
    name                    time/op
    ReadvarintUnsafe/old-8  6.04ns ± 2%
    ReadvarintUnsafe/new-8  5.31ns ± 3%
