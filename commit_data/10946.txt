    go/doc: steps towards collecting methods of embedded types
    
    No visible external changes yet. The current approach is
    a stop-gap approach: For methods of anonymous fields to be
    seen, the anonymous field's types must be exported.
    
    Missing: computing the actual MethodDocs and displaying them.
    
    (Depending on the operation mode of godoc, the input to go/doc
    is a pre-filtered AST with all non-exported nodes removed. Non-
    exported anonymous fields are not even seen by go/doc in this
    case, and it is impossible to collect associated (even exported)
    methods. A correct fix will require some more significant re-
    engineering; AST filtering will have to happen later, possibly
    inside go/doc.)
