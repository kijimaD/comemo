commit 1f26e77e5901fb198599f12f615d0222dd7e7984
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    cmd/go: include Fortran files in build ID computation
    
    Otherwise removing a .f file won't trigger a rebuild.
    Noticed by inspection while working on the code.
    I don't have a good way to write a test for this,
    and I expect the code to change significantly in the next
    release, but might as well get it right for Go 1.9.
