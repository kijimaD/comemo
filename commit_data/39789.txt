    bytes/hash: disable seed test on 32-bit platforms
    
    The distribution of hash outputs when varying the seed is
    not good enough on 32-bit platforms.
    
    This isn't a likely attack vector (the adversary controlling the seed),
    so it isn't a huge deal. Would be nice to fix, though. For now, just
    skip this test.
    
    Fixes #33988
