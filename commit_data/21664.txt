    runtime: use more natural types in struct workbuf
    
    Until recently, struct workbuf had only lfnode and uintptr fields
    before the obj array to make it convenient to compute the size of the
    obj array.  It slowly grew more fields until this became inconvenient
    enough that it was restructured to make the size computation easy.
    Now the size computation doesn't care what the field types are, so
    switch to more natural types.
