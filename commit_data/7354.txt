    go spec: adjust notion of Assignability
    
    This change makes it legal to pass a struct value as receiver
    outside the package declaring the struct even if the respective
    struct type has non-exported fields.
    
    This is a backwards-compatible language change motivated by the
    fact that it is already possible to circumvent the assignment
    restriction when calling methods through interfaces (see issue
    1402).
