    os/exec: fix -test.run argument for new 'go test'
    
    In 'go test' I deleted the leading package. prefix
    from all the test names, since it contained no actual
    information.  Adjust the -test.run argument accordingly.
    This will still work with the current gotest too, since
    the argument is an unanchored pattern.
