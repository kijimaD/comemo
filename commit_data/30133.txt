Author: Sameer Ajmani <sameer@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 7 12:27:29 2017 -0500

    time: delete incorrect docs about day-of-month checks.
    
    Documentation was introduced by CL https://golang.org/cl/14123
    but that behavior was changed later by CL https://golang.org/cl/17710.
    This CL deletes the stale paragraph.
    
    Fixes #18980
