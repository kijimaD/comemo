    compress/flate: implement Flush
    
    This Flush is equivalent to zlib's Z_SYNC_FLUSH.
    The addition of the explicit Writer type opens the
    door to adding a PartialFlush if needed for SSH
    and maybe even FullFlush.  It also opens the door
    for a SetDictionary method to be added.

    documents the various intricacies of flushing a
    DEFLATE stream.
