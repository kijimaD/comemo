    time: in Format give buffer an initial capacity
    
    I have a small web server that simply sets several cookies
    along with an expires header, and then returns.  In the
    cpuprofile for a 200k request benchmark, time.Time.Format()
    was showing up as 8.3% of cpu usage.  Giving the buffer an
    inital capacity to avoid reallocs on append drops it down to
    7.6%.
