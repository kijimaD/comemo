commit 04a89054428b4da8f56300edcf0eb180abb9c8dd
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    gob: updates to the debugging tool.
    - complex numbers now supported.
    - entirely independent of standard decode code.
    - parser has no read-ahead; that is, the scanning works
    simply by reading the values as they arrive, not by trying
    to count bytes for message boundaries, a proof of concept
    for the pending rewrite of the regular decoder.
