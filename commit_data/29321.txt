    doc: avoid mentioning non-existence of u flag to fmt.Printf.
    
    It is better to document what golang does, rather than how it differs
    from languages which readers may or may not know.
    
    That the output format is based on the type is basically self-evident
    if you consider this just in go terms.

 	Pointer:
 		%p	base 16 notation, with leading 0x
 
-	There is no 'u' flag.  Integers are printed unsigned if they have unsigned type.
-	Similarly, there is no need to specify the size of the operand (int8, int64).
-
 	The default format for %v is:
 		bool:                    %t
 		int, int8 etc.:          %d
