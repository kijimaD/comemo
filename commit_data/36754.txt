    reflect: use correct write barrier operations for method funcs
    
    Fix the code to use write barriers on heap memory, and no
    write barriers on stack memory.
    
    These errors were discoverd as part of fixing #27695. They may
    have something to do with that issue, but hard to be sure.
    The core cause is different, so this fix is a separate CL.
    
    Update #27695
