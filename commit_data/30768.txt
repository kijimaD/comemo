    cmd/compile/internal/gc: fix liveness regression
    
    During AllocFrame, we drop unused variables from Curfn.Func.Dcl, but
    there might still be OpVarFoo instructions that reference those
    variables. This wasn't a problem though because gvardefx used to emit
    ANOP for unused variables instead of AVARFOO.
    
    As an easy fix, if we see OpVarFoo (or OpKeepAlive) referencing an
    unused variable, we can ignore it.
    
    Fixes #19632.
