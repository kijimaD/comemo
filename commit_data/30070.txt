    cmd/dist: move cmd/go z files to cmd/go/internal/cfg
    
    This is one CL in a long sequence of changes to break up the
    go command from one package into a plausible group of packages.
    
    This sequence is concerned only with moving code, not changing
    or cleaning up code. There will still be more cleanup after this sequence.
    
    The entire sequence will be submitted together: it is not a goal
    for the tree to build at every step.
    
    For #18653.
