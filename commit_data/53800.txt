    runtime: switch gp when jumping stacks during traceback
    
    Currently, when traceback jumps from the system stack to a user stack
    (e.g., during profiling tracebacks), it leaves gp pointing at the g0.
    This is currently harmless since it's only used during profiling, so
    the code paths in gentraceback that care about gp aren't used, but
    it's really confusing and would certainly break if _TraceJumpStack
    were ever used in a context other than profiling.
    
    Fix this by updating gp to point to the user g when we switch stacks.
    
    For #54466.
