    [dev.link] cmd/link: remove some unneeded code from writeBlock()
    
    The loader writeBlock() function has code that tries to skip the
    initial portion of the input symbols list depending on the address of
    the section being written-- this code is dead (skipping is never
    triggered) due to similar skipping in the callers; remove this
    preamble.
