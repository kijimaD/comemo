    runtime: use asmcgocall_no_g when calling sigprocmask on openbsd
    
    sigprocmask is called from sigsave, which is called from needm. As such,
    sigprocmask has to be able to run with no g. For some reason we do not
    currently trip this on current libc platforms, but we do hit it on
    openbsd/mips64 with external linking.
    
    Updates #36435
