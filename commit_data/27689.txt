    io: change the name of ReadAtSizer to SizedReaderAt
    
    This is a proposal. The old name is pretty poor. The new one describes
    it better and may be easier to remember. It does not start with Read,
    though I think that inconsistency is worthwhile.
    
    Reworded the comment a bit for clarity.
