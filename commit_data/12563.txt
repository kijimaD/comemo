    misc/dist: use archive/tar to generate tarballs
    
    For people untarring with -p or as root, preserving file permissions.
    This way we don't make tars owned by adg/eng or adg/staff or whatever
    machine Andrew was on. Instead, we always build tarballs owned by predictable
    users.
    
    Except archive/tar doesn't seem to work.
    
    Updates #3209.
