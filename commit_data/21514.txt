    net: document that user shouldn't modify returned Addr
    
    Ideally, those methods should return a copy of the Addr, but
    due to the Go 1 API guarantee, we cannot make that change now:
    there might exist client code that uses the returned Addr as
    map index and thus relies on the fact that different invocation
    of the method returns the same pointer. Changing this behavior
    will lead to hidden behaviour change in those programs.
    
    Update #9654.
