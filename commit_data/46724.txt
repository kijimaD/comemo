    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: fix escape analysis problem with closures
    
    In reflect.methodWrapper, we call escape analysis without including the
    full batch of dependent functions, including the closure functions.
    Because of this, we haven't created locations for the params/local
    variables of a closure when we are processing a function that
    inlines that closure. (Whereas in the normal compilation of the
    function, we do call with the full batch.) To deal with this, I am
    creating locations for the params/local variables of a closure when
    needed.
    
    Without this fix, the new test closure6.go would fail.
    
    Updates #43818
