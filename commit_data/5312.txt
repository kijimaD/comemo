    godashboard: bz2 compress logs in data store
    
    This results in a 10-20x size reduction per record.
    (from ~150kb to ~10kb)
    
    This revision has been pushed live, as I'm in the process of
    converting Log records to bz2-compresed CompressedLog records.
    I would have waited but we're running seriously low on space
    and it seemed like a sane (and reversible) move.
