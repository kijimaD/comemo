    testing: document that logs are dumped to standard output
    
    Since at least 1.0.3, the testing package has said that logs are dumped
    to standard error, but has in fact dumped the logs to standard output.
    We could change to dump to standard error, but after doing it this way
    for so long I think it's better to change the docs.
    
    Fixes #16138.
