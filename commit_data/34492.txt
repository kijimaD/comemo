    runtime: eliminate remaining recordspan write barriers
    
    recordspan has two remaining write barriers from writing to the
    pointer to the backing store of h.allspans. However, h.allspans is
    always backed by off-heap memory, so let the compiler know this.
    Unfortunately, this isn't quite as clean as most go:notinheap uses
    because we can't directly name the backing store of a slice, but we
    can get it done with some judicious casting.
    
    For #22460.
