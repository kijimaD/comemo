    cmd/compile: fix PGO cross-package inlining
    
    With CL 447015, we identify hot callees from edge weights, but
    the code only traverses edges for calls from the current package.
    If the callee is in a different package, when compiling that
    package, the edge was not visited, so the callee was not actually
    marked inline candidate. This CL fixes it by traversing all hot
    edges.
