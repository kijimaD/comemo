    runtime/metrics: update documentation to current interface
    
    The package documentation referenced sample metadata that was removed in CL 282632. Update this documentation to be less specific
    about what metadata is available.
    
    Additionally, the documentation on the Sample type referred to Descriptions instead of All as the source of metrics names.
    
    Fixes #44280.

 Metrics are designated by a string key, rather than, for example, a field name in

 Thus, users of this API are encouraged to sample supported metrics defined by the
