    misc/wasm: expect environment to provide polyfills
    
    The list of environments to support with wasm_exec.js was becoming too
    large to maintain. With this change, wasm_exec.js expects that the
    environment provides all necessary polyfills.
    
    The standardized "globalThis" is used for accessing the environment.
    wasm_exec.js now only provides stub fallbacks for globalThis.fs and
    globalThis.process.
    
    All code specific to Node.js is now in a separate file.
