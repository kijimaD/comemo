    syscall: fix duplicate fd bug for Plan 9
    
    This change comes from CL 5536043,
    created by Andrey Mirtchovski. His
    description follows:
    
    "The plan9 exec child handler does not manage
    dup-ed fds from the parent correctly: when a
    dup-ed file descriptor appears in the child's fd
    list it is closed when first encountered and then
    subsequent attempt to dup it later in Pass 2 fails,
    resulting in 'fork/exec: fd out of range or not
    open'."
