    runtime: break out the debug.malloc codepaths into functions
    
    This change breaks out the debug.malloc codepaths into dedicated
    functions, both for making mallocgc easier to read, and to reduce the
    function's size (currently all that code is inlined and really doesn't
    need to be).
    
    This is a microoptimization that on its own changes very little, but
    together with other optimizations and a breaking up of the various
    malloc paths will matter all together ("death by a thousand cuts").
