    cmd/compile: speed up TestAssembly
    
    TestAssembly was very slow, leading to it being skipped by default.
    This is not surprising, it separately invoked the compiler and
    parsed the result many times.
    
    Now the test assembles one source file for arch/os combination,
    containing the relevant functions.
    
    Tests for each arch/os run in parallel.
    
    Now the test runs approximately 10x faster on my Intel(R) Core(TM)
    i5-6600 CPU @ 3.30GHz.
    
    Fixes #18966
