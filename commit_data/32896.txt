    cmd/go: rename .o files going into final .a
    
    CL 64793 removed the collect step, which took all
    the generated .o files and merged them into a single _all.o.
    Now the generated .o files all go directly into the final .a.
    
    The only property of the _all.o approach that was lost
    in CL 64793 was that before we could be sure that the
    one name we used was "ar-compatible", that is, short
    enough not to be truncated.
    
    Now that the generated .o files are being kept directly,
    this CL gives them guaranteed ar-compatible names.
    
    This doesn't matter for nearly all uses today, but for some
    future processing it might help not to lose the .o suffix
    or not to end up with two identical entries with truncated
    names.
    
    I might not have bothered with this except that it's what's
    leftover after syncing my own CL disabling _all.o
    (necessary for reproducible builds on macOS) against
    Ian's CL 64793, which landed first.
