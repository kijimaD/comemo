    cmd/dist: move "devel" substring in git-inferred development version
    
    Keep the property that the "devel" substring is always present in these
    development versions of Go, but also gain the property that it's viable
    to use functions in the go/version package such as Lang, Compare, and
    get the expected results without needing to trim the "devel " prefix.
    
    For #73369.
    For #41116.
    Fixes #73372.
