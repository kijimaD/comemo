    runtime: pace the scavenger according to 1% of overall CPU time
    
    Currently the scavenger is paced to 1% of 1 CPU because it had
    scalability problems. As of the last few CLs, that should be largely
    resolved. This change resolves the TODO and paces the scavenger
    according to 1% of overall CPU time.
    
    This change is made separately to allow it to be more easily rolled
    back.
