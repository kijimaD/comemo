    cmd/link: enable DWARF with external linker on aix/ppc64
    
    In order to allow DWARF with ld, the symbol table is adapted.
    In internal linkmode, each package is considered as a .FILE. However,
    current version of ld is crashing on a few programs because of
    relocations between DWARF symbols. Considering all packages as part of
    one .FILE seems to bypass this bug.
    As it might be fixed in a future release, the size of each package
    in DWARF sections is still retrieved and can be used when it's fixed.
    Moreover, it's improving internal linkmode which should have done it
    anyway.
