    time: skip a often-flaky test in short mode
    
    In -test.short mode, skip measuring the upper bound of time
    sleeps. The API only guarantees minimum bounds on sleeps,
    anyway, so this isn't a bug we're ignoring as much as it is
    simply observing bad builder virtualization and/or loaded
    machines.
    
    We keep the test in full mode where developers will
    presumably be running on a lightly-loaded, native, fast
    machine.
