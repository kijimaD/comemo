    os: use the syscall version of Getwd for Plan 9
    
    In Plan 9, each OS thread has its own independent working directory,
    so the Go runtime for Plan 9 needs to coordinate Chdir and Getwd
    operations to keep the working directory consistent for all goroutines.
    
    The function os.Getwd in Plan 9 should always call syscall.Getwd
    to retrieve the common working directory.  Failure to do this was
    the cause of (at least some of) the intermittent failures in the
    Plan 9 builders with a seemingly spurious "file does not exist"
    message, when a thread's working directory had been removed in
    another thread.
