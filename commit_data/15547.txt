commit 67a6b4f0ef04e547e671230d84f96b00a2966113
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 1 16:45:14 2013 -0800

    spec: fallthrough may not appear in last clause of a switch
    
    Replacement for CL 7370053 which attempted to make fallthrough's
    syntactically a part of switch statements. Because they may be
    labeled, fixing that CL completely would require too much spec
    surgery.
    
    Fixes #4923.
