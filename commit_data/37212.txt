    runtime: don't wake timeproc needlessly
    
    It's not always necessary to wake timerproc even if we add
    a new timer to the top of the heap. Since we don't wake and
    reset timerproc when we remove timers, it still can be sleeping
    with shorter timeout. It such case it's more profitable to let it
    sleep and then update timeout when it wakes on its own rather than
    proactively wake it, let it update timeout and go to sleep again.
