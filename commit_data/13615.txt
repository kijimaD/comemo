    exp/html: ignore self-closing flag except in SVG and MathML
    
    In HTML content, having a self-closing tag is a parse error unless
    the tag would be self-closing anyway (like <img>). The only place a
    self-closing tag actually makes a difference is in XML-based foreign
    content.
    
    Pass 1 additional test.
