    cmd/compile: don't emit stack maps for write barrier calls
    
    These are necessarily deeply non-preemptible, so there's no point in
    emitting stack maps for them. We already mark them as unsafe points,
    so this only affects the runtime, since user code does not emit stack
    maps at unsafe points. SSAGenState.PrepareCall also excludes them when
    it's sanity checking call stack maps.
    
    Right now this only drops a handful of unnecessary stack maps from the
    runtime, but we're about to start emitting stack maps only at calls
    for user code, too. At that point, this will matter much more.
    
    For #36365.
