    cmd/internal/obj/x86: adjust SP correctly for tail calls
    
    Currently, tail calls on x86 don't adjust the SP on return, so it's
    important that the compiler produce a zero-sized frame and disable the
    frame pointer. However, these constraints aren't necessary. For
    example, on other architectures it's generally necessary to restore
    the saved LR before a tail call, so obj simply makes this work.
    Likewise, on x86, there's no reason we can't simply make this work.
    
    Hence, this CL adjusts the compiler to use the same tail call
    convention for x86 that we use on LR machines by producing a RET with
    a target, rather than a JMP with a target. In fact, obj already
    understands this convention for x86 except that it's buggy with
    non-zero frame sizes. So we also fix this bug obj. As a result of
    these fixes, the compiler no longer needs to mark wrappers as
    NoFramePointer since it's now perfectly fine to save the frame
    pointer.
    
    In fact, this eliminates the only use of NoFramePointer in the
    compiler, which will enable further cleanups.
    
    This also fixes what is very nearly, but not quite, a code generation
    bug. NoFramePointer becomes obj.NOFRAME in the object file, which on
    ppc64 and s390x means to omit the saved LR. Hence, on these
    architectures, NoFramePointer (and NOFRAME) is only safe to set on
    leaf functions. However, on *most* architectures, wrappers aren't
    necessarily leaf functions because they may call DUFFZERO. We're saved
    on ppc64 and s390x only because the compiler doesn't have the rules to
    produce DUFFZERO calls on these architectures. Hence, this only works
    because the set of LR architectures that implement NOFRAME is disjoint
    from the set where the compiler produces DUFFZERO operations. (I
    discovered this whole mess when I attempted to add NOFRAME support to
    arm.)
