    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: handle calling a method on a type param in stenciling
    
     - Have to delay the extra transformation on methods invoked on a type
       param, since the actual transformation (including path through
       embedded fields) will depend on the instantiated type. I am currently
       doing the transformation during the stencil substitution phase. We
       probably should have a separate pass after noder2 and stenciling,
       which drives the extra transformations that were in the old
       typechecker.
    
     - We handle method values (that are not called) and method calls. We
       don't currently handle method expressions.
    
     - Handle type substitution in function types, which is needed for
       function args in generic functions.
    
     - Added stringer.go and map.go tests, testing the above changes
       (including constraints with embedded interfaces).
