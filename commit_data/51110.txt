    doc/go1.18: minor tweaks to generics section
    
    This CL reorders the bullet points in the generics section to more
    closely match what I think users will consider most important. I put
    the ~ token before the mention of ~T in interfaces to avoid a forward
    reference, though I wonder if we actually want to spent a couple more
    sentences saying what union and ~T types are, since most people are
    going to care about that a lot more than they care about the low-level
    detail that there's a new token.
    
    For #47694.
