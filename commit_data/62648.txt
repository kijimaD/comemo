    cmd/internal/obj/riscv: fix the encoding for REV8 and ORCB
    
    The instructions are currently encoded and validated using an
    iIIEncoding which is incorrect as these instructions do not
    take an immediate operand.  Encode them instead using an
    rIIEncoding as is done for the other two register argument bitmanip
    instructions.
