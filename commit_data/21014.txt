    runtime: don't stop bitmap dump at BitsDead
    
    Stack bitmaps need to be scanned past any BitsDead entries.
    
    Object bitmaps will not have any BitsDead in them (bitmap extraction stops at
    the first BitsDead entry in makeheapobjbv).  data/bss bitmaps also have no BitsDead entries.
