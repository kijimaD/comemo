    crypto/tls: remove version check when unmarshaling sessionState
    
    This was causing issues when fuzzing with
    TestMarshalUnmarshal since the test would
    occassionally set the version to VersionTLS13,
    which would fail when unmarshaling. The check
    doesn't add much in practice, and there is no
    harm in removing it to de-flake the test.
    
    Fixes #38902
