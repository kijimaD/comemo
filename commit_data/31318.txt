    path/filepath: fix TestWinSplitListTestsAreValid on some systems
    
    The environment variables used in those tests override the default
    OS ones. However, one of them (SystemRoot) seems to be required on
    some Windows systems for invoking cmd.exe properly.
    
    This fixes #4930 and #6568.
