    cmd/go: disable automatic go vet -unreachable during go test of std
    
    go test runs a limited number of vet checks by default.
    In the standard library, we run more, both to get additional checking
    for the standard library and to get experience with whether to enable
    any others by default.
    
    One that experience has shown us should not be enabled by default
    is go vet -unreachable. When you are testing, it is common to want to
    put an early return or a panic into code to bypass a section of code.
    That often causes unreachable code. It's incredibly frustrating if the
    result is an "unreachable code" error that keeps your test from completing.
