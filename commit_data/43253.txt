    build: force all Windows batch files to CRLF
    
    Batch files should use CRLF endings. LF endings mostly
    work but in some situations they cause random errors like
    goto commands failing for mysterious reasons. See
    golang.org/issue/37791 for more information.
    
    Next CL triggered one of such bug (a label was not being
    recognized), so prepare for it by converting to CRLF.
    
    This CL also touches all existing batch files to force git
    to update the line endings (unfortunately, changing
    .gitattributes only has effect next time the file is checked
    out or modified).
    
    Fixes #37791
    Updates #9281
