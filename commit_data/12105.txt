commit ecd24f381e189df32f558ffab04b829cd4713649

    exp/norm: Added Iter type for iterating on segment boundaries.  This type is mainly to be used
    by other low-level libraries, like collate.  Extra care has been given to optimize the performance
    of normalizing to NFD, as this is what will be used by the collator.  The overhead of checking
    whether a string is normalized vs simply decomposing a string is neglible.  Assuming that most
    strings are in the FCD form, this iterator can be used to decompose strings and normalize with
    minimal overhead.
