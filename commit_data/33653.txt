    test: make inline_callers.go test not inline the runtime
    
    CL 76551 modified inline_callers.go to build everything, including the
    runtime, with -l=4. While that works in most places (and ideally
    should work everywhere), it blows out the nosplit stack on
    solaris/amd64.
    
    Fix this by only building the test itself with -l=4.
    
    This undoes some of the changes to this test from CL 73212, which
    originally changed the go tool to rebuild all packages with the given
    flags. This change modified the expected output of this test, so now
    that we can go back to building only the test itself with inlining, we
    revert these changes to the expected output. (That CL also changed
    log.Fatalf to log.Printf, but didn't add "\n" to the end of the lines,
    so this CL fixes that, too.)
    
    Fixes #22797.
