    cmd/go, misc: switch from breakpoint to SIGUSR2
    
    The iOS test harness has set a breakpoint early in the life of Go
    programs so that it can change the current working directory using
    information only available from the host debugger. Somewhere in the
    upgrade to iOS 10 / XCode 8.2, breakpoints stopped working. This
    may be an LLDB bug, or a bug in the ios-deploy LLDB scripts, it's
    not clear.
    
    Work around the problem by giving up on breakpoints. Instead, early
    in the life of every test binary built for iOS, send (and ignore) a
    SIGUSR2 signal. The debugger will catch this, giving the script
    go_darwin_arm_exec a chance to change the working directory.
    
    For the iOS builders.
