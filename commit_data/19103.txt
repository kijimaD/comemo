    net/http: document, test, define, clean up Request.Trailer
    
    Go's had pretty decent HTTP Trailer support for a long time, but
    the docs have been largely non-existent. Fix that.
    
    In the process, re-learn the Trailer code, clean some stuff
    up, add some error checks, remove some TODOs, fix a minor bug
    or two, and add tests.
