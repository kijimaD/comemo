    go/internal/gccgoimporter: enhance for new export data, fix test issues
    
    This patch merges in support for reading indexed type export data,
    from the gofrontend CL https://golang.org/cl/143022 (which includes
    a change in the export data version number from V2 to V3).
    
    Also fixes the key tests to insure that they run both in gccgo builds
    and main Go repo builds if "gccgo" is present (prior to this the tests
    were not running in either scenario); this required fixing up some of
    the expected results.
    
    Fixes #28961.
