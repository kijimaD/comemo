    misc/vim: test.sh seems to only work on Mac OS X.
    
    cmp(1) on FreeBSD requires two file arguments.  grep -P on Linux (at least
    Ubuntu 12.04) is described in the man page as "This is highly
    experimental" and doesn't seem to work. On FreeBSD the man page states
    "This option  is not supported in FreeBSD."  Needed this to work while
    debugging some funky behavior of 'Import' in my local vim setup.
