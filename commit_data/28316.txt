    runtime: improve heapBitsSetType documentation
    
    Currently the heapBitsSetType documentation says that there are no
    races on the heap bitmap, but that isn't exactly true. There are no
    *write-write* races, but there are read-write races. Expand the
    documentation to explain this and why it's okay.
