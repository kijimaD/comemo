    runtime: simplify hashmap tooManyOverflowBuckets
    
    This generates better code.
    
    Masking B in the return statement should be unnecessary,
    but the compiler is understandably not yet clever enough to see that.
    
    Someday, it'd also be nice for the compiler to generate
    a CMOV for the saturation if statement.
