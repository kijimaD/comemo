commit 78547ca13214e6e3062fb5600afe05bd2e6d93dc
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 30 14:54:32 2010 -0700

    time: do not segment time strings by character class.
    instead use pure substring matching to find template values.
    
    this makes stdZulu unnecessary and allows formats
    like "20060102 030405" (used in some internet protocols).
    
    this makes Parse not handle years < 0000 or > 9999 anymore.
    that seems like an okay price to pay, trading hypothetical
    functionality for real functionality.
    
    also changed the comments on the Time struct to use the
    same reference date as the format and parse routines.
