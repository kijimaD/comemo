    cmd/link/internal/ld: don't panic on short buildid
    
    When the linker was written in C, command line arguments were passed
    around as null-terminated byte arrays which encouraged checking
    characters one at a time. In Go, that can easily lead to
    out-of-bounds panics.
    
    Use the more idiomatic strings.HasPrefix when checking cmd/link's -B
    argument to avoid the panic, and replace the manual hex decode with
    use of the encoding/hex package.
    
    Fixes #14636
