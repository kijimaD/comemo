+This weekly snapshot includes a language change and a change to the image
+package that may require changes to client code.
+
+The language change is that an "else" block is now required to have braces
+except if the body of the "else" is another "if". Since gofmt always puts those
+braces in anyway, programs will not be affected unless they contain "else for",
+"else switch", or "else select". Run gofmt to fix any such programs.
+
+The image package has had significant changes made to the Pix field of struct
+types such as image.RGBA and image.NRGBA. The image.Image interface type has
+not changed, though, and you should not need to change your code if you don't
+explicitly refer to Pix fields. For example, if you decode a number of images
+using the image/jpeg package, compose them using image/draw, and then encode
+the result using image/png, then your code should still work as before.
+
+If you do explicitly refer to Pix fields, there are two changes.  First, Pix[0]
+now refers to the pixel at Bounds().Min instead of the pixel at (0, 0). Second,
+the element type of the Pix slice is now uint8 instead of image.FooColor. For
+example, for an image.RGBA, the channel values will be packed R, G, B, A, R, G,
+B, A, etc. For 16-bits-per-channel color types, the pixel data will be stored
+as big-endian uint8s.
+
+Most Pix field types have changed, and so if your code still compiles after
+this change, then you probably don't need to make any further changes (unless
+you use an image.Paletted's Pix field). If you do get compiler errors, code
+that used to look like this:
+
+	// Get the R, G, B, A values for the pixel at (x, y).
+	var m *image.RGBA = loadAnImage()
+	c := m.Pix[y*m.Stride + x]
+	r, g, b, a := c.R, c.G, c.B, c.A
+
+should now look like this:
+
+	// Get the R, G, B, A values for the pixel at (x, y).
+	var m *image.RGBA = loadAnImage()
+	i := (y-m.Rect.Min.Y)*m.Stride + (x-m.Rect.Min.X)*4
+	r := m.Pix[i+0]
+	g := m.Pix[i+1]
+	b := m.Pix[i+2]
+	a := m.Pix[i+3]
+
+This image package change will not be fixed by gofix: how best to translate
+code into something efficient and idiomatic depends on the surrounding context,
+and is not easily automatable. Examples of what to do can be found in the
+changes to image/draw/draw.go in http://codereview.appspot.com/4675076/
