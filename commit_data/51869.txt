    cmd/compile: remove regabi magic names
    
    When developing register ABI, for early testing the compiler
    recognized a few magic names to trigger enabling register ABI.
    After the development it is disabled (changed to a name that
    cannot be spelled in the source code). Later in the development of
    register ABI for ARM64 and PPC64, I don't think the magic names
    were used. I think they can now be removed.
    
    Keep the magic pragma for now in case it helps development.
