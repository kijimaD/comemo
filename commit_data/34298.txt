    cmd/compile: use | in the most repetitive mips64 rules
    
    For now, limited to the most repetitive rules that are also short and
    simple, so that we can have a substantial conciseness win without
    compromising rules readability.
    
    Ran rulegen, no change in the actual compiler code (as expected).
