    net/http: update bundled copy of http2, enable TestTrailersServerToClient tests
    
    This CL updates the bundled copy of x/net/http2 to include
    https://golang.org/cl/17930 and enables the previously-skipped tests
    TestTrailersServerToClient_h2 and TestTrailersServerToClient_Flush_h2.
    
    It also updates the docs on http.Response.Trailer to describe how to
    use it. No change in rules. Just documenting the old unwritten rules.
    (there were tests locking in the behavior, and misc docs and examples
    scattered about, but not on http.Response.Trailer itself)
    
    Updates #13557
