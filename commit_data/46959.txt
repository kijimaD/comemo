    runtime: delete windows setlasterror (unused)
    
    This is dead code and need not be ported to each architecture.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
