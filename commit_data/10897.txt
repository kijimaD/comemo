commit c50e4f5e2f260ff2b68a127843b197443460043f
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    testing: allow benchmarks to print and fail
    Refactors the benchmarks and test code.
    Now benchmarks can call Errorf, Fail, etc.,
    and the runner will act accordingly.
    
    Because functionality has been folded into an
    embedded type, a number of methods' docs
    no longer appear in godoc output. A fix is
    underway; if it doesn't happen fast enough,
    I'll add wrapper methods to restore the
    documentation.
