    cmd/internal/dwarf: always use AT_ranges for scopes with DWARF 5
    
    This patch extends the change in CL 657175 to apply the same abbrev
    selection strategy to single-range lexical scopes that we're now using
    for inlined routine bodies, when DWARF 5 is in effect. Ranges are more
    compact and use fewer relocation than explicit hi/lo PC values, so we
    might as well always use them.
    
    Updates #26379.
