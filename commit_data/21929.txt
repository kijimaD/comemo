    runtime: eliminate drainworkbufs from scanblock
    
    scanblock is only called during _GCscan and _GCmarktermination.
    During _GCscan, scanblock didn't call drainworkbufs anyway.  During
    _GCmarktermination, there's really no point in draining some (largely
    arbitrary) amount of work during the scanblock, since the GC is about
    to drain everything anyway, so simply eliminate this case.
