commit 804e3e565e98e1ff3a22eb354a473225f6dc7351

    runtime: don't check for String/Error methods in printany
    
    They have either already been called by preprintpanics, or they can
    not be called safely because of the various conditions checked at the
    start of gopanic.
    
    Fixes #24059
