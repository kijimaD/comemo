    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: Use varkill only for non-SSAable vars
    
    For variables which get SSA'd, SSA keeps track of all the def/kill.
    It is only for on-stack variables that we need them.
    
    This reduces stack frame sizes significantly because often the
    only use of a variable was a varkill, and without that last use
    the variable doesn't get allocated in the frame at all.
    
    Fixes #12602
