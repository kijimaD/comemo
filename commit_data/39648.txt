    archive/zip: remove unused special case
    
    This removes a special case that was added to fix issue #10956, but that
    was never actually effective. The code in the test case still fails to
    read, so perhaps the zip64 support added in CL 6463050 inadvertently
    caught this particular case.
    
    It's possible that the original theorized bug still exists, but I'm not
    convinced it was ever fixed.
    
    Update #28700
