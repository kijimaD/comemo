    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: don't immediate dereference new prog
    
    Noticed by Cherry while reviewing CL 40252.
    
    The alternative to this is to place t on the stack, like
    
    t := obj.Prog{Ctxt: ctxt}
    
    However, there are only a couple of places where we
    manually construct Progs, which is useful.
    
    This isn't hot enough code to warrant
    breaking abstraction layers to avoid an allocation.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
