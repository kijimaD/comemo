    doc: add a diagnostics guide
    
    Diagnostics guide lists various dimensions of
    diagnostics tools and libraries available in Go.
    As a follow-up, I will add an entry section where
    we navigate user to the right tool depending on
    the type of problem they are willing to improve
    or understand better.
