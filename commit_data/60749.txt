    runtime: fix nanotime1 on windows/arm
    
    nanotime1 is broken on windows/arm since CL 526358, which
    unintentionally removed a necessary instruction. It hasn't been
    noticed till now because the there is no windows/arm builder.
    
    This CL restores the instruction.
    
    Fixes #68996.
