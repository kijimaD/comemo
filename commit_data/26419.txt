    runtime: save context value in NetBSD sigtramp
    
    On NetBSD a signal handler returns to the kernel by calling the
    setcontext system call with the context passed to the signal handler.
    The implementation of runtimeÂ·sigreturn_tramp for amd64, copied from the
    NetBSD libc, expects that context address to be in r15.  That works in
    the NetBSD libc because r15 is preserved across the call to the signal
    handler.  It fails in the Go library because r15 is not preserved.
    There are various ways to fix this; this one uses the simple approach,
    essentially identical to the one in the NetBSD libc, of preserving r15
    across the signal handler proper.
    
    Looking at the code for 386 and arm suggests that they are OK.  However,
    I have not actually tested them.
    
    Update #14052.
