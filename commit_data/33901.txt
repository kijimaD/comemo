    [dev.boringcrypto] crypto/aes: panic on invalid dst, src overlap
    
    I've now debugged multiple mysterious "inability to communicate"
    bugs that manifest as a silent unexplained authentication failure but are
    really crypto.AEAD.Open being invoked with badly aligned buffers.
    In #21624 I suggested using a panic as the consequence of bad alignment,
    so that this kind of failure is loud and clearly different from, say, a
    corrupted or invalid message signature. Adding the panic here made
    my failure very easy to track down, once I realized that was the problem.
    I don't want to debug another one of these.
    
    Also using this CL as an experiment to get data about the impact of
    maybe applying this change more broadly in the master branch.
