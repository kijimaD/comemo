    [dev.link] cmd/link: don't always load type symbols
    
    The type symbols were always loaded in LoadFull, as the old
    sym.Symbol-based DWARF generation needs them to present. Now we
    have converted the DWARF type generation pass, which uses the
    loader symbols directly. No need to load the type symbols if they
    are not live.
    
    This reduces loaded symbols by ~18% for cmd/compile.
