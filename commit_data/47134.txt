    cmd/compile: make -memprofilerate work
    
    There are multiple things preventing the -memprofilerate flag from
    working right now:
    
    - CmdFlags.MemProfileRate has type int64, which is currently not
      supported by the compiler's reflection-based registerFlags.
      Unfortunately, rather than letting you know this, registerFlags
      simply ignores this field.
    
    - Nothing consumes CmdFlags.MemProfileRate anyway. startProfile
      instead uses a package-local memprofilerate variable that is never
      set to anything.
    
    Fix this by making CmdFlags.MemProfileRate an int (that's what
    runtime.MemProfileRate is anyway) and using it in startProfile. While
    we're here, prevent similar flag parsing bugs in the future by making
    registerFlags panic if it encounters a flag field of unsupported type.
