    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of assignments.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/assignments.go
    and assignments.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker.
    
    The primary differences to go/types/assignments.go are:
    - use of syntax instead of go/ast package
    - no reporting of error codes (for now)
    - different handling of nil values (we can't use Typ[UntypedNil]
      to represent an untyped nil because types2 gives such nil values
      context-dependent types)
