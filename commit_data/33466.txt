    runtime: flush assist credit on goroutine exit
    
    Currently dead goroutines retain their assist credit. This credit can
    be used if the goroutine gets recycled, but in general this can make
    assist pacing over-aggressive by hiding an amount of credit
    proportional to the number of exited (and not reused) goroutines.
    
    Fix this "hidden credit" by flushing assist credit to the global
    credit pool when a goroutine exits.
    
    Updates #14812.
