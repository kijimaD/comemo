    cmd/compile,cmd/link: move to DWARF5-style location lists
    
    This patch updates the compiler to generate DWARF5-style location
    lists (e.g. entries that feed into .debug_loclists) as opposed to
    DWARF4-style location lists (which wind up in .debug_loc). The DWARF5
    format is much more compact, and can make indirect references to text
    addresses via the .debug_addr section for further space savings.
    
    Updates #26379.
