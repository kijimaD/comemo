    cmd/compile: improve register overwrite decision for resultInArg0 ops
    
    When we're compiling a resultInArg0 op, we need to clobber the
    register containing the input value. So we first make a register copy
    of the input value. We can then clobber either of the two registers
    the value is in and still have the original input value in a register
    for future uses.
    
    Before this CL, we always clobbered the original, not the copy.
    But that's not always the right decision - if the original is already
    in a specific register that it needs to be in later (typically, a
    return value register), clobber the copy instead.
    
    This optimization can remove a mov instruction. It saves 1376 bytes
    of instructions in cmd/go.
    
    Redo of CL 460656, reverted at CL 463475, with a fix for s390x.
    
    The new code just ensures that the copied value is in a register
    which is a valid input register for the instruction.
