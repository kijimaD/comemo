    net/http: redirect host-based patterns to trailing slash
    
    Handlers can be registered for specific hosts by specifying the host as
    part of the mux pattern. If a trailing slash route is registered for
    these host-based patterns, shouldRedirect should indicate that
    a redirect is required.
    
    This change modifies shouldRedirect to also take the host of the
    request, and now considers host-based patterns while determining if
    a request should be redirected.
    
    Fixes #23183
