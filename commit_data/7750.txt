    net: don't loop to drain wakeup pipe.
    
    The loop always makes an extra system call.  It only makes a
    difference if more than 100 goroutines started waiting for
    something to happen on a network file descriptor since the
    last time the pipe was drained, which is unlikely since we
    will be woken up the first time a goroutine starts waiting.
    If we don't drain the pipe this time, we'll be woken up again
    right away and can drain again.
