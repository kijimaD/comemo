    cmd/compile: move duplicate type-case checking into typecheck
    
    Part of the general trend of moving yyerror calls out of walk and into
    typecheck.
    
    Notably, this requires splitting test/typeswitch2.go into two files,
    because now some of the errors are reported during typecheck and
    others are still reported during walk; and if there were any errors
    during typecheck, then cmd/compile exits without invoking walk.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
