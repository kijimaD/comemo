    net/http: support If-Match in ServeContent
    
    - Added support for If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since.
    - Precondition checks now more strictly follow RFC 7232 section 6, which
    affects precedence when multiple condition headers are present.
    - When serving a 304, Last-Modified header is now removed when no ETag is
    present (as suggested by RFC 7232 section 4.1).
    - If-None-Match supports multiple ETags.
    - ETag comparison now correctly handles weak ETags.
    
    Fixes #17572
