    math/big: remove (*Float).Scan, ScanFloat; more robust (*Float).Parse
    
    - (*Float).Scan conflicted with fmt.Scanner.Scan; it was also only used
      internally. Removed it, as well as the companion ScanFloat function.
    
    - (*Float).Parse (and thus ParseFloat) can now also parse infinities.
      As a result, more code could be simplified.
    
    - Fixed a bug in rounding (round may implicitly be called for infinite
      values). Found via existing test cases, after simplifying some code.
    
    - Added more test cases.
    
    Fixes issue #10938.
