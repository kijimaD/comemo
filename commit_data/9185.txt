    godoc/httpzip.go: use correct path in Readdir
    
    Fixes a problem where Readdir would always return
    empty directories (Readdir is only called by godoc
    if the usual directory handler is commented out
    in godoc.go, and if a zip file system is provided;
    thus, this bug never manifested itself in godoc).
    
    Also:
    - better choice of variable/field names
    - simplified error handling a bit
    - better comments
