    net: replace sort with slices for address and DNS record sorting
    
    This change replaces the usage of the "sort" package with the "slices"
    package for sorting IP addresses and DNS records. The new approach
    simplifies the code and improves readability by leveraging the
    slices.SortFunc and slices.SortStableFunc functions.
    
    - Updated addrselect.go to use slices.SortStableFunc for sorting IP
      addresses based on RFC 6724.
    - Refactored dnsclient.go to use slices.SortFunc for sorting SRV and MX
      records by priority and weight.
    
    This change also reduces the dependency tree for the package by
    removing the dependency on "sort" and its transitive dependencies,
    resulting in a leaner build.
