    cmd/gc: turn race detector off for tail-call method wrapper functions
    
    It was off in the old implementation (because there was no high-level
    description of the function at all). Maybe some day the race detector
    should be fixed to handle the wrapper and then enabled for it, but there's
    no reason that has to be today.
