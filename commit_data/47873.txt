    net/http: skip TestClientTimeout_h{1,2} on windows/arm and windows/arm64
    
    These tests are empirically flaky on the windows/arm and windows/arm64
    builders, with a consistent (but rare) failure mode.
    
    This change skips the test if that particular failure mode is
    encountered on those platforms; the skip can be removed if and when
    someone has the time to pin down the root cause.
    
    For #43120
