    go/parser: add a SkipObjectResolution mode to bypass object resolution
    
    Parser object resolution is an auxiliary feature in which the parser
    attempts to resolve identifiers to their declarations. In functionality,
    it significantly overlaps with go/types and in fact cannot be correctly
    computed at parse-time without type information (for example, it is
    generally not possible to resolve k in the composite lit c{k: v}). Due
    to these limitations, it is of limited utility and rarely used.
    
    Now that object resolution is isolated as a post-processing pass, it is
    trivial to offer a parser mode that skips it entirely. This CL adds that
    mode.
    
    Fixes #45104
