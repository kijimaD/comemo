    runtime: merge timerModifiedEarlier and timerModifierLater
    
    Nothing actually needs to know the difference between these
    two states, so merge them.
    
    This is part of a larger simplification of the state set.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
