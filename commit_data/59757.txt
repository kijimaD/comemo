    cmd/go/internal/cfg: fix GOROOT setting when forcing host config
    
    We manage the state using a bunch of global config, so we need to make
    sure we're doing things in the right order. In this case, the SetGOROOT
    function was being called in init, setting the GOROOT on the global
    Context, but when we reset the context in ForceHost we lost the goroot
    configuration. We need to call SetGOROOT in ForceHost to re-set the
    GOROOT on the new context.
    
    This was uncovered by CL 677558 because a go command that was built with
    trimpath would try to use its runtime.GOROOT(), which wouldn't be valid
    in trimpath mode. Setting GOROOT properly with SetGOROOT will use the
    value from findGOROOT, assuming GOROOT isn't set in the environment,
    and findGOROOT will try to determine GOROOT using the path of the go
    command executable.
    
    For #71867
