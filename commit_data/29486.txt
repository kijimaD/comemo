    cmd/pprof: don't print binary outputs in interactive mode
    
    Some commands generate binary outputs which are not human readable.
    In interactive mode, there are no use-cases for such outputs.
    Instead, the new code writes it to the temporary file on the $CWD and
    shows the file name. So the user can use any program to display the
    file outside interactive shell.
    
    Fixes #17465
