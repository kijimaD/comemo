commit 02d1dae1069f881ea6b53ecc3cbf3bbe3ac40a72
Author: Adam Langley <agl@golang.org>

    crypto/x509: if a parent cert has a raw subject, use it.
    
    This avoids a problem when creating certificates with parents that
    were produce by other code: the Go structures don't contain all the
    information about the various ASN.1 string types etc and so that
    information would otherwise be lost.
