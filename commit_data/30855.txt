    runtime, syscall: update openbsd for changes to syskill
    
    Change the openbsd runtime to use the current sys_kill and sys_thrkill
    system calls.
    
    Prior to OpenBSD 5.9 the sys_kill system call could be used with both
    processes and threads. In OpenBSD 5.9 this functionality was split into
    a sys_kill system call for processes (with a new syscall number) and a
    sys_thrkill system call for threads. The original/legacy system call was
    retained in OpenBSD 5.9 and OpenBSD 6.0, however has been removed and
    will not exist in the upcoming OpenBSD 6.1 release.
    
    Note: This change is needed to make Go work on OpenBSD 6.1 (to be
    released in May 2017) and should be included in the Go 1.8 release.
    This change also drops support for OpenBSD 5.8, which is already an
    unsupported OpenBSD release.
