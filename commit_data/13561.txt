    exp/locale/collate: changed API of Builder to be more convenient
    for dealing with CLDR files:
    - Add now taxes a list of indexes of colelems that are variables. Checking and
      handling is now done by the Builder.  VariableTop is now also properly generated
      using the Build method.
    - Introduced separate Builder, called Tailoring, for creating tailorings of root
      table.  This clearly separates the functionality for building a table based on
      weights (the allkeys* files) versus tables based on LDML XML files.
    - Tailorings are now added by two calls instead of one: SetAnchor and Insert.
      This more closely reflects the structure of LDML side and simplifies the
      implementation of both the client and library side.  It also preserves
      some information that is otherwise hard to recover for the Builder.
    - Allow the LDML XML element extend to be passed to Insert.  This simplifies
      both client and library implementation.
