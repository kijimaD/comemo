    text/template: drop unused sortKeys function
    
    Recent change golang.org/cl/142737 drops the only call site for the
    sortKeys function. If it's not in use, it should probably not be there in
    the code, lurking and preparing to bite us when someone calls that instead
    of the new key sorter in fmtsort, resulting in strange inconsistencies.
    
    Since the function isn't called, this should have no impact.
    Related to, but does not fix, #21095.
