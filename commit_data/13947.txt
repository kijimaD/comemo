    cmd/dist: new version for string for development branch
    
    Remove VERSION, which was forcing version to 'devel'.
    
    Old:
    $ go version
    go version devel
    
    New:
    $ go version
    go version devel +0a3866d6cc6b Mon Sep 24 20:08:05 2012 -0400
    
    The date and time (and time zone) is that of the most recent commit,
    not the time of the build itself. With some effort we could normalize
    the zone, but I don't think it's worth the effort (more C coding,
    since Mercurial is unhelpful).
