    doc/go1.11: add link to new WebAssembly wiki page
    
    The wiki page has recently been created, and at this time it's
    just a stub. It's expected that support for WebAssembly will be
    evolving over time, and the wiki page can be kept updated with
    helpful information, how to get started, tips and tricks, etc.
    
    Use present tense because it's expected that there will be more
    general information added by the time Go 1.11 release happens.
    
    Also add link to https://webassembly.org/ in first paragraph.
