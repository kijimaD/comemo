    crypto/internal/edwards25519: replace scalar field with fiat-crypto
    
    This was the last piece of ref10 code, including the infamous "Christmas
    tree" in scMulAdd, that approximately all Ed25519 implementations
    inherited. Replace the whole scalar field implementation with a
    fiat-crypto generated one, like those in crypto/internal/nistec/fiat.
    
    The only complexity is the wide reduction (both for the 64-byte one and
    for the clamped input). For that we do a limbed reduction suggested by
    Frank Denis.
    
    Some minor housekeeping and test changes from filippo.io/edwards25519
    are included, as part of syncing with downstream.
