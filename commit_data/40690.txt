    html/template: handle nil Error values in context.String
    
    Add a special case to print a generic nil error when context.err is
    nil.
    
    Previously, this case was unchecked, leading to a call to (*Error).Error
    with a nil receiver, which was triggering a nil pointer access. However,
    this bug was masked by the panic-recovery code in package fmt.
    
    I tested this change by running `dlv test` in src/html/template, running
    the `continue` command, and verifying that no "bad access" errors are
    returned.
    
    Fixes #28854
