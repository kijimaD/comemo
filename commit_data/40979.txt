    runtime: syscall_forkx on Solaris can return error on success
    
    The syscall_forkx function returns the value of errno even on success.  This can be a problem when using cgo where an atfork handler might be registered; if the atfork handler does something which causes errno to be set the caller of syscall_forkx can be misled into thinking the fork has failed.  This causes the various exec functions in the runtime package to hang.
