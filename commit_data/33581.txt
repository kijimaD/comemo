    crypto/cipher: use raw bytes for keys in docs
    
    Using ASCII values for keys is a bad idea since it makes them vastly
    easier to guess. Instead, use the same method as the examples in the
    golang.org/x/crypto/nacl package to load keys from a hex value.
    
    Changing the key required updating the ciphertext in many of the
    examples.
    
    I am still worried about the fact the examples ask the user to
    authenticate messages; authentication isn't trivial, and to be honest
    it may be better to steer people to a higher level primitive like
    secretbox, unless people really need AES.
    
    Fixes #21012.
