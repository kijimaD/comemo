    cmd/internal/obj: drop Filesym from DwarfAbstractFunc
    
    PutAbstractFunc doesn't use FnState.Filesym, so it isn't needed, but
    more importantly it is misleading. DwarfAbstractFunc is frequently used
    on inlined functions from outside the current compilation unit. For
    those function, ctxt.fileSymbol returns nil, meaning it probably isn't
    safe to use if the original compilation unit could also generate an
    abstract func with the correct file symbol.
