    runtime: make test independent of inlining
    
    TestBreakpoint expects to see "runtime.Breakpoint()" in the stack trace.
    If runtime.Breakpoint() is inlined, then the stack trace prints
    "runtime.Breakpoint(...)" since the runtime does not have information
    about arguments (or lack thereof) to inlined functions. This change
    makes the test independent of inlining by looking for the string
    "runtime.Breakpoint(". Now TestBreakpoint passes with -l=4.
