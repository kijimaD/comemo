    doc: tweak Go 1.6 GC release notes
    
    Go 1.6 significantly improves pause times for large heaps, but it
    improves them in many other situations as well, such as when goroutine
    churn is high, allocation rate is high, or when there are many
    finalizers. Hence, make the statement about pause times a bit more
    general.
