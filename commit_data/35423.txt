    cmd/trace: fix a few bugs found by staticcheck
    
    First, the regions sort was buggy, as its last comparison was
    ineffective.
    
    Second, the insyscall and insyscallRuntime fields were unsigned, so the
    check for them being negative was pointless. Make them signed instead,
    to also prevent the possibility of underflows when decreasing numbers
    that might realistically be 0.
    
    Third, the color constants were all untyped strings except the first
    one. Be consistent with their typing.
