    cmd/go: -ldflags=-linkmode=external requires runtime/cgo
    
    We add runtime/cgo to the list of import paths for various cases that
    imply external linking mode, but before this change we did not add for
    an explicit request of external linking mode. This fixes the case where
    you are using a non-default buildmode that implies a different
    compilation option (for example, -buildmode=pie implies -shared) and the
    runtime/cgo package for that option is stale.
    
    No test, as I'm not sure how to write one. It would require forcing a
    stale runtime/cgo.
