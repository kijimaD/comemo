    testing: remove stale builder names from windows tests
    
    A couple of the windows runtime tests were being gated by "if
    testenv.Builder() == ..." guards that referred to builders that have
    long since been obsoleted (e.g. "windows-amd64-gce"). Use a more
    generic guard instead, checking for windows-<goarch> prefix.
