    net/mail: ignore whitespace between adjacent 'encoded-word's
    
    rfc2047 says:
      White space between adjacent 'encoded-word's is not displayed.
    
    Although, mime package already have that feature,
    we cannot simply reuse that code,
    because there is a subtle difference in quoted-string handling.
    
    Fixes #19363
