 ## Tools {#tools}
 
+### Telemetry
+
+<!-- go.dev/issue/58894, go.dev/issue/67111 -->
+Starting in Go 1.23, the Go toolchain can collect usage and breakage
+statistics that help the Go team understand how the Go toolchain is
+used and how well it is working. We refer to these statistics as
+[Go telemetry](/doc/telemetry).
+
+Go telemetry is an _opt-in system_, controlled by the
+[`go` `telemetry` command](/cmd/go/#hdr-Manage_telemetry_data_and_settings).
+By default, the toolchain programs
+collect statistics in counter files that can be inspected locally
+but are otherwise unused (`go` `telemetry` `local`).
+
+To help us keep Go working well and understand Go usage,
+please consider opting in to Go telemetry by running
+`go` `telemetry` `on`.
+In that mode,
+anonymous counter reports are uploaded to
+[telemetry.go.dev](https://telemetry.go.dev) weekly,
+where they are aggregated into graphs and also made
+available for download by any Go contributors or users
+wanting to analyze the data.
+See “[Go Telemetry](/doc/telemetry)” for more details
+about the Go Telemetry system.
