    crypto/x509: implement crypto.Signer
    
    Signer is an interface to support opaque private keys.
    These keys typically result from being kept in special hardware
    (i.e. a TPM) although sometimes operating systems provide a
    similar interface using process isolation for security rather
    than hardware boundaries.
    
    This changes provides updates implements crypto.Signer in
    CreateCRL and CreateCertificate so that they can be used with
    opaque keys.
