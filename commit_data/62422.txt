    runtime: add padding to m struct for 64 bit architectures
    
    CL 652276 reduced the m struct by 8 bytes, which has changed the
    allocation class on 64 bit OpenBSD platforms. This results in build
    failures due to:
    
        M structure uses sizeclass 1792/0x700 bytes; incompatible with mutex flag mask 0x3ff
    
    Add 128 bytes of padding when spinbitmutex is enabled on 64 bit
    architectures, moving the size to the half point between the
    1792 and 2048 allocation size.
