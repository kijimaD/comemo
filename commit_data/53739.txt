    reflect: fix Value.SetIterXXX to check for the read-only bit
    
    v.SetIterXXX(i) is semantically identical to v.Set(i.XXX()).
    If the latter panics for unexported values, so should the former.
    
    This change may breaking some programs, but the change is justified
    under the "Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs" document because
    the "library has a bug that violates the specification".
    In this case, the "reflect" package does not accurately match
    the behavior of the Go language specification.
    Also, this API was recently released, so the number of users
    who could be depending on this behavior is hopefully lower.
    
    Fixes #54628
