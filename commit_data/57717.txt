    cmd/link: reduce Wasm initial memory size
    
    Currently, for Wasm, the linker sets the initial memory size to
    the size of global data plus 16 MB. The intention is that it
    covers the global data and runtime initialization without growing
    the linear memory. However, the code accounts only the data
    "section", not the bss "section", therefore the extra 16 MB is
    actually used to cover bss variables. Also, as seen on the
    previous CL, the runtime actually didn't use the extra space,
    which means the program can start without that space.
    
    This CL corrects the global data size calculation, and reduces the
    extra to 1 MB. Currently the runtime's allocation pattern at
    startup is that it allocates a few pages for the page allocator's
    metadata, the an 8 MB reservation for the first 4 MB size, 4 MB
    aligned heap arena (it may be possible to reduce that, but we'll
    leave that for later). Here we use 1 MB extra space to cover the
    small allocations, but let the runtime allocate the heap arena, so
    the linker code and the runtime's allocator are not tightly
    coupled.
    
    For #69018.
