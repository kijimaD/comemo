    runtime: don't use GOGC in minimum sweep distance
    
    Currently, the minimum sweep distance is 1MB * GOGC/100. It's been
    this way since it was introduced in CL 13043 with no justification.
    
    Since there seems to be no good reason to scale the minimum sweep
    distance by GOGC, make the minimum sweep distance just 1MB.
