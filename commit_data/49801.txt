    cmd/compile/internal/escape: support OITAB and OCHECKNIL
    
    For interface method values, we nil check the receiver value at the
    point of evaluating the method value. Currently this is inserted by
    the backend during walk, but in some cases it's useful to emit them
    upfront instead.
    
    OITAB is essentially a field selection operation, like ODOT, OIDATA,
    and OSPTR.
    
    OCHECKNIL is a statement that simply evaluates its unary operand, and
    discards the result (after testing for nil).
