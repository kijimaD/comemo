    cmd/compile: mark DUFFZERO/DUFFCOPY as async unsafe
    
    These operations are async unsafe on architectures that use
    frame pointers.
    
    The reason is they rely on data being safe when stored below the stack
    pointer. They do:
    
      45da69:       48 89 6c 24 f0          mov    %rbp,-0x10(%rsp)
      45da6e:       48 8d 6c 24 f0          lea    -0x10(%rsp),%rbp
      45da73:       e8 7d d0 ff ff          callq  45aaf5 <runtime.duffzero+0x115>
      45da78:       48 8b 6d 00             mov    0x0(%rbp),%rbp
    
    This dance ensures that inside duffzero, it looks like there is a
    proper frame pointer set up, so that stack walkbacks work correctly if
    the kernel samples during duffzero.
    
    However, this instruction sequence depends on data not being clobbered
    even though it is below the stack pointer.
    
    If there is an async interrupt at any of those last 3 instructions,
    and the interrupt decides to insert a call to asyncPreempt, then the
    saved frame pointer on the stack gets clobbered. The last instruction
    above then restores junk to the frame pointer.
    
    To prevent this, mark these instructions as async unsafe.
    
    (The body of duffzero is already async unsafe, as it is in package runtime.)
