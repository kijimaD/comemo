    cmd/compile: don't inline fn with no shape params, but passed a shape arg
    
    Don't inline a function fn that has no shape parameters, but is passed
    at least one shape arg. This means we must be inlining a non-generic
    function fn that was passed into a generic function, and can be called
    with a shape arg because it matches an appropriate type parameter. But
    fn may include an interface conversion (that may be applied to a shape
    arg) that was not apparent when we first created the instantiation of
    the generic function. We can't handle this if we actually do the
    inlining, since we want to know all interface conversions immediately
    after stenciling.  So, we avoid inlining in this case.
    
    Fixes #49309.
