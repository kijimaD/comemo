commit 26cc10289f6e0dd2cebf0195f1351d6790ed7a9e

    net/http: escape contents of the directory indexes generated by FileServer
    
          Previously, filenames containing special characters could:
          1) Escape the <a> tag, with a file called something like: ">foo
          2) Break the links in the index by prematurely ending the path portion
          of the url, with a file called: foo?bar
    
          In order to avoid a forbidden dependency on the html package, I'm
          using htmlReplacer from net/http/server.go, which is equivalent to
          html.EscapeString.
    
          This change also expands fakeFile.Readdir to better emulate
    os.File.Readdir.
