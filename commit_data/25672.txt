    runtime: acquire stack lock in traceEvent
    
    traceEvent records system call events after a G has already entered
    _Gsyscall, which means the garbage collector could be installing stack
    barriers in the G's stack during the traceEvent. If traceEvent
    attempts to capture the user stack during this, it may observe a
    inconsistent stack barriers and panic. Fix this by acquiring the stack
    lock around the stack walk in traceEvent.
    
    Fixes #14101.
