    cmd/compile: collapse OffPtr sequences
    
    This triggers an astonishing 160k times
    during make.bash. The second biggest
    generic rewrite triggers 100k times.
    
    However, this is really just moving
    rewrites that were happening at the
    architecture level to the generic level.
