    strings: remove overengineered Compare implementation
    
    The function is here ONLY for symmetry with package bytes.
    This function should be used ONLY if it makes code clearer.
    It is not here for performance. Remove any performance benefit.
    
    If performance becomes an issue, the compiler should be fixed to
    recognize the three-way compare (for all comparable types)
    rather than encourage people to micro-optimize by using this function.
