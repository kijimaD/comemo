    runtime: drop stack-allocated pcvalueCaches
    
    Now that pcvalue keeps its cache on the M, we can drop all of the
    stack-allocated pcvalueCaches and stop carefully passing them around
    between lots of operations. This significantly simplifies a fair
    amount of code and makes several structures smaller.
    
    This series of changes has no statistically significant effect on any
    runtime Stack benchmarks.
    
    I also experimented with making the cache larger, now that the impact
    is limited to the M struct, but wasn't able to measure any
    improvements.
    
    This is a re-roll of CL 515277
