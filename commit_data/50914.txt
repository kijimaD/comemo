    misc/cgo/testsigfwd: move to runtime/testprog/testprogcgo
    
    This migrates testsigfwd, which uses some one-off build
    infrastructure, to be part of the runtime's testprogcgo.
    
    The test is largely unchanged. Because it's part of a larger binary,
    this CL renames a few things and gates the constructor-time signal
    handler registration on an environment variable. This CL also replaces
    an errant fmt.Errorf with fmt.Fprintf.
    
    For #37486, since it eliminates a non-go-test from dist.
