    crypto/cipher: execute AES-GCM decryption example
    
    The decryption example for AES-GCM was not executed, hiding the fact
    that the provided ciphertext could not be authenticated.
    
    This commit adds the required output comment, replaces the ciphertext
    with a working example, and removes an unnecessary string conversion
    along the way.
