    cmd/link: remove objIdx structure
    
    This indirection appears to be unnecessary for linking or linker debugging, and therefore hinders readability.
    
    Since all *oReaders are added to loader.objs *only* via the Preload -> addObj path, before any symbols are examined, there is no possible way the "i" member of this structure is still useful; and is likely a remnant of an earlier design.
