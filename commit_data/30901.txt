    cmd/go: exclude vendored packages from ... matches
    
    By overwhelming popular demand, exclude vendored packages from ... matches,
    by making ... never match the "vendor" element above a vendored package.
    
    go help packages now reads:
    
        An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more "..." wildcards,
        each of which can match any string, including the empty string and
        strings containing slashes.  Such a pattern expands to all package
        directories found in the GOPATH trees with names matching the
        patterns.
    
        To make common patterns more convenient, there are two special cases.
        First, /... at the end of the pattern can match an empty string,
        so that net/... matches both net and packages in its subdirectories, like net/http.
        Second, any slash-separted pattern element containing a wildcard never
        participates in a match of the "vendor" element in the path of a vendored
        package, so that ./... does not match packages in subdirectories of
        ./vendor or ./mycode/vendor, but ./vendor/... and ./mycode/vendor/... do.
        Note, however, that a directory named vendor that itself contains code
        is not a vendored package: cmd/vendor would be a command named vendor,
        and the pattern cmd/... matches it.
    
    Fixes #19090.
