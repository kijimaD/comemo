    cmd/{compile,link}: fix problem with DWARF end_sequence ops
    
    During DWARF line table emission in the linker, prior to issuing a
    DW_LNE_end_sequence op to mark the end of the line table for a
    compilation unit, advance the PC to produce an address beyond the last
    text address in the unit (this is required by the DWARF standard).
    Because of the way that GDB interprets end-sequence ops, we were
    effectively losing the last row in the line table for each unit, which
    degraded the debugging experience.
    
    This problem has been around for a while, but has surfaced recently
    due to changes in line table generation. Prior to Go 1.14, the DWARF
    line table was emitted entirely in the linker, and a single monolithic
    line table was created for each Go package (including functions from
    assembly). In 1.14 we moved to having the compiler emit line table
    fragments for each function, and having the linker stitch together the
    fragments. As part of this change we moved to a model in which each
    "go tool compile/asm" output has its own DWARF line table instance,
    meaning that there are many more "end sequence" ops, which made the
    problem more visible.
    
    Fixes #38192.
