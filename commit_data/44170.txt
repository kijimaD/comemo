    runtime: allocate fewer bytes during TestEINTR
    
    This will hopefully address the occasional "runtime: out of memory"
    failures observed on the openbsd-arm-jsing builder:
    https://build.golang.org/log/c296d866e5d99ba401b18c1a2ff3e4d480e5238c
    
    Also make the "spin" and "winch" loops concurrent instead of
    sequential to cut down the test's running time.
    
    Finally, change Block to coordinate by closing stdin instead of
    sending SIGINT. The SIGINT handler wasn't necessarily registered by
    the time the signal was sent.
