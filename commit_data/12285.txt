    spec: apply method sets, embedding to all types, not just named types
    
    When we first wrote the method set definition, we had long
    discussions about whether method sets applied to all types
    or just named types, and we (or at least I) concluded that it
    didn't matter: the two were equivalent points of view, because
    the only way to introduce a new method was to write a method
    function, which requires a named receiver type.
    
    However, the addition of embedded types changed this.
    Embedding can introduce a method without writing an explicit
    method function, as in:
    
            var x struct {
                    sync.Mutex
            }
    
            var px *struct {
                    sync.Mutex
            }
    
            var _, _ sync.Locker = &x, px
    
    The edits in this CL make clear that both &x and px satisfy
    sync.Locker.  Today, gccgo already works this way; 6g does not.
