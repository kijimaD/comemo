    encoding/json: always check resulting Go value for unmarshaling
    
    Even if an error occurs during unmarshal, check the resulting Go value.
    The documented API specifies no guarantees on how much of a Go value
    will be populated when an error occurs and the "json" package
    is technically not bounded by the Go compatibility agreement
    to ensure this behavior never changes.
    
    However, there is still value in running checks for
    what exactly what is partially mutated in the event of an error
    even if this is not guaranteed behavior.
