    cmd/ld: always mark tlsg STLSBSS
    
    Android apps build again.
    
    Defining TLSG in runtime/tls_arm.s gives it the type SNOPTRBSS, so its
    type was never being set when GOOS=android. I considered modifying the
    if statement, but I no longer understand the intention of the original
    change (in d738c6b0cad). We were always setting it before, what
    platform is this not valid for?
    
    Fixes #9829
