    log/slog: document atomicity guarantees and ordering limitations of handlers
    
    The new wording is slightly more strict than before in that
    it guarantees each Write only contains exactly one Record,
    while the previous wording opened up the possibility for
    multiple Records in a Write call.
    
    We also add a comment about the lack of sorting guarantees for
    concurrently logged Records. That is, the obtained lock only covers
    the Write call, rather than the combination of the call to time.Now,
    JSON/text serialization, and also the Write call.
