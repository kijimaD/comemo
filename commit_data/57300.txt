    cmd/dist: skip testing packages without tests in short test mode
    
    For short all.bash, we can keep the small speedup of 2-10 seconds by
    skipping 'go test' on packages without tests. This is viable without
    coverage loss since the Go release process is guaranteed to run long
    tests for all first class ports.
    
    For golang/go#60463.
