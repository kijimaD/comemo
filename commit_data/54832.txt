    cmd/dist: make registerTest take a goTest
    
    The overall goal is to make registerTest the primary entry point for
    adding dist tests and to convert nearly all dist tests to be
    represented by a goTest, registered via registerTest. This will
    centralize the logic for creating dist tests corresponding to go tool
    tests.
    
    I traced all exec calls from cmd/dist on linux/amd64 and this makes
    only no-op changes (such as re-arranging the order of flags).
    
    For #37486.
