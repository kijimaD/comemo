    syscall: fix finalizer fd close bugs in TestFcntlFlock and TestPassFD
    
    Currently, the syscall test suite takes very little time to run. It
    stands to reason that pretty much every time, zero GCs execute.
    
    With CL 309869, this changes because the minimum heap size is lowered,
    triggering two bugs in the test suite.
    
    One bug is in TestFcntlFlock, where a raw FD is wrapped in an os.File
    whose last reference is passed into a Cmd. That FD is then closed by a
    defer syscall.Close, instead of the os.File's Close, so the finalizer
    may fire *after* that FD has already been reused by another test.
    
    The second bug is in the child helper process of TestPassFD, where
    there's a small window in which a temp file's FD is encoded for an
    out-of-band unix domain socket message to the parent, but not yet sent.
    The point of encoding is also the last reference that FD's os.File, so a
    finalizer may run at any time. While it's safe for the finalizer to run
    after the FD is sent, if it runs before, the send will fail, since unix
    domain sockets require that any sent FDs are valid.
