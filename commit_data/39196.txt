    testing: callerName only needs one PC in the traceback
    
    callerName requested 2 PCs from Callers, and that causes
    both to be looked up in the file/line mapping.
    We really only need to do the work for one PC.
    (And in fact the caller doesn't need file/line at all, but
    the Callers API can't express that.)
    
    We used to request 2 PCs because in 1.11 and earlier we
    stored an inline skip count in the second entry.
    That's not necessary any more (as of 1.12).
    
    Fixes #32093
