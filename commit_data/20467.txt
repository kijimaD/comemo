    runtime: avoid read overrun in heapdump
    
    Start the stack a few words below the actual top, so that
    if something tries to read goexit's caller PC from the stack,
    it won't fault on a bad memory address.
    Today, heapdump does that.
    Maybe tomorrow, traceback or something else will do that.
    Make it not a bug.
