    reflect: document equality guarantee for Type
    
    The only previous mention of this property was in the String() method.
    Since this is the only way to uniquely identify a type and we can't
    change this property without breaking the Go 1 guarantee, it seems
    better to document this property than hiding it on a method.
    
    Fixes #16348
