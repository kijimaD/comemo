    cmd/asm: fix parsing of the s390x VLE{G,F,H,B} instructions
    
    This commit makes the assembler frontend reorder the operands so that
    they are in the order the backend expects. The index should be first
    for consistency with the other vector instructions.
    
    Before this commit no operand order would have been accepted so this
    isn't a breaking change.
