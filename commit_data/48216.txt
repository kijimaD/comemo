    cmd/compile: emit types of constants which are instantiated generic types
    
    Normally types of constants are emitted when the type is defined (an
    ODCLTYPE). However, the types of constants where the type is an
    instantiated generic type made inside the constant declaration, do not
    normally get emitted. But the DWARF processor in the linker wants
    to see those types. So we emit them during stenciling.
    
    Fixes #51245
