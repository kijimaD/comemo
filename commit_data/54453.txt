    os/exec: fix edge cases in Windows PATH resolution
    
    - Ignore empty entries in PATH, like PowerShell does.
    
    - If we resolve a path using an explicit relative entry in PATH,
      treat it the same as we do for the implicit "." search path,
      by allowing a later (absolute) PATH entry that resolves to the
      same executable to return the absolute version of its path.
    
    - If the requested path does not end with an extension matching
      PATHEXT, return ErrNotFound (indicating that we potentially searched
      for multiple alternatives and did not find one) instead of
      ErrNotExist (which would imply that we know the exact intended path
      but couldn't find it).
    
    Fixes #61493.
