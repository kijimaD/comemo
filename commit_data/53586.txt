    all: use go/parser.SkipObjectResolution in more places
    
    None of cgo, "go test", nor srcimporter make use of go/ast's object
    resolution via go/ast.Object. As such, we can skip that work during
    parse time, which should save some CPU time.
    
    We don't have any benchmark numbers, as none of the three packages have
    any usable benchmarks, but we measured gofmt to be about 5% faster
    thanks to this tweak in https://go.dev/cl/401454.
    These three packages are quite different to gofmt, but one can expect
    similar speed-ups in the 1-5% range.
    
    Two notable exceptions, which do make use of go/ast.Object, are cmd/fix
    and cmd/doc - we do not modify those here.
    
    See #46485.
