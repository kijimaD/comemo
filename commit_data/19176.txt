commit 0de521d111b88b2bc6466a4e1f29a8a284c0b3ee

    go/scanner: interpret //line directives sans filename sensibly, second try.
    
    A //line directive without a filename now denotes the empty
    filename, not the current directory (the Go 1.2 behaviour) nor
    the previous //line's filename (the behaviour since CL
    86990044).
    
    They should never appear (but they do, e.g. due to a bug in godoc).
    
    Fixes #7765
