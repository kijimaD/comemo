commit 1f7e55e418659dc3b5fe66792b85807a7065144f
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    path, path/filepath: add Join example with joined rooted path
    
    This makes clear that Go's path.Join and filepath.Join are different
    from the Python os.path.join (and perhaps others).
    
    Requested in private mail.
