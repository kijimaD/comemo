commit 1d687c742ddad0be83314019c03e17bad7235535
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 18 09:41:32 2011 -0400

    gc: add delete(m, x) but leave in m[x] = 0, false.
    
    The old m[x] = 0, false syntax will be deleted
    in a month or so, once people have had time to
    change their code (there is a gofix in a separate CL).
