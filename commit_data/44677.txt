    time: support "," as separator for fractional seconds
    
    Accepts comma "," as a separator for fractional seconds
    hence we now accept:
    * 2006-01-02 15:04:05,999999999 -0700 MST
    * Mon Jan _2 15:04:05,120007 2006
    * Mon Jan 2 15:04:05,120007 2006
    
    This change follows the recommendations of ISO 8601 per
    
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#cite_note-26
    
    which states
    
       ISO 8601:2004(E), ISO, 2004-12-01, "4.2.2.4 ...
       the decimal fraction shall be divided from the integer
       part by the decimal sign specified in ISO 31-0, i.e.
       the comma [,] or full stop [.]. Of these, the comma
       is the preferred sign."
    
    Unfortunately, I couldn't directly access the ISO 8601 document
    because suddenly it is behind a paywall on the ISO website,
    charging CHF 158 (USD 179) for 38 pages :-(
    
    However, this follows publicly available cited literature, as well
    as the recommendations from the proposal approval.
