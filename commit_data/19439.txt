    cmd/cgo: explicitly state that #cgo directives across multiple files are concatenated
    
    This is a quick documentation change/clarification, as this
    confused me before: in my own cgo-based projects, I currently have
    identical #cgo directives in each relevant source file, and I notice
    with go build -x that cgo is combining the directives, leading to
    pkg-config invocations with the same package name (gtk+-3.0, in my
    case) repeated several times, or on Mac OS X, LDFLAGS listing
    -framework Foundation -framework AppKit multiple times. Since I am
    about to add a CFLAGS as well, I checked the source to cmd/cgo and
    go/build (where the work is actually done) to see if that still holds
    true there. Hopefully other people who have made the same mistake I
    have (I don't know if anyone has) can remove the excess declarations
    now; this should make things slightly easier to manage as well.
