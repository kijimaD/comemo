    runtime: document the G states
    
    In particular, write down the rules for stack ownership because the
    details of this are about to get very important with concurrent stack
    shrinking. (Interestingly, the details don't actually change, but
    anything that's currently skating on thin ice is likely to fall
    through.)
    
    Fox #12967.
