    runtime/pprof: write heap statistics to heap profile always
    
    The heap statistics were only written if asked for a profile with debug > 0,
    but that also prints a stack trace for each profile line, which is comparatively
    much noisier. The statistics are short enough and separate enough
    (they only appear at the end) and useful enough that we can print them
    always.
    
    This means that people using -test.memprofile in tests will get a memory
    profile with statistics included now. Pprof won't care, but if people care to
    look, the numbers will be there.
    
    This avoids the need for hacks like using -memprofilerate=1 to find
    the number of allocations.
