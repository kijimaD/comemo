    cmd/dist: don't fail when Mercurial is a batch file on Windows
    
    On windows Mercurial installed with easy_install typically creates
    an hg.bat batch file in Python Scripts directory, which cannot be used
    with CreateProcess unless full path is specified. Work around by
    launching hg via cmd.exe /c.
    
    Additionally, fix a rare FormatMessageW crash.
    
    Fixes #3093.
