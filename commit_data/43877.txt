    doc/go1.16: consolidate stdlib changes in "Minor changes" section
    
    Many of the standard library changes that were added before CL 272871
    ended up in the "Core library" section. That section is meant for
    major changes like new packages, and most of these aren't.
    
    Consolidate all changes in the "Minor changes to the library" section
    for now, so that it's easier to get a complete picture of changes for
    each package, along with the remaining TODOs. Add a TODO to read them
    over at the end and factor out items that are worth highlighting.
    
    Apply minor other fixups to improve consistency.
    
    For #40700.
