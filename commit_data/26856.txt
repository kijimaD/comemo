    cmd/link: skip allocation when reading symbol name
    
    The object file reader in cmd/link reads the symbol name into a scratch
    []byte, converts it to a string, and then does a substring replacement.
    Instead, this CL does the replacement on the []byte into the scratch
    space and then creates the final string.
    
    Linking godoc without DWARF, best of ten, shows a ~10% improvement.
    
    tip:           real 0m1.099s user 0m1.541s
    this:          real 0m0.990s user 0m1.280s
    
    This is part of an attempt to make suffixarray string deduping
    come out as a wash, but it's not there yet:
    
    cl/19987:      real 0m1.335s user 0m1.794s
    cl/19987+this: real 0m1.225s user 0m1.540s
