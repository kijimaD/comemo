    doc/contribute.html: clean up HTML and formatting
    
    Mostly just formatting and minor cleanup:
    
    - regularize HTML (add </p> etc.)
    - remove all errors caught by tidy
    - start all sentences on new line for easy editing
    
    Some wording changes, but there will be more to come.
    It seemed there were already enough edits to send it out.
    
    Update #24487
