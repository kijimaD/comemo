    os/signal, runtime: implement notes on Plan 9
    
    This change is an implementation of the signal
    runtime and os/signal package on Plan 9.
    
    Contrary to Unix, on Plan 9 a signal is called
    a note and is represented by a string.
    
    For this reason, the sigsend and signal_recv
    functions had to be reimplemented specifically
    for Plan 9.
    
    In order to reuse most of the code and internal
    interface of the os/signal package, the note
    strings are mapped to integers.
    
    Thanks to Russ Cox for the early review.
