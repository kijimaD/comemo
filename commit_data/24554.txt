    cmd/link: centralize knowledge of size of fixed part of stack
    
    Shared libraries on ppc64le will require a larger minimum stack frame (because
    the ABI mandates that the TOC pointer is available at 24(R1)). Part 2b of
    preparing for that is to have all the code in the linker that needs to know
    this size of this call a function to find out.
