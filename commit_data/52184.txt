    cmd/link: don't sort pclntab entries
    
    They are already in a good order. The sort here does nothing, as
    all the SymValues are 0. Sorting just arbitrarily permutes items
    because everything is equal and the sort isn't stable.
    
    Not sure why the ordering of these symbols matter. That ordering was
    added in CL 243223.
