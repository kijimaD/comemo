    net/http: deflake TestServerAllowsBlockingRemoteAddr more
    
    As noted in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19161#issuecomment-287554171,
    CL 37771 (adding use of the new httptest.Server.Client to all net/http
    tests) accidentally reverted DisableKeepAlives for this test. For
    many tests, DisableKeepAlives was just present to prevent goroutines
    from staying active after the test exited.  In this case it might
    actually be important. (We'll see)
    
    Updates #19161
