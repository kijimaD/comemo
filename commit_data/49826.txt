    cmd/compile/internal/noder: prune unified IR's dictionary logic
    
    Unified IR uses static dictionaries for some itabs and function/method
    expressions, and they're roughly the right idea. But at the same time,
    they're actually somewhat brittle and I need to reorganize some ideas
    anyway to get shaped-based stenciling working. So this CL just rips
    them out entirely.
    
    Note: the code for emitting runtime dictionaries with *runtime._type
    symbols is still present, and continues to demonstrate that basic
    runtime dictionary handling is working.
