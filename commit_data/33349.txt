    cmd/vet: accept package config from go command
    
    This CL adds support for accepting package config from
    the go command. Paired with CL 74356 this lets us make
    sure vet has complete information about package sources.
    This fixes many issues (see CL 74356 for the list), including
    mishandling of cgo and vendoring.
