    internal/txtar: bring back to main repo, for tests in std
    
    This used to be cmd/go/internal/txtar,
    and then it was moved to golang.org/x/tools/txtar
    and revendored from there into cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/tools/txtar.
    
    We have a use for txtar in a new test in the standard library,
    which cannot access cmd/vendor. But we also don't really want
    to vendor it into the standard library as is, because that would
    be the first vendoring of x/tools in std, and it would be better
    to keep std separate from x/tools, even for testing.
    
    Instead, since a little copying is better than a little dependency,
    just make a copy in internal/txtar. The package does not change.
    
    Having done that, replace the uses in cmd/go so that there's
    only one copy in the main repo.
