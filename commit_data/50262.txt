    go/types: test shifts that are disabled in shared test file
    
    CL 425735 consolidated the testdata/check/shifts.go files between
    go/types and types2. Because some shifts don't work correctly with
    types2, the corresponding tests were disabled in the shared file.
    Make sure we keep testing those shifts for go/types by adding a
    local test file.
    
    For #52080.
    For #54511.
