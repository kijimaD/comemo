    cmd/trace: also show end stack traces
    
    Fix a regression that appeared in 1.23 when it comes to the stack traces
    shown in the trace viewer. In 1.22 and earlier, the viewer was always
    showing end stack traces. In 1.23 and later the viewer started to
    exclusively show start stack traces.
    
    Showing only the start stack traces made it impossible to see the last
    stack trace produced by a goroutine. It also made it hard to understand
    why a goroutine went off-cpu, as one had to hunt down the next running
    slice of the same goroutine.
    
    Emit end stack traces in addition to start stack traces to fix the
    issue.
    
    Fixes #70570
