    crypto/x509: don't add an AuthorityKeyId to self-signed certificates.
    
    The AuthorityKeyId is optional for self-signed certificates, generally
    useless, and takes up space. This change causes an AuthorityKeyId not to
    be added to self-signed certificates, although it can still be set in
    the template if the caller really wants to include it.
    
    Fixes #15194.
