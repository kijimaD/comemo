    cmd/go: guarantee all test output is on stdout
    
    In past releases, whether test output appears on stdout or stderr
    has varied depending on exactly how go test was invoked and
    also (indefensibly) on the number of CPUs available.
    Standardize on standard output for all test output.
    This is easy to explain and makes go test | go tool test2json work nicely.
