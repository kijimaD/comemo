    runtime: don't use systemstack for BeforeFork/AfterFork
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/140930043 syscall.BeforeFork was changed to
    call beforefork via onM. This was done because at the time BeforeFork
    was written in C but was called from Go. While the runtime was being
    converted to Go, calls to complex C functions used onM to ensure that
    enough stack space was available.
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/172260043 the syscall.BeforeFork and
    beforefork functions were rewritten into Go. In this rewrite
    syscall.BeforeFork continue to call beforefork via onM, although
    because both functions were now in Go that was no longer necessary.
    
    In https://golang.org/cl/174950043 onM was renamed to systemstack,
    producing essentially the code we have today.
    
    Therefore, the use of systemstack in syscall.BeforeFork (and
    syscall.AfterFork) is a historical relic.  Remove it.
