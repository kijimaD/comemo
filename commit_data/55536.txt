    runtime,internal/syscall/windows: remove long path support check
    
    The runtime currently enables long path support process-wide by updating
    the process environment block (PEB). It then tries to create a file
    using a long path to check if the PEB update made any difference.
    
    There hasn't been any report that the PEB update was not effective,
    and the check itself is quite tricky, so it's time to remove it.
    
    While here, linkname `runtime.canUseLongPaths` to a variable in
    internal/syscall/windows instead of the os package so it is easier to
    consume from other packages.
