    [dev.garbage] runtime: add stackfreelist
    
    The freelist for normal objects and the freelist
    for stacks share the same mspan field for holding
    the list head but are operated on by different code
    sequences. This overloading complicates the use of bit
    vectors for allocation of normal objects. This change
    refactors the use of the stackfreelist out from the
    use of freelist.
