    gc: fix arm build
    
    Escape analysis was incorrectly assuming that
    functions without bodies don't leak their
    parameters.  This meant that sync/atomic's
    TestAddInt64 was allocating x on its stack,
    and then x was not properly aligned for use
    with the atomic 64-bit instructions.  Obviously
    we should figure out the alignment story on 5g
    too, but this fix is correct and should restore the
    build to 'ok'.
