    godashboard: fix utf-8 in user names
    
    Also standardize on 'utf8' as encoding name.
    Apparently either is acceptable.
    
    The user, because it is a StringProperty,
    must be of type unicode in order to handle
    Unicode correctly.  It must *not* have type string.
    
    The desc, because it is a BlobProperty, must
    be of type string in order to handle Unicode correctly.
    It must *not* have type unicode.
    
    Yay encoding type pedantry without static typing.
