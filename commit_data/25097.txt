    spec: minor adjustment of prose in composite literal section
    
    The prose discussing composite literals referred to the composite
    literal type with 'LiteralType', denoting the literal type's EBNF
    production explicitly. Changed 'LiteralType' to 'literal type' to
    remove the literal (no pun intended) connection and instead mean
    the underlying type. Seems a simpler and more readable change
    than referring to the underlying type everywhere explicitly.
    
    Fixes #12717.
