    net: delete TestListenCloseListen
    
    In CL 557177, I attempted to fix a logical race in this test (#65175).
    However, I introduced a data race in the process (#65209).
    
    The race was reported on the windows-amd64-race builder. When I tried
    to reproduce it on linux/amd64, I added a time.Sleep in the Accept
    loop. However, that Sleep causes the test to fail outright with
    EADDRINUSE, which suggests that my earlier guess about the open Conn
    preventing reuse of the port was, in fact, incorrect.
    
    On some platforms we could instead use SO_REUSEPORT and avoid closing
    the first Listener entirely, but that wouldn't be even remotely in the
    spirit of the original test.
    
    Since I don't see a way to preserve the test in a way that is not
    inherently flaky / racy, I suggest that we just delete it. It was
    originally added as a regression test for a bug in the nacl port,
    which no longer exists anyway. (Some of that code may live on in the
    wasm port, but it doesn't seem worth maintaining a flaky
    port-independent test to maintain a regression test for a bug specific
    to secondary platforms.)
    
    Fixes #65209.
    Updates #65175.
