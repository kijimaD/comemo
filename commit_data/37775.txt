    cmd/go: fix -n output in runtime/internal/atomic
    
    When building runtime/internal/atomic, the toolchain writes a symabis2
    file. This file is read back in, filtered, and appended to the symabis
    file. This breaks with -n, since the symabis2 file is never written.
    
    With this change, when -n is used, an equivalent "grep" command is
    printed instead. The output for -x is unchanged.
    
    Fixes #29346
