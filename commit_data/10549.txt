    encoding/asn1: fix test on OpenBSD
    
    time.Parse uses time.Local if it has the right zone offset,
    otherwise it calls time.FixedZone.  The test's use of reflect.DeepEqual
    meant that the test expected time.FixedZone always, failing
    when the local time zone really would have used -0700 for
    that time.  The fix is to format the time to display only the
    pieces we intend to test.
