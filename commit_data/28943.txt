    runtime: update heap profile stats after world is started
    
    Updating the heap profile stats is one of the most expensive parts of
    mark termination other than stack rescanning, but there's really no
    need to do this with the world stopped. Move it to right after we've
    started the world back up. This creates a *very* small window where
    allocations from the next cycle can slip into the profile, but the
    exact point where mark termination happens is so non-deterministic
    already that a slight reordering here is unimportant.
