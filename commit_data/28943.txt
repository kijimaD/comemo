    crypto/x509: return error for missing SerialNumber.
    
    If the SerialNumber is nil in the template then the resulting panic is
    rather deep in encoding/asn1 and it's not obvious what went wrong.
    
    This change tests and returns a more helpful error in this case.
    
    Fixes #16603.
