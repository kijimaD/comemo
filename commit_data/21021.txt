    cmd/objdump, cmd/pprof: factor disassembly into cmd/internal/objfile
    
    Moving so that new Go 1.4 pprof can use it.
    
    The old 'GNU objdump workalike' mode for 'go tool objdump'
    is now gone, as are the tests for that mode. It was used only
    by pre-Go 1.4 pprof. You can still specify an address range on
    the command line; you just get the same output format as
    you do when dumping the entire binary (without an address
    limitation).
