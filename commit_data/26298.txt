    regexp/syntax: fix factoring of common prefixes in alternations
    
    In the past, `a.*?c|a.*?b` was factored to `a.*?[bc]`. Thus, given
    "abc" as its input string, the automaton would consume "ab" and
    then stop (when unanchored) whereas it should consume all of "abc"
    as per leftmost semantics.
    
    Fixes #13812.
