    cmd/dist: run vet/all on dedicated builders
    
    We will soon add dedicated builders for running vet/all.
    Their name will end with "-vetall".
    On those builders, run vet/all and nothing else.
    On all other builders, including local all.bash,
    don't run vet/all at all, because it is slow.
    
    This will probably be refined more over time.
