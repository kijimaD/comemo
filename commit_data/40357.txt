    net: convert TestTCPServer to use subtests
    
    My fix in CL 202618 inadvertently violated an invariant in the inner
    loop of TestTCPServer (namely, that len(trchs) == i). That causes a
    panic when one or more of the channels is omitted due to a flake.
    
    Instead of trying to fix up the test, let's just factor out a subtest
    and skip the whole thing if the transceiver's Dial flakes out.
    
    Updates #32919
