    cmd/gc: slightly better code generation
    
    * Avoid treating CALL fn(SB) as justification for introducing
    and tracking a registerized variable for fn(SB).
    
    * Remove USED(n) after declaration and zeroing of n.
    It was left over from when the compiler emitted more
    aggressive set and not used errors, and it was keeping
    the optimizer from removing a redundant zeroing of n
    when n was a pointer or integer variable.
    
    Update #597.
