    cmd/link: split text sections for arm 32-bit
    
    This CL is a roll-forward (tweaked slightly) of CL 467715, which
    turned on text section splitting for GOARCH=arm. The intent is to
    avoid recurrent problems with external linking where there is a
    disagreement between the Go linker and the external linker over
    whether a given branch will reach. In the past our approach has been
    to tweak the reachability calculations slightly to try to work around
    potential linker problems, but this hasn't proven to be very robust;
    section splitting seems to offer a better long term fix.
    
    Fixes #58425.
