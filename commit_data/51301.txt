    syscall: in TestDirent, make as many ReadDirent calls as are needed
    
    ReadDirent returns only as many directory entries as will fit in the
    buffer, and each entry is variable-length â€” so we have no guarantee in
    general that a buffer of a given arbitrary size can hold even one
    entry, let alone all ten entries expected by the test.
    
    Instead, iterate calls to ReadDirent until one of the calls returns
    zero entries and no error, indicating that the directory has been read
    to completion.
    
    Fixes #37323
