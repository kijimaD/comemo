    runtime: ensure forward progress when unwinding an arm stack frame
    
    The arm gentraceback mishandled frame linkage values pointing
    to the assembly return function.  This function is special as
    its frame size is zero and it contains only one instruction.
    These conditions would preserve the frame pointer and result
    in an off by one error when unwinding the caller.
    
    Fixes #5124
