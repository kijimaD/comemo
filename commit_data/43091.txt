    [dev.link] cmd/link: parallelize reloc sym
    
    I tried a couple of different architectures (goroutine per symbol, 8
    goroutines handling symbols from channels, and this architecture), and
    this was the best. Another possible approach could be to divide up the
    space of relocations, forgo the channels, and just pass slices to the
    relocation routines, which would possibly be faster.
    
    Reloc                     13.9ms ± 5%      9.0ms ±10%       -35.09%  (p=0.000 n=8+9)
