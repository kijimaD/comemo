    cmd/go: make file:line for cgo files look like non-cgo files
    
    Passing the absolute path to cgo puts the absolute path in the
    generated file's //line directives, which then shows that path
    in the compiler output, which the go command can then
    make relative to the current directory, same as it does for
    other compiler output.
