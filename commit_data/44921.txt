    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of errors.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/errors.go
    and errors.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker.
    
    The go/types version is significantly different as it handles
    error codes but doesn't have some of the types2 changes.
