    testing: synchronize writes to the root's Writer
    
    Prior to this change it was possible to see interleaved messages:
    <<<
    === RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName48
    === RUN   Test/LongLon=== RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName50
    gLongLongName49
    === RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName51
    >>>
    
    This change fixes it such that you see:
    <<<
    === RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName48
    === RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName49
    === RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName50
    === RUN   Test/LongLongLongLongName51
    >>>
    
    Fixes #18741
