    cmd/compile: don't generate algs for map buckets
    
    Note that this is only safe because
    the compiler generates multiple distinct
    gc.Types. If we switch to having canonical
    gc.Types, then this will need to be updated
    to handle the case in which the user uses both
    map[T]S and also map[[8]T]S. In that case,
    the runtime needs algs for [8]T, but this could
    mark the sole [8]T type as Noalg. This is a general
    problem with having a single bool to represent
    whether alg generation is needed for a type.
    
    Cuts 5k off cmd/go and 22k off golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc,
    approx 0.04% and 0.12% respectively.
    
    For #6853 and #9930
