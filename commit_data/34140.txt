    crypto/elliptic: fix incomplete addition used in CombinedMult on s390x
    
    This applies the amd64-specific changes from CL 42611 to the s390x P256
    implementation. The s390x implementation was disabled in CL 62292 and
    this CL re-enables it.
    
    Adam Langley's commit message from CL 42611:
    
    The optimised P-256 includes a CombinedMult function, which doesn't do
    dual-scalar multiplication, but does avoid an affine conversion for
    ECDSA verification.
    
    However, it currently uses an assembly point addition function that
    doesn't handle exceptional cases.
    
    Fixes #20215.
