    [dev.link] cmd/link: don't truncate external relocation type
    
    In CL 222244, we store external relocations in the same format as
    Go object files. In Go object file format, the relocation type is
    a uint8. However, for external relocations the type may not
    always fit in a uint8. Truncating it will result in a bad
    relocation. Fix this by storing the external reloc type on the
    side. (An alternative is to extend the Go object file format to
    use a uint16, but it is not necessary for Go relocations and
    will waste some binary size.)
    
    Fix ARM build.
