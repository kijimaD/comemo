    codereview: give up on http fetch after 30 seconds
    
    If Python blocks in the SSL handshake it seems to be
    completely uninterruptible, and I've been seeing it
    block for at least hours recently. I don't know if the
    problem is on the client side or the server side or
    somewhere in the network, but setting the timeout
    at least means you're guaranteed a new shell prompt
    (after printing some errors).
