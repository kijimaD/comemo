    cmd/godoc: fix minor bug in FormatSelections.
    
    FormatSelections tries to call a nil function value if lw is nil
    and the final entry in the selections array is non-nil. Luckily,
    this doesn't actually happen in practice since godoc doesn't use
    this combination (no line numbers, but with selections).
