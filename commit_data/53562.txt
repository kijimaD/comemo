    runtime: don't race cmd.Wait and cmd.StdoutPipe read
    
    os/exec.Cmd.Wait closes the read end of os/exec.Cmd.StdoutPipe, meaning
    that io.ReadAll can return fs.ErrClosed if the child exits too early,
    allowing Wait to complete. The StdoutPipe docs already note this sharp
    edge.
    
    Move cmd.Wait until after we finish waiting on stdout. If the child
    crashes for some reason, the write end of the pipe will implicitly close
    causing io.ReadAll to return as well, so we won't get stuck.
    
    Fixes #52725.
