    testing: remove tests from the running log while they are waiting on parallel subtests
    
    The parallel subtests are themselves removed from the running map
    while they are blocked on calls to t.Parallel, so it is misleading to
    log their parents as if they are running when we know they cannot be
    making any kind of meaningful progress.
    
    Fixes #64404.
