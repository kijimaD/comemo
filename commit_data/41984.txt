    cmd/compile: not use REGTMP in ZeroRange on ARM64
    
    For async preemption, we will be using REGTMP as a temporary
    register in injected call on ARM64, which will clobber it. So any
    code that uses REGTMP is not safe for async preemption.
    
    For ZeroRange, which is inserted at the function entry where
    there is no register live, we could just use a different register
    and avoid REGTMP.
