    runtime: correct misplaced right brace in Linux SIGBUS handling
    
    I'm not sure how to write a test for this.  The change in
    behaviour is that if you somehow get a SIGBUS signal for an
    address >= 0x1000, the program will now crash rather than
    calling panic.  As far as I know, on x86 GNU/Linux, the only
    way to get a SIGBUS (rather than a SIGSEGV) is to set the
    stack pointer to an invalid value.
