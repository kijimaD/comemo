    cmd/compile/internal/types2: review of stmt.go
    
    The changes between (equivalent, and reviewed) go/types/stmt.go
    and stmt.go can be seen by comparing patchset 1 and 2. The actual
    changes are removing the "// UNREVIEWED" marker, and minor adjustments
    to get the code slightly closer to go/types/stmt.go.
    
    The primary differences compared to go/types are:
    - use of syntax rather than go/ast package, with significant
      differences in the representation of switch and select statements,
      range clauses of for statements, and inc/dec statements.
    - no reporting of error codes
    - use or error_ for collecting addition error information
