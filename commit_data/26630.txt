    cmd/dist: accept "//+build" with no spaces, like go/build
    
    The go/build parser accepts "//+build", with no spaces.
    Make the cmd/dist bootstrap parser do the same.
    While in theory we should always use the space form,
    I copied some code that did not into the standard tree,
    and I was very confused that 'go test' had had no problem
    but then make.bash died.
    
    (As a reminder, cmd/dist does not use go/build because
    cmd/dist must build against earlier versions of Go.)
