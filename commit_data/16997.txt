    misc/dist: don't ship cmd/api
    
    cmd/api is a tool to prevent the Go developers from breaking
    the Go 1 API promise. It has no utility to end users and
    doesn't run on arbitrary packages (it's always been full of
    hacks for its bespoke type checker to work on the standard
    library)
    
    Robert's in-progress rewrite depends on the go.tools repo for
    go/types, so we won't be able to ship this tool later
    anyway. Just remove it from binary distributions.
    
    A future change to run.bash can conditionally build & run
    cmd/api, perhaps automatically fetching go/types if
    necessary. I assume people don't want to vendor go/types into
    a private gopath just for cmd/api.
    
    I will need help with run.bat.
