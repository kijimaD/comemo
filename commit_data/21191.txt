    cmd/9g: don't use R13
    
    R13 is the C TLS pointer.  Once we're calling to and from C code, if
    we clobber R13 in our code, sigtramp won't know whether to get the
    current g from REGG or from C TLS.  The simplest solution is for Go
    code to preserve the C TLS pointer.  This is equivalent to what other
    platforms do, except that on other platforms the TLS pointer is in a
    special register.
