    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile/internal/ssa: distinguish exit and return blocks
    
    It is confusing to have exceptional edges jump back into
    real code.  Distinguish return blocks, which execute acutal
    code, and the exit block, which is a merge point for the regular
    and exceptional return flow.
    
    Prevent critical edge insertion from adding blocks on edges
    into the exit block.  These added blocks serve no purpose and
    add a bunch of dead jumps to the assembly output.  Furthermore,
    live variable analysis is confused by these jumps.
