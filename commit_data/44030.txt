    [dev.link] cmd/link: remove elderly ld bug workaround on arm64
    
    The arm64 archreloc method contains a workaround for a 2015-era
    binutils/linker bug, https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18270.
    This bug has been fixed for some time now, so remove the workaround
    for it (the workaround includes some code that mutates a relocation
    type, which is something we want to void doing in the new linker).
