    cmd/compile: add -env key=value flag
    
    This flag is not terribly useful with the go command, which will pass
    all environment variables through to subprocesses it invokes,
    but it can be useful in other build systems, notably blaze and bazel,
    to pass compiler-debugging variables like GOSSAFUNC through to
    the compiler.
    
    We have been maintaining this as a patch against Google's internal
    toolchain for many years, and it has proven useful in those non-go-command
    contexts.
