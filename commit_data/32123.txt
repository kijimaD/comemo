    runtime: remove unused prefetch functions
    
    The only non test user of the assembler prefetch functions is the
    heapBits.prefetch function which is itself unused.
    
    The runtime prefetch functions have no functionality on most platforms
    and are not inlineable since they are written in assembler. The function
    call overhead eliminates the performance gains that could be achieved with
    prefetching and would degrade performance for platforms where the functions
    are no-ops.
    
    If prefetch functions are needed back again later they can be improved
    by avoiding the function call overhead and implementing them as intrinsics.
