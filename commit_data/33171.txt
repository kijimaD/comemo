    net/http: improve signature of Redirect, NewRequest
    
    In CL https://golang.org/cl/4893043 (6 years ago), a new package named
    "url" was created (it is currently known as "net/url"). During that
    change, some identifier name collisions were introduced, and two
    parameters in net/http were renamed to "urlStr".
    
    Since that time, Go has continued to put high emphasis on the quality
    and readability of the documentation. Sometimes, that means making small
    sacrifices in the implementation details of a package to ensure that
    the godoc reads better, since that's what the majority of users interact
    with. See https://golang.org/s/style#named-result-parameters:
    
    > Clarity of docs is always more important than saving a line or two
    > in your function.
    
    I think the "urlStr" parameter name is suboptimal for godoc purposes,
    and just "url" would be better.
    
    During the review of https://golang.org/cl/4893043, it was also noted
    by @rsc that having to rename parameters named "url" was suboptimal:
    
    > It's unfortunate that naming the package url means
    > you can't have a parameter or variable named url.
    
    However, at the time, the name of the url package was still being
    decided, and uri was an alternative name under consideration.
    The reason urlStr was chosen is because it was a lesser evil
    compared to naming the url package uri instead:
    
    > Let's not get hung up on URI vs. URL, but I'd like s/uri/urlStr/ even for just
    > that the "i" in "uri" looks very similar to the "l" in "url" in many fonts.
    
    > Please let's go with urlStr instead of uri.
    
    Now that we have the Go 1 compatibility guarantee, the name of the
    net/url package is fixed. However, it's possible to improve the
    signature of Redirect, NewRequest functions in net/http package
    for godoc purposes by creating a package global alias to url.Parse,
    and renaming urlStr parameter to url in the exported funcs. This CL
    does so.
    
    Updates #21077.
