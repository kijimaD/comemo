    runtime, cmd/go: roll back stale message, test detail
    
    Some debugging code was recently added to:
    1) provide more detail for the stale reason when it is
    determined that a package is stale
    2) provide file and package time and date information when
    it is determined that runtime.a is stale
    
    This backs out those those debugging messages.
    
    Fixes #19116
