    cmd/go: print all test flags in "go test -h"
    
    Originally 'go test -h' printed the output of 'go help test'.
    Then issue #6576 was filed, because that output didn't list (for example) -bench.
    CL 14502065 changed 'go test -h' to print the output of 'go help testflag'.
    Then issue #9209 was filed, because that output didn't list (for example) -c.
    
    To print all the relevant flags, parts of both 'go help test' and 'go help testflag'
    are needed. Refactor the help messages to make those parts available
    and print them.
    
    Fixes #9209.
