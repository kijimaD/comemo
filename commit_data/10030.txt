    godoc: fix ToAbsolute mapping
    
    The implementation of splitFirst was broken;
    splitFirst("foo/") must be the same as splitFirst("foo").
    As a result, ToAbsolute could be simplified, and as a side
    effect this fixes a long-standing bug.
    
    Thanks to Luca Greco <luca.greco@alcacoop.it> for doing
    the investigation.
    
    Fixes #1157.
