    archive/zip: improve BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage
    
    Before this CL:
    
    $ go test -bench=CompressedZipGarbage -count=5 -run=NONE archive/zip
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8        50  20677087 ns/op   42973 B/op      47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8       100  20584764 ns/op   24294 B/op      47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8        50  20859221 ns/op   42973 B/op      47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8       100  20901176 ns/op   24294 B/op      47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8        50  21282409 ns/op   42973 B/op      47 allocs/op
    
    The B/op number is effectively meaningless. There
    is a surprisingly large one-time cost that gets
    divided by the number of iterations that your
    machine can get through in a second.
    
    This CL discards the first run, which helps.
    It is not a panacea. Running with -benchtime=10s
    will allow the sync.Pool to be emptied,
    which brings the problem back.
    However, since there are more iterations to divide
    the cost through, it’s not quite as bad,
    and running with a high benchtime is rare.
    
    This CL changes the meaning of the B/op number,
    which is unfortunate, since it won’t have the
    same order of magnitude as previous Go versions.
    But it wasn’t really comparable before anyway,
    since it didn’t have any reliable meaning at all.
    
    After this CL:
    
    $ go test -bench=CompressedZipGarbage -count=5 -run=NONE archive/zip
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8              100          20881890 ns/op            5616 B/op         47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8               50          20622757 ns/op            5616 B/op         47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8               50          20628193 ns/op            5616 B/op         47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8              100          20756612 ns/op            5616 B/op         47 allocs/op
    BenchmarkCompressedZipGarbage-8              100          20639774 ns/op            5616 B/op         47 allocs/op
