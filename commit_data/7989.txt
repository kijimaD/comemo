commit 88a8ac08b903513ddec32caea7eb1b7ac0560da6
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Apr 5 12:51:10 2011 -0700

    gotest: fix a bug in error handling.
    If the command couldn't be found, argv[0] would be wiped.
    Also, fix a print statement not to refer to make - it was a vestige of a prior form.
