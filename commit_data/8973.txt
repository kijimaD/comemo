commit b39afde805f632bfbe5c4be7a68d01db03de2ce8
Author: Nigel Tao <nigeltao@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 8 09:54:21 2011 +1000

    image/draw: add draw tests where the destination image doesn't start
    at (0, 0).
    
    Also refactor the test to use the SubImage method rather than monkeying
    with an image's Pix and Rect fields.
