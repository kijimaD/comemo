    exp/ssh: refactor halfConnection to transport
            This CL generalises the pair of halfConnection members that the
            serverConn holds into a single transport struct that is shared by
            both Server and Client, see also CL 5037047.
    
            This CL is a replacement for 5040046 which I closed by accident.
