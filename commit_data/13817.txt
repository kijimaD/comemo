    crypto/tls: allow certificates and key to be in either order.
    
    X509KeyPair wasn't really supposed to allow the certificate and
    key to be in the same file, but it did work if you put the key
    first. Since some HTTPS servers support loading keys and certs
    like this, this change makes it work in either order.
    
    Fixes #3986.
