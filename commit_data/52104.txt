commit 5210a7128563e64952d432a0efd2d38c32cd090c

    run.bat: use cmd/dist instead of 'go install' to rebuild std and cmd
    
    cmd/dist may set and/or unset variables before building, and at any
    rate it is fragile to run 'go install' before sourcing env.bat.
    
    The build-stamp information embedded by the 'go' command is currently
    sensitive to whether CGO_* variables are implicit or explicit, so running
    'go install' before env.bat may cause stamped metadata to become stale.
    (Explicitly setting to the default arguably ought to produce the same
    metadata as leaving the variables unset, but that's a separate issue
    and a bigger cleanup.)
    
    Moreover, run.bat is supposed to parallel run.bash, and run.bash
    already hasn't invoked 'go install' itself since CL 6531!
    
    For #52009
