    doc/go1.11: explain new vet typechecking behaviour in release notes
    
    Since Go1.10, go test runs vet on the tests before executing them.
    
    Moreover, the vet tool typechecks the package under analysis with
    go/types before running. In Go1.10, a typechecking failure just caused
    a warning to be printed. In Go1.11, a typechecking failure will cause
    vet to exit with a fatal error (see Issue #21287).
    
    This means that starting with Go1.11, tests that don't typecheck will
    fail immediately. This would not normally be an issue, since a test
    that doesn't typecheck shouldn't even compile, and it should already
    be broken.
    
    Unfortunately, there's a bug in gc that makes it accept programs with
    unused variables inside a closure (Issue #3059). This means that a
    test with an unused variable inside a closure, that compiled and
    passed in Go1.10, will fail in the typechecking step of vet starting
    with Go1.11.
    
    Explain this in the 1.11 release notes.
    
    Fixes #26109
