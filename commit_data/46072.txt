    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: add SameSource, Uses, and DeclaredBy helpers
    
    Currently, because we use the same *Name to represent both declaration
    and uses of an object, it's ambiguous what "n1 == n2" means when
    comparing two Node values. It can mean any of: Are these the same
    syntactic element? Is n1 a use of declared variable n2? Are n1 and n2
    both uses of the same declared variable?
    
    We'd like to introduce a new IdentExpr node to replace use of Name
    within the AST, but that means those three cases need to be handled
    differently. The first case needs to stay "n1 == n2", but the other
    cases need to become "n1.Name() == n2" and "n1.Name() == n2.Name()",
    respectively. ("n1.Name() == n2.Name()" also currently works for the
    second case, but eventually we'll want to get rid of the Name.Name
    method.)
    
    This CL introduces helper functions SameSource and Uses to handle
    these cases. It also introduces DeclaredBy, which is another somewhat
    common case that the next CL introduces uses of.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
    
    Updates #42990.
