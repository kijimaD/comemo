    math: fix inaccurate result of Exp(1)
    
    The existing implementation is translated from C, which uses a
    polynomial coefficient very close to 1/6. If the function uses
    1/6 as this coeffient, the result of Exp(1) will be more accurate.
    And this change doesn't introduce more error to Exp function.
    
    Fixes #20319
