    time: speed up Since and Until
    
    time.now is somewhat expensive (much more expensive than nanotime),
    in the common case when Time has monotonic time we don't actually
    need to call time.now in Since/Until as we can do calculation
    based purely on monotonic times.
    
    name                  old time/op  new time/op  delta
    TCP4OneShotTimeout-6  17.0µs ± 0%  17.1µs ± 1%     ~     (p=0.151 n=5+5)
    SetReadDeadline-6      261ns ± 0%   234ns ± 1%  -10.35%  (p=0.008 n=5+5)
    
    Benchmark that only calls Until:
    
    benchmark            old ns/op     new ns/op     delta
    BenchmarkUntil       54.0          29.5          -45.37%
