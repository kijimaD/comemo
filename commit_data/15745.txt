    misc/emacs: Fix indentation for code following multiline function declarations
    
    Correctly indent the body of functions that have been declared
    over multiple lines. See http://play.golang.org/p/MHMwNDbFyf for
    an example.
    
    Previously, the body of the function would be indented as deep as
    the continuation line of the function declaration. Now it gets
    indented as deep as the func keyword.
