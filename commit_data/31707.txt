    runtime: expand acceptable PingPongHog factor from 2 to 5
    
    Since TestPingPongHog tests the scheduler, it's ultimately
    probabilistic. Currently, it requires the result be at most of factor
    of 2 off of the ideal. It turns out this isn't quite enough in
    practice, with factors on 1000 iterations on linux/amd64 ranging from
    0.48 to 2.5. If the test were failing, we would expect a factor closer
    to 1000X, so it's pretty safe to expand the accepted factor from 2 to
    5.
    
    Fixes #20494.
