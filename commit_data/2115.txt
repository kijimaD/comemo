commit 625866a9779d290d6617730091d45b9d3c0ae5c7
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>

    Conversion from array to slices should work like assignment:
    you should be able to convert a pointer to an array to a
    slice, you should not be able to convert an array to a slice.
    Currently 6g works the other way around.
