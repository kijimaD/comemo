    cmd/compile: preserve statement mark in rematerialized values
    
    Statement markers on rematerializable values were getting lost in
    register allocation.  This checks for that case (rematerializable
    input and using value share line number, but mark is on the input)
    and preserves the mark.
    
    When combined with other CLs in this series, this CL reduces the
    "nostmt" count (a line appears in the assembly, but no statement
    marker) for cmd/go from 413 to 277.  The rematerialized input is
    usually a LEAQ (on AMD64).
    
    The cause is "complicated"; for example, a NilCheck originally has the
    statement mark (a good thing, if the NilCheck  remains) but the
    NilCheck is removed and the mark floats to a Block end, then to a
    SliceMake.  The SliceMake decomposes and goes dead without preserving
    its marker (its component values are elided in other rewrites and may
    target inputs with different line numbers), but before deadcode
    removes it from the graph it moves the mark to an input, which at that
    time happens to be a LocalAddr. This eventually transforms to a LEAQ.
