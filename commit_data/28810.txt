    cmd/cgo: use alias for unsafe rather than separate functions
    
    When we need to generate a call to _cgoCheckPointer, we need to type
    assert the result back to the desired type. That is harder when the type
    is unsafe.Pointer, as the package can have values of unsafe.Pointer
    types without actually importing unsafe, by mixing C void* and :=. We
    used to handle this by generating a special function for each needed
    type, and defining that function in a separate file where we did import
    unsafe.
    
    Simplify the code by not generating those functions, but instead just
    import unsafe under the alias _cgo_unsafe. This is a simplification step
    toward a fix for issue #16591.
