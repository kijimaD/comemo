    cmd/nm: don't rely on an erroneous install target in tests
    
    Non-main packages in module mode should not be installed to
    GOPATH/pkg, but due to #37015 they were installed there anyway.
    This change switches the 'go install' command in testGoLib to instead
    use 'go build -buildmode=archive' with an explicit output file.
    
    For #37015.
