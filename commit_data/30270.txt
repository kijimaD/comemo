    runtime: disable stack rescanning by default
    
    With the hybrid barrier in place, we can now disable stack rescanning
    by default. This commit adds a "gcrescanstacks" GODEBUG variable that
    is off by default but can be set to re-enable STW stack rescanning.
    The plan is to leave this off but available in Go 1.8 for debugging
    and as a fallback.
    
    With this change, worst-case mark termination time at GOMAXPROCS=12
    *not* including time spent stopping the world (which is still
    unbounded) is reliably under 100 µs, with a 95%ile around 50 µs in
    every benchmark I tried (the go1 benchmarks, the x/benchmarks garbage
    benchmark, and the gcbench activegs and rpc benchmarks). Including
    time spent stopping the world usually adds about 20 µs to total STW
    time at GOMAXPROCS=12, but I've seen it add around 150 µs in these
    benchmarks when a goroutine takes time to reach a safe point (see
    issue #10958) or when stopping the world races with goroutine
    switches. At GOMAXPROCS=1, where this isn't an issue, worst case STW
    is typically 30 µs.
    
    The go-gcbench activegs benchmark is designed to stress large numbers
    of dirty stacks. This commit reduces 95%ile STW time for 500k dirty
    stacks by nearly three orders of magnitude, from 150ms to 195µs.
    
    This has little effect on the throughput of the go1 benchmarks or the
    x/benchmarks benchmarks.

    Comparing to the beginning of the hybrid barrier implementation
    ("runtime: parallelize STW mcache flushing") shows that the hybrid
    barrier trades a small performance impact for much better STW latency,
    as expected. The magnitude of the performance impact is generally
    small:

    Updates #17503.
    
    Updates #17099, since you can't have a rescan list bug if there's no
    rescan list. I'm not marking it as fixed, since gcrescanstacks can
    still be set to re-enable the rescan lists.
