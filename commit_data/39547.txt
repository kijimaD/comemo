    strings: clarify usage of Title and ToTitle
    
    This is intended to help clear up confusion around the usage of the
    Title and ToTitle functions. It includes a link to define title case
    to distinguish it from upper case. It also includes an additional
    example for the ToTitle function to showcase the difference in behavior
    between it and the Title function.
    
    Fixes #33302
