    sync: make WaitGroup more space-efficient
    
    The struct stores its 64-bit state field in a 12-byte array to
    ensure that it can be 64-bit-aligned. This leaves 4 spare bytes,
    which we can reuse to store the sema field.
    
    (32-bit alignment is still guaranteed because the array type was
    changed to [3]uint32.)
    
    Fixes #19149.
