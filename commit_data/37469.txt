    cmd/link/internal/wasm: add Go version as a custom wasm section
    
    The interface between the wasm binary and wasm_exec.js is experimental
    and likely to change in the future. Still, there are some early adopters
    who experiment with non-web wasm runtimes. They can't use wasm_exec.js
    and have to provide their own equivalent. Adding the Go version as a
    custom wasm sections allows for them to support a stable Go version and
    the latest devel at the same time.
