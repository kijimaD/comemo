    net/http: represent multi wildcards properly
    
    The routing tree used for matching ServeMux patterns used the
    key "*" to hold a child node for a multi-segment wildcard.
    The problem is that "*" is a valid path segment, which confused
    the matching algorithm: it would fetch the multi wildcard child
    when looking for the literal child for "*".
    
    Eschew clever encodings. Use a separate field in the node to
    represent the multi wildcard child.
    
    Fixes #67067.
