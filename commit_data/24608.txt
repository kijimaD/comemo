    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: fix function call memory accounting
    
    We were not recording function calls as
    changing the state of memory.
    
    As a result, the scheduler was not aware that
    storing values to the stack in order to make a
    function call must happen *after* retrieving
    results from the stack from a just-completed
    function call.
    
    This fixes the container/ring tests.
    
    This was my first experience debugging an issue
    using the HTML output. I'm feeling quite
    pleased with it.
