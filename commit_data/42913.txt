    net/http: mark http/2 connections active
    
    On Server.Shutdown, all idle connections are closed.
    A caveat for new connections is that they are marked idle
    after 5 seconds.
    Previously new HTTP/2 connections were marked New, and after 5 seconds,
    they would then become idle. With this change, we now mark HTTP/2
    connections as Active to allow the proper shutdown sequence to occur.
    
    Fixes #36946
    Fixes #39776
