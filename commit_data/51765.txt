    internal/fuzz: don't use dirty coverage maps during minimization
    
    When minimizing a value, if the value cannot be minimized (i.e. it is
    the final value is the same value as was sent for minimization) return
    the initial coverage map, rather than the coverageSnapshot, which is
    actually the coverage map for the final minimization step and may not
    accurately reflect whether the input actually expands the coverage set
    or not.
    
    Updates #48326
