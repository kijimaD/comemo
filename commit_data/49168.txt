    spec: use original terminology in metasyntax (cleanup)
    
    The metasyntax used in the spec is exactly the Wirth Syntax
    Notation (WSN), which eventually influenced EBNF. Add a link
    but keep mentioning EBNF which is likely more commonly known.
    
    Use the original terms in the productions. Specifically, use
    the words "Term" and "Factor" rather than "Alternative" and
    "Term".
    
    The terminology cleanup also resolves an inconsistency in the
    subsequent prose which is referring to the correct "terms" now.
    
    While at it, add a production for the entire Syntax itself,
    matching the original WSN definition.
    
    Also, replace the two uses of "grammar" with "syntax" for
    consistency ("syntax" is the prevalent term used throughout
    the spec).
    
    Fixes #50074.
