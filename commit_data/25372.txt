    net: make use of IPv4 for parsing routing information on windows
    
    In general the package net deals IPv4 addresses as IPv6 IPv4-mapped
    addresses internally for the dual stack era, when we need to support
    various techniques on IPv4/IPv6 translation.
    
    This change makes windows implementation follow the same pattern which
    BSD variants and Linux do.
    
    Updates #13544.
    
    Also fixes an unintentionally formatted line by accident by gofmt.
