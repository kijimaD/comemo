    crypto/tls: add CloseWrite method to Conn
    
    The CloseWrite method sends a close_notify alert record to the other
    side of the connection. This record indicates that the sender has
    finished sending on the connection. Unlike the Close method, the sender
    may still read from the connection until it recieves a close_notify
    record (or the underlying connection is closed). This is analogous to a
    TCP half-close.
