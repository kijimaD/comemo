    encoding/pem: make TestFuzz testing/quick safe
    
    This adapts pem.TestFuzz to sanitize the generated Block fields,
    because the encoder and wireformat do not differentiate between nil
    and empty slices and maps, while reflect.DeepEqual rightfully does.
    In the commit mentioned below, we adapt quick.Value in
    testing/quick to generate these value states, which had heretofore
    been impossible with the standard library fuzz test facility.
    
    This commit is a piecemeal extraction from ...
    
      https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/16470
    
    ..., which rsc requested to be separated from the nil slice and map
    generations.
