    os: in test, allow Hostname to return FQDN even if /bin/hostname does not
    
    Hostname reads the file /proc/sys/kernel/hostname to determine
    the value it returns. Some people set this to a Fully Qualified
    Doamin Name. At least one implementation of /bin/hostname
    truncates the name it gets (often from the "uname" system call)
    at the first dot unless it is given a "-f" flag. This change makes
    the unit test also truncate at the first dot and checks if the strings
    then match. This seems more portable than adding an extra flag
    to the called /bin/hostname program.
