commit d7a6d22852168c94986ec1a4ca81efdfd8752970
Author: Nigel Tao <nigeltao@golang.org>

    exp/draw fast path for glyph images.
    
    To draw.Draw a 32x32 image.Alpha 10000 times,
    Before: 633ms with 10000 mallocs
    After: 49ms with 0 mallocs
    
    These times are just blitting an image.Alpha, and do not include
    rasterizing a glyph's vector contours to an image.Alpha.
    
    The "generic" test case in draw_test.go tests this fast path.
