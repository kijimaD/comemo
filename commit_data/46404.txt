    cmd/compile/internal: better AST line highlight in ssa.html
    
    We tend to set div class with the line number in HTML AST nodes. So that
    the AST nodes can be highlighted with corresponding source and ssa ir.
    
    The pure AST text dump is created first. And then it is parsed and
    written to the HTML file.
    
    CL 275785 changed the format of the line information in AST node dump,
    which makes the HTMLWriter fail to parse the line information.
    
    This CL updates the code in HTMLWriter to align with the format of AST
    node dump.
    
    Fix #48133
