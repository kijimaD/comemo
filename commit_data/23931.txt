    cmd/internal/obj/arm: fix large stack offsets on nacl/arm
    
    The code already fixed large non-stack offsets
    but explicitly excluded stack references.
    Perhaps you could get away with that before,
    but current versions of nacl reject such stack
    references. Rewrite them the same as the others.
    
    For #11956 but probably not the last problem.
