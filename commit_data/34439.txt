    [release-branch.go1.9] cmd/go: clean up x.exe properly in TestImportMain
    
    More generally I'm concerned about these tests using
    $GOROOT/src/cmd/go as scratch space, especially
    combined wtih tg.parallel() - it's easy to believe some other
    test might inadvertently also try to write x.exe about the
    same time. This CL only solves the "didn't clean up x.exe"
    problem and leaves for another day the "probably shouldn't
    write to cmd/go at all" problem.
    
    Fixes #22266.
