    cmd/6l, cmd/8l: fix BSD builds
    
    Before this CL, running
    
            cd misc/cgo/test
            go test -c
            readelf --dyn-syms test.test | grep cgoexp
    
    turned up many UNDEF symbols corresponding to symbols actually
    in the binary but marked only cgo_export_static. Only symbols
    marked cgo_export_dynamic should be listed in this mode.
    And if the symbol is going to be listed, it should be listed with its
    actual address instead of UNDEF.
    
    The Linux dynamic linker didn't care about the seemingly missing
    symbols, but the BSD one did.
    
    This CL eliminates the symbols from the dyn-syms table.
