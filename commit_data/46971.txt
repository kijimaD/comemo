    runtime: do not treat morestack as a topofstack
    
    I added morestack to this list in 2013 with an explanation
    that they were needed if we “start a garbage collection on g0
    during a stack split or unsplit”.
    (https://golang.org/cl/11533043)
    
    This explanation no longer applies for a handful of reasons,
    most importantly that if we did stop a stack scan in the middle
    of a call to morestack, we'd ignore pointers above the split,
    which would lead to memory corruption. But we don't scan
    goroutine stacks during morestack now, so that can't happen.
    If we did see morestack during a GC, that would be a good time
    to crash the program.
    
    The real problem with morestack is during profiling, as noted
    in the code review conversation during 2013. And in profiling
    we just need to know to stop and not unwind further, which
    the new SPWRITE bit will do for us.
    
    So remove from topofstack and let the program crash if GC
    sees morestack and otherwise let the SPWRITE stop morestack
    unwinding during profiling.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
