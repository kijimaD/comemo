    [dev.unified] test: relax issue7921.go diagnostic message
    
    For constants literal, iimport/iexport read/write them as basic literal
    nodes. So they are printed in diagnostic message as Go syntax. So "foo"
    will be reported as string("foo").
    
    Unified IR read/write the raw expression as string value, and when
    printed in diagnostic, the string value is written out exactly as-is, so
    "foo" will be written as "foo".
    
    Thus, this CL relax the test in issue7921.go to match the string value only.
