    runtime: fix check for vacuous page boundary rounding again
    
    The previous fix for this, commit 336dad2a, had everything right in
    the commit message, but reversed the test in the code. Fix the test in
    the code.
    
    This reversal effectively disabled the scavenger on large page systems
    *except* in the rare cases where this code was originally wrong, which
    is why it didn't obviously show up in testing.
    
    Fixes #16644. Again. :(
