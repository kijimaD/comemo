    runtime: allow TestCtrlHandler to run in ConPTY
    
    Fixes #51602. Previous test would not run in a pseudo-console (ConPTY).
    
    New test avoids taskkill entirely by having the child request its own
    console window be closed.
    
    Verified that this runs locally (within a real console), over SSH
    (within a pseudo-console), and that it breaks if #41884 were reverted.
