    syscall: rewrite handle inheritance test to use C rather than Powershell
    
    In CL 327210, we disabled this test on arm platforms, because the
    powershell shipped with those systems isn't native, which means it'd
    refuse to load native DLLs. This commit rewrites the test to simply not
    use Powershell, and instead compiles a trivial C program that tests for
    the same thing. Reverting CL 316269 makes this test fail, as desired,
    while applying it makes this test succeed.
    
    Fixes #46701
