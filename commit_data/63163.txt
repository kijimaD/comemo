    crypto/tls: match compression method alert across versions
    
    When a pre-TLS 1.3 server processes a client hello message that
    indicates compression methods that don't include the null compression
    method, send an illegal parameter alert.
    
    Previously we did this for TLS 1.3 server handshakes only, and the
    legacy TLS versions used alertHandshakeFailure for this circumstance. By
    switching this to alertIllegalParameter we use a consistent alert across
    all TLS versions, and can also enable the NoNullCompression-TLS12 BoGo
    test we were skipping.
