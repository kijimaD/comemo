    cmd/compile: eliminate NoFramePointer
    
    The NoFramePointer function flag is no longer used, so this CL
    eliminates it. This cleans up some confusion between the compiler's
    NoFramePointer flag and obj's NOFRAME flag. NoFramePointer was
    intended to eliminate the saved base pointer on x86, but it was
    translated into obj's NOFRAME flag. On x86, NOFRAME does mean to omit
    the saved base pointer, but on ppc64 and s390x it has a more general
    meaning of omitting *everything* from the frame, including the saved
    LR and ppc64's "fixed frame". Hence, on ppc64 and s390x there are far
    fewer situations where it is safe to set this flag.
