    runtime: handle sysReserve failure in mHeap_SysAlloc
    
    sysReserve will return nil on failure - correctly handle this case and return
    nil to the caller. Currently, a failure will result in h.arena_end being set
    to psize, h.arena_used being set to zero and fun times ensue.
    
    On the openbsd/arm builder this has resulted in:
    
      runtime: address space conflict: map(0x0) = 0x40946000
      fatal error: runtime: address space conflict
    
    When it should be reporting out of memory instead.
