    net/http: adaptive wait time in PersistConnLeak tests
    
    In tests TransportPersistConnLeak and TransportPersistConnLeakShortBody,
    there's a fixed wait time (100ms and 400ms respectively) to allow
    goroutines to exit after CloseIdleConnections is called. This
    is sometimes too short on a slow host running many simultaneous
    tests.
    
    This CL replaces the fixed sleep in each test with a sequence of
    shorter sleeps, testing the number of remaining goroutines until
    it reaches the threshold or an overall time limit of 500ms expires.
    This prevents some failures in the plan9_arm builder, while reducing
    the test time on faster machines.
    
    Fixes #14887
