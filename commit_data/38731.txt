    net: retrieve if unix network is available only once for AIX
    
    The previous version was executing "oslevel -s" everytime testableNetwork
    was called with unix/unixgram network. The current version retrieves if
    the network is possible only once at the beginning of the tests.
    
    This is clearly faster:
    ok      net     74.045s
    ok      net     5.098s
