    gc: disallow absolute import paths
    
    They are broken and hard to make work.
    
    They have never worked: if you import "/tmp/x"
    from "/home/rsc/p.c" then the compiler rewrites
    this into import "/home/rsc/tmp/x", which is
    clearly wrong.
    
    Also we just disallowed the : character in import
    paths, so import "c:/foo" is already not allowed.
    
    Finally, in order to support absolute paths well in
    a build tool we'd have to provide a mechanism to
    instruct the compiler to resolve absolute imports
    by looking in some other tree (where the binaries live)
    and provide a mapping from absolute path to location
    in that tree.  This CL avoids adding that complexity.
    
    This is not part of the language spec (and should not be),
    so no spec change is needed.
    
    If we need to make them work later, we can.
