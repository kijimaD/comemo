    iter: fix race instrumentation for Pull2
    
    Pull2 tests are failing with -race, giving false-positive race conditions
    due to bad race instrumentation.
    
    No tests for this as it should be caught by the race builders. The only
    reason it was not caught is because it is behind GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc.
    
    Fixes #64651
