    internal/cpu: make architectures without initialization work explicit
    
    When cpu_no_init.go was created most architectures did not have
    code in the doinit function. Currently only mips(le), riscv64 and
    wasm do not have empty doinit functions.
    
    Keeping cpu_no_init.go around does not reduce the work to satisfy
    the build process when adding support for new architectures.
    
    To support a new architecture a new file or build directive has to
    be added to an existing file at any rate to define the constant
    CacheLinePadSize. A new empty doinit can then be created in the
    new file or the existing doinit can be reused when adding the
    additional build directive.
