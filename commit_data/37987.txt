    go/types: include test/fixedbugs/bug073.go again in test
    
    This test was excluded from the go/types std lib test
    because it tested old behavior (shift count must be
    an unsigned int). With the compiler changes made and
    the test adjusted accordingly, we can include it again.
    
    Updates #19113.
