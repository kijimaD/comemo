    cmd/dist, build: support building statically linked toolchain
    
    Added a new $GO_DISTFLAGS to make.bash, and while we're here,
    added mention $CXX in make.bash (CL 13704044).
    
    Fixes #6448.
    Update #3564
    We can pass GO_DISTFLAGS=-s from misc/dist to make.bash so that
    it will build a statically linked toolchain.
    (Note: OS X doesn't have the concept of static linking, so don't
    pass GO_DISTFLAGS=-s for OS X builds)
