    cmd/go/internal/lockedfile, os: fix O_CREATE flag on Plan 9
    
    os.OpenFile was assuming that a failed syscall.Open means the file does
    not exist and it tries to create it. However, syscall.Open may have
    failed for some other reason, such as failing to lock a os.ModeExclusive
    file. We change os.OpenFile to only create the file if the error
    indicates that the file doesn't exist.
    
    Remove skip of TestTransform test, which was failing because sometimes
    syscall.Open would fail due to the file being locked, but the
    syscall.Create would succeed because the file is no longer locked. The
    create was truncating the file.
    
    Fixes #35471
