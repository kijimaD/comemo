    cmd/internal/gc: add -buildid flag to write build ID into object file
    
    The build ID is an opaque token supplied by the build system.
    The compiler writes it out early in the Go export metadata
    (the second line), in a way that does not bother existing readers.
    
    The intent is that the go command can use this to store information
    about the sources for the generated code, so that it can detect
    stale packages even in cases (like removed files) where mtimes fail.
