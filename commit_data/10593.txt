    doc: do not slice array literal
    
    The special case in the spec is that you can take the
    address of a composite literal using the & operator.
    
    A composite literal is not, however, generally addressable,
    and the slice operator requires an addressable argument,
    so [3]int{1,2,3}[:] is invalid.  This tutorial code and one bug
    report are the only places in the tree where it appears.
