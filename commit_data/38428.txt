    cmd/asm: add s390x VMSLG instruction variants
    
    VMSLG has three variants on z14 and later machines. These variants are used in "limbified" squaring:
    VMSLEG: Even Shift Indication -- the even-indexed intermediate result is doubled
    VMSLOG: Odd Shift Indication -- the odd-indexed intermediate result is doubled
    VMSLEOG: Even and Odd Shift Indication -- both intermediate results are doubled
    Limbified squaring is very useful for high performance cryptographic algorithms, such as
    elliptic curve. This change allows these instructions to be used in Go assembly.
