    cmd/compile: convert merge to use appl. bal. trees for sharing
    
    This CL replaces a not-very-shared linear-sized set
    representation with a much more shared representation.
    For the annoying test program in question, it reduces
    the heap size by 95%, and the time slightly.
    
    However, for some programs build time is longer.
    
    This also includes at least one bug fix for problems
    uncovered while ensuring compatibility with what it
    replaces.
    
    Fixes #51543.
