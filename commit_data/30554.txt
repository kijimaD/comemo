    runtime: fix Windows profiling crash
    
    I don't have any way to test or reproduce this problem,
    but the current code is clearly wrong for Windows.
    Make it better.
    
    As I said on #17165:
    
    But the borrowing of M's and the profiling of M's by the CPU profiler
    seem not synchronized enough. This code implements the CPU profiler
    on Windows:
    
            func profileloop1(param uintptr) uint32 {
                    stdcall2(_SetThreadPriority, currentThread, _THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST)
    
                    for {
                            stdcall2(_WaitForSingleObject, profiletimer, _INFINITE)
                            first := (*m)(atomic.Loadp(unsafe.Pointer(&allm)))
                            for mp := first; mp != nil; mp = mp.alllink {
                                    thread := atomic.Loaduintptr(&mp.thread)
                                    // Do not profile threads blocked on Notes,
                                    // this includes idle worker threads,
                                    // idle timer thread, idle heap scavenger, etc.
                                    if thread == 0 || mp.profilehz == 0 || mp.blocked {
                                            continue
                                    }
                                    stdcall1(_SuspendThread, thread)
                                    if mp.profilehz != 0 && !mp.blocked {
                                            profilem(mp)
                                    }
                                    stdcall1(_ResumeThread, thread)
                            }
                    }
            }
    
            func profilem(mp *m) {
                    var r *context
                    rbuf := make([]byte, unsafe.Sizeof(*r)+15)
    
                    tls := &mp.tls[0]
                    gp := *((**g)(unsafe.Pointer(tls)))
    
                    // align Context to 16 bytes
                    r = (*context)(unsafe.Pointer((uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&rbuf[15]))) &^ 15))
                    r.contextflags = _CONTEXT_CONTROL
                    stdcall2(_GetThreadContext, mp.thread, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(r)))
                    sigprof(r.ip(), r.sp(), 0, gp, mp)
            }
    
            func sigprof(pc, sp, lr uintptr, gp *g, mp *m) {
                    if prof.hz == 0 {
                            return
                    }
    
                    // Profiling runs concurrently with GC, so it must not allocate.
                    mp.mallocing++
    
                    ... lots of code ...
    
                    mp.mallocing--
            }
    
    A borrowed M may migrate between threads. Between the
    atomic.Loaduintptr(&mp.thread) and the SuspendThread, mp may have
    moved to a new thread, so that it's in active use. In particular
    it might be calling malloc, as in the crash stack trace. If so, the
    mp.mallocing++ in sigprof would provoke the crash.
    
    Those lines are trying to guard against allocation during sigprof.
    But on Windows, mp is the thread being traced, not the current
    thread. Those lines should really be using getg().m.mallocing, which
    is the same on Unix but not on Windows. With that change, it's
    possible the race on the actual thread is not a problem: the traceback
    would get confused and eventually return an error, but that's fine.
    The code expects that possibility.
    
    Fixes #17165.
