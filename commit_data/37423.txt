    doc/go_spec: tweak wording to avoid 'explicit assignment' misreading
    
    This text changed in CL 139099 to add "explicit" in front of "conversion".
    But now "explicit conversion or assignment" reads like it might mean
    "explicit [conversion or assignment]" when what is meant is
    "[explicit conversion] or assignment". To make clear that explicit does
    not apply to assignment, use "assignment or explicit conversion".
