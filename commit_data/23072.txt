    runtime: include heap goal in gctrace line
    
    This may or may not be useful to the end user, but it's incredibly
    useful for us to understand the behavior of the pacer. Currently this
    is fairly easy (though not trivial) to derive from the other heap
    stats we print, but we're about to change how we compute the goal,
    which will make it much harder to derive.
