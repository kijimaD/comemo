    runtime: don't clear gcscanvalid in casfrom_Gscanstatus
    
    Currently we clear gcscanvalid in both casgstatus and
    casfrom_Gscanstatus if the new status is _Grunning. This is very
    important to do in casgstatus. However, this is potentially wrong in
    casfrom_Gscanstatus because in this case the caller doesn't own gp and
    hence the write is racy. Unlike the other _Gscan statuses, during
    _Gscanrunning, the G is still running. This does not indicate that
    it's transitioning into a running state. The scan simply hasn't
    happened yet, so it's neither valid nor invalid.
    
    Conveniently, this also means clearing gcscanvalid is unnecessary in
    this case because the G was already in _Grunning, so we can simply
    remove this code. What will happen instead is that the G will be
    preempted to scan itself, that scan will set gcscanvalid to true, and
    then the G will return to _Grunning via casgstatus, clearing
    gcscanvalid.
    
    This fix will become necessary shortly when we start keeping track of
    the set of G's with dirty stacks, since it will no longer be
    idempotent to simply set gcscanvalid to false.
