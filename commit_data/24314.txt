    cmd/go: for get -t and list, look up path in vendor directories
    
    This is needed to handle vendor directories correctly.  It was already
    done for the regular imports when the package was loaded, but not for
    the test-only imports.
    
    It would be nice to do this while loading the package, but that breaks
    the code that checks for direct references to vendor packages when
    running go test.  This change is relatively contained.
    
    While we're at it, skip "C" test imports in go get.
    
    Fixes #11628.
    Fixes #11717.
