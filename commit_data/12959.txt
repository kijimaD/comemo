commit bcf48c797176aaecccd3001484ffefc9c31a23a8

    exp/locale/collate: added trie for associating colElems to runes.
    The trie code looks a lot like the trie in exp/norm. It uses different
    types, however.  Also, there is only a lookup for []byte and the unsafe
    lookup methods have been dropped, as well as sparse mode.
    There is now a method for generating a trie. To output Go code, one now needs
    to first generate a trie and then call print() on it.
