    net/http: don't sniff Content-type in Server when X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff
    
    The docs for ResponseWriter.Write say
    // If the Header
    // does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
    // to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
    // DetectContentType.
    
    The header X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff is an explicit directive that
    content-type should not be sniffed.
    
    This changes the behavior of Response.WriteHeader so that, when
    there is an X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff header, but there is
    no Content-type header, the following happens:
    1.  A Content-type:application/octet-stream is added
    2.  A warning is logged via the server's logging mechanism.
    
    Previously, a content-type would have been silently added based on
    heuristic analysis of the first 512B which might allow a hosted
    GIF like http://www.thinkfu.com/blog/gifjavascript-polyglots to be
    categorized as JavaScript which might allow a CSP bypass, loading
    as a script despite `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' `.
