    net/http: use testenv.Command instead of exec.Command in tests
    
    On Unix platforms, testenv.Command sends SIGQUIT to stuck commands
    before the test times out. For subprocesses that are written in Go,
    that causes the runtime to dump running goroutines, and in other
    languages it triggers similar behavior (such as a core dump).
    If the subprocess is stuck due to a bug (such as #57999), that may
    help to diagnose it.
    
    For #57999.
