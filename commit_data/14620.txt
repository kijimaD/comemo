    go/build: give better explanation for "cannot find package"
    
    Fixes #4079.
    
    Some example output:
    
    % go install foo/bar
    can't load package: package foo/bar: cannot find package "foo/bar" in any of:
            /home/dfc/go/src/pkg/foo/bar (from $GOROOT)
            /home/dfc/src/foo/bar (from $GOPATH)
            /home/dfc/src2/src/foo/bar
    
    % GOPATH= go install foo/bar
    can't load package: package foo/bar: cannot find package "foo/bar" in any of:
            /home/dfc/go/src/pkg/foo/bar (from $GOROOT)
            ($GOPATH not set)
