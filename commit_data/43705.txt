    [dev.link] cmd/link: refactor section creation in dodata
    
    Additional cleanups and refactorings in the allocateSections portion
    of dodata. Introduce some new helper routines to be used for common
    cases in creating sections and assigning symbols, with a goal of
    reducing duplicated code blocks and having more readable code.
    
    No change in functionality.
