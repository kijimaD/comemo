    runtime: write trace stack tab directly to trace buffer
    
    Currently, the stack frame of (*traceStackTable).dump is 68KiB. We're
    about to move (*traceStackTable).dump to the system stack, where we
    often don't have this much room.
    
    5140 bytes of this is an on-stack temporary buffer for constructing
    potentially large trace events before copying these out to the actual
    trace buffer.
    
    Reduce the stack frame size by writing these events directly to the
    trace buffer rather than temporary space. This introduces a couple
    complications:
    
    - The trace event starts with a varint encoding the event payload's
      length in bytes. These events are large and somewhat complicated, so
      it's hard to know the size ahead of time. That's not a problem with
      the temporary buffer because we can just construct the event and see
      how long it is. In order to support writing directly to the trace
      buffer, we reserve enough bytes for a maximum size varint and add
      support for populating a reserved space after the fact.
    
    - Emitting a stack event calls traceFrameForPC, which can itself emit
      string events. If these were emitted in the middle of the stack
      event, it would corrupt the stream. We already allocate a []Frame to
      convert the PC slice to frames, and then convert each Frame into a
      traceFrame with trace string IDs, so we address this by combining
      these two steps into one so that all trace string events are emitted
      before we start constructing the stack event.
    
    For #53979.
