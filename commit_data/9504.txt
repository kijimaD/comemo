    json: fix decode bug with struct tag names with ,opts being ignored
    
    When the encoder was updated to respect the ",omitempty"
    struct tag options, the decoder half was never updated to know
    about the new struct tag format. (the format is now an optional
    name, followed by zero or more ",option" strings)
    
    This only affected people who used ",omitempty" along with
    a field name. In that case, the serialized JSON wouldn't
    decode to the original value.
