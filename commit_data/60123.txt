    runtime/pprof: ignore runtime-internal samples in test
    
    Tests of the mutex profile focus on sync.Mutex, which is easy to
    control. But since those tests still use the runtime, and contention on
    internal runtime.mutex values is now also part of the mutex profile, we
    have to filter out those samples before examining the profile. Otherwise
    the test may be confused by stray contention on sched.lock (or other
    runtime-internal locks) as a natural consequence of using goroutines.
    
    Fixes #67563
