    [dev.ssa] test: use SSA codegen for runnable tests
    
    Now that the standard library tests
    are all passing, add the
    test directory tests.
    
    These contain a number of edge case tests
    that are of particular interest for compilers.
    
    Some kinds of tests are not well-suited
    for a new backend, such as errorcheck tests.
    To start, use SSA only for run and runoutput.
    
    There are three failing tests now.
    Just mark them as such for now,
    so that we can prevent regressions.
    
    This code will all be unwound once SSA
    codegen matures and becomes the default.
