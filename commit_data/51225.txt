    cmd/compile: only avoid escaping package paths for "go.shape"
    
    We have code that intends to avoid escaping the package path for
    built-in packages. But it is hard to determine which packages are
    built-in from a general rule, and we really only want to avoid escaping
    for the "go.shape" package (since that gives ugly shape type names). So,
    fix the code to only avoid escaping the package path specifically for
    the "go.shape" package.
    
    Fixes #50200
