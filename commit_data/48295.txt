    cmd/compile: fix reentrancy issue in unified IR function body reading
    
    We shouldn't need to read in function bodies for new functions found
    during inlining, but something is expecting them to still be read
    in. We should fix that code to not depend on them being read in, but
    in the mean time reading them in anyway is at least correct, albeit
    less efficient in time and space.
    
    Fixes #49536.
    Updates #50552.
