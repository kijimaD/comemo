    cmd/asm: add MRC and MCR to end-to-end test for arm
    
    The old, per-architecture operand printers didn't lock down the
    format of the constant in the MRC and MCR instructions (a value
    that could be presented more helpfully - maybe how the
    input looks? - but that is an issue for another day). But there is
    a portable standard printer now so we can enable tests for these
    instructions.
