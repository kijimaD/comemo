    runtime: use threads slice in parfor instead of unsafe pointer math
    
    parfor originally used a tail array for its thread array.  This got
    replaced with a slice allocation in the conversion to Go, but many of
    its gnarlier effects remained.  Instead of keeping track of the
    pointer to the first element of the slice and using unsafe pointer
    math to get at the ith element, just keep the slice around and use
    regular slice indexing.  There is no longer any need for padding to
    64-bit align the tail array (there hasn't been since the Go
    conversion), so remove this unnecessary padding from the parfor
    struct.  Finally, since the slice tracks its own length, replace the
    nthrmax field with len(thr).
