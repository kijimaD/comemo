commit 6af887ec0303ade5ef5fde72fba5c28f72907685
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Mon May 2 09:16:31 2011 -0700

    go spec: restricted expressions may still be parenthesized
    
    No language change.
    
    - added a few examples with parentheses
    - added a corresponding sentence to assignments
      (this explicitly permits: (_) = 0, currently allowed by 6g,
      gofmt, but marked as an error by gccgo).
