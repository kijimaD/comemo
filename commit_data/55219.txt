    cmd/dist: mark linux/sparc64 as a broken port, remove incomplete map
    
    The linux/sparc64 port is incompleteâ€”it doesn't work, and it doesn't
    have a builder. Now that dist supports broken ports, mark it as such.
    
    The incomplete map was created to hide ports that aren't functional
    from dist list output. Now that we have the broken port concept, it
    seems largely redundant, so remove it for now.
    
    For #56679.
    Updates #28944.
