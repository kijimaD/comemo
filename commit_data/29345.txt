    crypto/tls: Add mutex to protect KeyLogWriter
    
    Concurrent use of tls.Config is allowed, and may lead to
    KeyLogWriter being written to concurrently. Without a mutex
    to protect it, corrupted output may occur. A mutex is added
    for correctness.
    
    The mutex is made global to save size of the config struct as
    KeyLogWriter is rarely enabled.
    
    Related to #13057.
