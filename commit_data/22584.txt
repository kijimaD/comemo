    os/exec: post-process lsof output on Android.
    
    lsof is used to inspect the open file desciptors in exec_test.go.
    In order to limit the output of lsof to the tested process, the tests use
    lsof with the -p option, but the version of lsof in android seems to ignore
    it. This change adds a post-processing step to filter out irrelevant entries.
    
    Fixes golang/go#10206.
