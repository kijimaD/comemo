    cmd/asm: add the fifth argument of the instruction to Optab on arm64
    
    Currently the Optab structure contains four arguments of an instruction,
    excludes the fifth argument p.RegTo2. It does not participate in
    instruction matching and is usually handled separately.
    
    Instructions with five operands are common in the newer arm instruction
    set, so this CL adds the fifth argument to Optab, so that instruction
    matching is easier. This caused the oplook function also needs to be
    updated synchronously, this CL also made some cleaning and modifications
    to this function.
