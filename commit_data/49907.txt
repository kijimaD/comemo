    net/http: make Request.WithContext documentation less prescriptive
    
    WithContext makes a shallow copy of a Request, and Clone makes a
    deep copy. Both set the context of the new request. The distinction
    between the two is clear, and it doesn't seem useful or necessary
    to say that "it's rare to need WithContext".
    
    Also update a couple locations that mention WithContext to mention
    Clone as well.
    
    Fixes #53413.
