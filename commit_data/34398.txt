    build: move final steps of make.bash, make.bat, make.rc into cmd/dist
    
    This CL expands the job of "dist bootstrap" to be "finish make.bash".
    I need to change that logic in upcoming CLs related to cmd/go
    changes, and I'd rather not change it in three places in three different
    shell script languages.
