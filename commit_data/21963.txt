    debug/elf: regularize DWARF section loading
    
    Previously, different DWARF sections had relocations applied in very
    different ways.  .debug_info was relocated, but only on x86-64 and 386
    and using hard-coded relocation section names instead of relocation
    links.  .debug_abbrev and .debug_str were never relocated (which is
    excusable because they shouldn't need it).  .debug_types sections were
    relocated on all architectures and found their relocation section
    using a relocation link because section names could be ambiguous.
    
    Simplify all of this so that every DWARF section that has a linked
    relocation section gets those relocations applied.
    
    This prepares this code to load .debug_line sections without the need
    for yet more ad hoc relocation logic.
