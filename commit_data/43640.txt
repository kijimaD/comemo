    runtime: explictly state lock ordering direction
    
    At least as far as I can tell, this file never explicitly states whether
    locks with higher or lower rank should be taken first. It is implied in
    some comments, and clear from the code, of course.
    
    Add an explicit comment to make things more clear and hopefully reduce
    new locks being adding in the wrong spot.
