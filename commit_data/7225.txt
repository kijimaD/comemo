    codereview: handle file patterns better
    
    If a file pattern is given and matches files that look
    like they need to be hg added or hg removed, offer to do so.
    
    If a file pattern is given and matches files in another CL, warn.
    
    If a file pattern doesn't match anything, point that out.
    
    Vet first line of CL description.
    
    Fixes #972.
