    runtime: clean up runtime.call* frame sizes on ARM64
    
    ARM64 used to require that all assembly frame sizes were of the form
    16*N+8 because ARM64 requires 16-byte SP alignment and the assembler
    added an 8 byte LR slot. This made all of the runtime.call* frame
    sizes wonky. The assembler now rounds up the frame size appropriately
    after adding any additional slots it needs, so this is no longer
    necessary.
    
    This CL cleans up the frame sizes of these functions so they look the
    way you'd expect and match all other architectures.
