    test: re-enable rotate tests
    
    Memory usage has been reduced.
    The tests are still slow,
    but that is issue #10571.
    
    /usr/bin/time shows significant variation
    in the peak memory usage compiling with tip.
    This is unsurprising, given GC.
    
    Using Go 1.4.2, memory is stable at 410mb.
    Using tip at d2ee09298,
    memory ranges from 470mb (+15%) to 534mb (+30%),
    with a mean of 504mb (+23%), with n=50.
    
    Fixes #9933.
