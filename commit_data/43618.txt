    Revert "cmd/compile,cmd/internal/sys: enable additional build modes on linux/riscv64"
    
    This reverts CL 263457.
    
    It turns out that this still missed changes to cmd/link/internal/ld/config.go
    and some of these build modes also fail once cgo is enabled. Disable again for
    now.
