    net/http: fix another data race when sharing Request.Body
    
    Fix another issue (similar to Issue 6995) where there was a
    data race when sharing a server handler's Request.Body with
    another goroutine that out-lived the Handler's goroutine.
    
    In some cases we were not closing the incoming Request.Body
    (which would've required reading it until the end) if we
    thought it we thought we were going to be forcibly closing the
    underlying net.Conn later anyway. But that optimization
    largely moved to the transfer.go *body later, and locking was
    added to *body which then detected read-after-close, so now
    calling the (*body).Close always is both cheap and correct.
    
    No new test because TestTransportAndServerSharedBodyRace caught it,
    albeit only sometimes. Running:
    
    while ./http.test -test.cpu=8 -test.run=TestTransportAndServerSharedBodyRace; do true; done
    
    ... would reliably cause a race before, but not now.
    
    Update #6995
    Fixes #7092
