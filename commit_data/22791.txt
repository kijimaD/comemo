    cmd/internal/ld: add -buildmode=c-shared as an alternative to -shared
    
    The linker currently (on some platforms) takes a -shared flag, which means
    approximately what -buildmode=c-shared means in the in the proposed "Go
    Execution Modes" document. As part of implementing other modes, the term
    "shared" becomes horribly overloaded, so this replaces -shared with a
    -buildmode argument instead (which currently only handles -buildmode=c-shared
    and the default -buildmode=exe -- no new behaviour here).
    
    As the linker support for -shared was in 1.4 this retains it as an alias.
