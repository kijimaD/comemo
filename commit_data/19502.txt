    cmd/6g: fix stack zeroing on native client
    
    I am not sure what the rounding here was
    trying to do, but it was skipping the first
    pointer on native client.
    
    The code above the rounding already checks
    that xoffset is widthptr-aligned, so the rnd
    was a no-op everywhere but on Native Client.
    And on Native Client it was wrong.
    
    Perhaps it was supposed to be rounding down,
    not up, but zerorange handles the extra 32 bits
    correctly, so the rnd does not seem to be necessary
    at all.
    
    This wouldn't be worth doing for Go 1.3 except
    that it can affect code on the playground.
    
    Fixes #8155.
