    cmd/go: hide work subdirectory names in gcc/clang object files
    
    Until now the subdirectories under $WORK have had predictable
    names, so it was OK to strip just $WORK from the file names that
    end up in object files. In the future, those predictable names would
    cause predictable collisions when compiling one package in two
    different ways, so we're moving toward arbitrary, unpredictable
    subdirectory names instead. When we do that, if the names appear
    in the object files we won't get reproducible builds.
    
    Take the subdirectory names out now, to make the later change safe.
