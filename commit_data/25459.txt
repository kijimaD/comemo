    net: check /etc/hosts for modifications every 5 seconds, not 5 minutes
    
    But also cache the previous parsed form and don't reread if the
    size and modification time are both unchanged from before.
    
    On systems with stable /etc/hosts this should result in more stat calls
    but only a single parsing of /etc/hosts.
    
    On systems with variable /etc/hosts files (like some Docker systems)
    this should result in quicker adoption of changes.
    
    Fixes #13340.
