    cmd/link: recognize arm header of PE objects
    
    The linker recognizes headers for 386 and amd64 PE objects, but not arm
    objects. This is easily overlooked, since its the same as the 386 header
    value, except the two nibbles of the first word are swapped. This commit
    simply adds the check for this. Without it, .syso objects are rejected,
    which means Windows binaries can't have resources built into them. At
    the same time, we add comments to better indicate which condition
    applies to which arch.
