    net: fix res_search uses on alpine, android, dragonfly
    
    On Android and Dragonfly, don't use -lresolv. It doesn't exist there.
    
    On Linux, use res_search instead of res_nsearch.
    glibc makes res_search thread-safe by having a per-thread __res.
    It still also provides res_nsearch.
    musl makes res_search thread-safe by ignoring __res completely.
    It does not provide res_nsearch at all.
    Changing to res_search on Linux will fix builds on musl-based systems
    while keeping glibc-based systems working.
    
    Fixes #56657.
    Fixes #56660.
