    [dev.fuzz] internal/fuzz: add minimization of []byte
    
    This works by minimizing for a maximum of one minute. We may consider
    making this customizable in the future.
    
    This only minimizes []byte inputs which caused a recoverable error. In
    the future, it should support minimizing other appopriate types, and
    minimizing types which caused non-recoverable errors (though this is
    much more expensive).
    
    The code in internal/fuzz/worker.go is copied from, or heavily inspired
    by, code originally authored by Dmitry Vyukov and Josh Bleecher Snyder
    as part of the go-fuzz project. Thanks to them for their contributions.
