    runtime: fix misaligned SP for libfuzzer entry
    
    libfuzzer is written in C and so requires by the C abi that SP be
    aligned correctly mod 16. Normally CALLs need to have SP aligned to 0
    mod 16, but because we're simulating a CALL (which pushes a return
    address) with a JMP (which doesn't), we need to align to 8 mod 16
    before JMPing.
    
    This is not causing any current problems that I know of. All the
    functions called from this callsite that I checked don't rely on
    correct alignment.  So this CL is just futureproofing.
    
    Update #49075
