    cmd/cgo: support large unsigned macro again
    
    The approach of https://golang.org/cl/43476 turned out incorrect.
    The problem is that the sniff introduced by the CL only work for simple
    expression. And when it fails it fallback to uint64, not int64, which
    breaks backward compatibility.
    In this CL, we use DWARF for guessing kind instead. That should be more
    reliable than previous approach. And importanly, it fallbacks to int64 even
    if it fails to guess kind.
    
    Fixes #21708
