    net/http: add Server.ServeTLS method
    
    Server.ServeTLS wraps Server.Serve with added TLS support. This is
    particularly useful for serving on manually initialized listeners.
    Example use-case includes ability to serve with TLS on listener
    provided by systemd's socket activation.
    
    A matching test heavily based on TestAutomaticHTTP2_ListenAndServe
    is also included.
