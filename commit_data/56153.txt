    cmd/compile: fix reproducible build of aliased generic types
    
    Due to a missing "&& !alias" check, the unified linker was treating
    type aliases the same as defined types for the purpose of exporting
    method bodies. The methods will get exported anyway alongside the
    aliased type, so this mistake is normally harmless.
    
    However, if multiple type aliases instantiated the same generic type
    but with different type arguments, this could result in the
    same (generic) method body being exported multiple times under
    different symbol names. Further, because bodies aren't expected to be
    exported multiple times, we were sorting them simply based on index.
    And consequently, the sort wasn't total and is sensitive to the map
    iteration order used while ranging over linker.bodies.
    
    The fix is simply to add the missing "&& !alias" check, so that we
    don't end up with duplicate bodies in the first place.
    
    Thanks rsc@ for providing a minimal repro case.
    
    Fixes #59571.
