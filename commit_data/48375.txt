    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile:  keep instantiated method as a method, rather than converting to function
    
    Previously, we were converting an instantitated method to a function, by
    moving the receiver arg to the regular args, etc. But that made the type
    of the method signature inconsistent with the signature on the method
    fields, which leads to some problems with more complex programs with
    instantiations. And things work fine if we leave the instantiated method
    as a method. So, make the change to keep instantiated methods as real
    methods (until they are transformed much later in the compiler).
