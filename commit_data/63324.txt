    cmd/dist: test encoding/json/... with GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2
    
    This also updates wasip1_wasm to use a 8MiB stack, which is
    the same stack size as what is used by go_js_wasm_exec.
    The increase of stack size is necessary because the jsonv2
    tests exercise that the jsonv2 and jsontext packages support
    a hard limit of a maximum JSON nesting depth of 10000.
    However, even with a depth limit of 10000, this still exceeds
    the previously specified maximum stack size of 1 MiB.
    
    For use of JSON with untrusted inputs in WASM,
    we really need to support #56733 as there is no right answer
    for the default max depth limit to use since the max wasm
    stack size is determined on a per-system basis.
    
    Updates #71845
