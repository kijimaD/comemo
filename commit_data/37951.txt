+Is the language called Go or Golang?</h3>
+
+<p>
+The language is called Go.
+The "golang" moniker arose because the web site is
+<a href="https://golang.org">golang.org</a>, not
+go.org, which was not available to us.
+Many use the golang name, though, and it is handy as
+a label.
+For instance, the Twitter tag for the language is "#golang".
+The language's name is just plain Go, regardless.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+A side note: Although the
+<a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-brand">official logo</a>
+has two capital letters, the language name is written Go, not GO.
