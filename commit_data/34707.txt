    cmd/compile: finish GOEXPERIMENT=preemptibleloops repair
    
    A newish check for branch-likely on single-successor blocks
    caught a case where the preemption-check inserter was
    setting "likely" on an unconditional branch.
    
    Fixed by checking for that case before setting likely.
    
    Also removed an overconservative restriction on parallel
    compilation for GOEXPERIMENT=preemptibleloops; it works
    fine, it is just another control-flow transformation.
