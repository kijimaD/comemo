    test: a number of fixes.
    
    Details:
    - reorder.go: delete p8.
      (Once expectation is changed per b/4627 it is identical to p1.)
    - switch.go: added some more (degenerate) switches.
    - range.go: improved error messages in a few cases.
    - method.go: added tests of calls to promoted methods.
