    cmd/compile: eliminate copy for static literals
    
    *p = [5]byte{1,2,3,4,5}
    
    First we allocate a global containing the RHS.  Then we copy
    that global to a local stack variable, and then copy that local
    stack variable to *p.  The intermediate copy is unnecessary.
    
    Note that this only works if the RHS is completely constant.
    If the code was:
    *p = [5]byte{1,2,x,4,5}
    this optimization doesn't apply as we have to construct the
    RHS on the stack before copying it to *p.
    
    Fixes #12841
