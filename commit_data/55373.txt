    cmd/link: add debug print in hostobjCopy
    
    In external linking mode, when the external linker fails to handle
    something in a host object file, it usually reports the name of
    the host object which is a copied file named 000NNN.o. This is
    often not helpful to determine what file it is. Add some debug
    print so at least in -v mode it is more helpful.
