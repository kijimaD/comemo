    go spec: follow-up cleanups after communication operator changes
    
    These are syntactical changes to better reflect the communication
    operator's new status in the language.
    
    - sending to a channel is now done via a send statement
    - there is no binary communication operation anymore which
      leads to a reduction of the number of precedence levels
      from 6 to 5 (yeah!)
    - small semantic change: since a send operation is not part
      of the expression syntax anymore, a <- send operator is
      binding weaker than any other operator now
    - receiving from a channel is done as before via the unary
      receive expression
    - communication clauses in select statement now can contain
      send statements or receive expressions
