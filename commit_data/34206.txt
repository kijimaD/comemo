    cmd/asm, cmd/internal/obj/ppc64: add Immediate Shifted opcodes for ppc64x
    
    This change adds ADD/AND/OR/XOR Immediate Shifted instructions for
    ppc64x so they are usable in Go asm code. These instructions were
    originally present in asm9.go, but they were only usable in that
    file (as -AADD, -AANDCC, -AOR, -AXOR). These old mnemonics are now
    removed.
