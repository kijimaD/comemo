    index/suffixarray: revert change from int -> int32
    
    CL 5040041 (https://golang.org/cl/5040041)
    changed the use of []int to []int32 internally so
    that encoding/binary could be used. This is no
    longer needed (gobs can encode ints), and using
    []int is more in sync w/ the semantics of the data
    structure (the index elements are indices which are
    ints). Changing it back.
