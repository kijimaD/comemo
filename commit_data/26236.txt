 // The executable example for time.Format demonstrates the working
 // of the layout string in detail and is a good reference.
+//
+// Note that the RFC822, RFC850, and RFC1123 formats should be applied
+// only to local times. Applying them to UTC times will use "UTC" as the
+// time zone abbreviation, while strictly speaking those RFCs require the
+// use of "GMT" in that case.
+// In general RFC1123Z should be used instead of RFC1123 for servers
+// that insist on that format, and RFC3339 should be preferred for new protocols.
