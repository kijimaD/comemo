    os/signal: derive TestAtomicStop timeout from overall test timeout
    
    Previously, TestAtomicStop used a hard-coded 2-second timeout.
    
    That empirically is not long enough on certain builders. Rather than
    adjusting it to a different arbitrary value, use a slice of the
    overall timeout for the test binary. If everything is working, we
    won't block nearly that long anyway.
    
    Updates #35085
