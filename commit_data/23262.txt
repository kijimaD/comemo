    runtime: Reduce calls to shouldtriggergc
    
    shouldtriggergc is slightly expensive due to the call overhead
    and the use of an atomic. This CL reduces the number of time
    one checks if a GC should be done from one at each allocation
    to once when a span is allocated. Since shouldtriggergc is an
    important abstraction simply hand inlining it, along with its
    atomic instruction would lose the abstraction.
