commit 7d1c5328ed2b0082acdc0b47e6565e4b254e9f8c

    math/rand: Intn etc. should panic if their argument is <= 0.
    
    I am making a unilateral decision here. I could also settle for returning 0,
    as long it's documented, but I argue that it's equivalent to an index
    out of bounds.
    
    Fixes #2892.
