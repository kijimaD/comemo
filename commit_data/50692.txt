    runtime: fix racy stackForceMove check
    
    Currently, newstack loads gp.stackguard0 twice to check for different
    poison values. The race window between these two checks can lead to
    unintentional stack doubling, and ultimately to stack overflows.
    
    Specifically, newstack checks if stackguard0 is stackPreempt first,
    then it checks if it's stackForceMove. If stackguard0 is set to
    stackForceMove on entry, but changes to stackPreempt between the two
    checks, newstack will incorrectly double the stack allocation.
    
    Fix this by loading stackguard0 exactly once and then checking it
    against different poison values.
    
    The effect of this is relatively minor because stackForceMove is only
    used by a small number of runtime tests. I found this because
    mayMorestackMove uses stackForceMove aggressively, which makes this
    failure mode much more likely.
