    regexp/syntax: append patchLists in constant time
    
    By keeping a tail pointer, we can append to a patchList in constant
    time, rather than in time proportional to the length of the list. This
    gets rid of the quadratic compile times we were seeing for long series
    of alternations.
    
    This is basically the same change as
    https://github.com/google/re2/commit/e9d517989f66f2e0a24cde42f4d2424dd3e4a9b9.
    
    Fixes #39542.
