    std: remove unused bits of code all over the place
    
    Some were never used, and some haven't been used for years.
    
    One exception is net/http's readerAndCloser, which was only used in a
    test. Move it to a test file.
    
    While at it, remove a check in regexp that could never fire; the field
    is an uint32, so it can never be negative.
