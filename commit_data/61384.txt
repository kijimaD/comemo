    runtime/pprof: relax TestProfilerStackDepth
    
    The TestProfilerStackDepth/heap test can spuriously fail if the profiler
    happens to capture a stack with an allocation several frames deep into
    runtime code. The pprof API hides runtime frames at the leaf-end of
    stacks, but those frames still count against the profiler's stack depth
    limit. The test checks only the first stack it finds with the desired
    prefix and fails if it's not deep enough or doesn't have the right root
    frame. So it can fail in that scenario, even though the implementation
    isn't really broken.
    
    Relax the test to check that there is at least one stack with desired
    prefix, depth, and root frame.
    
    Fixes #70112
