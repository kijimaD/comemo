    syscall/exec_linux: enable changing controlling tty
    
    As discussed in the following thread:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-dev/emeJffxWhVo
    
    This is required to enable applications such as `less` to use something
    other than stdin as the controlling terminal.
