    net: mptcp: implement dialMPTCP
    
    This function is called when the user has requested MPTCP via
    SetMultipathTCP in the Dialer.
    
    This new function falls back to dialTCP on operating systems that do not
    support MPTCP or if MPTCP is not supported.
    
    On Dialer side, MultipathTCP function can be used to know if the package
    will try to use MPTCP or not when Dial is called.
    
    Note that this new dialMPTCP function returns a TCPConn object, like
    dialTCP. A new MPTCPConn object using the following composition could
    have been returned:
    
        type MPTCPConn struct {
            *TCPConn
        }
    
    But the drawback is that if MPTCP is used by default one day (see #56539
    issue on GitHub), Dial will return a different object: this new
    MPTCPConn type instead of the previously expected TCPConn. This can
    cause issues for apps checking the returned object.
    
    This work has been co-developped by Gregory Detal
    <gregory.detal@tessares.net>.
