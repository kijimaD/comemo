    internal/testenv: remove RunWithTimout
    
    For most tests, the test's deadline itself is more appropriate than an
    arbitrary timeout layered atop of it (especially once #48157 is
    implemented), and testenv.Command already adds cleaner timeout
    behavior when a command would run too close to the test's deadline.
    
    That makes RunWithTimeout something of an attractive nuisance. For
    now, migrate the two existing uses of it to testenv.CommandContext,
    with a shorter timeout implemented using context.WithTimeout.
    
    As a followup, we may want to drop the extra timeouts from these
    invocations entirely.
    
    Updates #50436.
    Updates #37405.
