    cmd/compile: fix load of interface{}-typed OpIData in expand_calls
    
    In certain cases, the declkared type of an OpIData is interface{}.
    This was not expected (since interface{} is a pair, right?) and
    thus caused a crash.  What is intended is that these be treated as
    a byteptr, so do that instead (this is what happens in 1.15).
    
    Fixes #42568.
