    crypto/x509: prevent chain cycles in Verify
    
    It's possible to include a self-signed root certificate as an
    intermediate and push Verify into a loop.
    
    I already had a test for this so I thought that it was ok, but it
    turns out that the test was void because the Verisign root certificate
    doesn't contain the "IsCA" flag and so it wasn't an acceptable
    intermediate certificate for that reason.
