    os: don't hold ForkLock across opens on Plan 9
    
    If os.OpenFile holds ForkLock on files that block opens,
    then threads that simultaneously try to do fork-exec will
    get hung up (until the open succeeds). Blocked opens are
    common enough on Plan 9 that protecting against fd leaks
    into fork-execs means not being able to do fork-execs
    properly in the general case. Thus, we forgo taking the
    lock.
