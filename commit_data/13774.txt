commit ef48dfa310450b54fcb3eb4b33ca43329df7c824
Author: Marcel van Lohuizen <mpvl@golang.org>
Date:   Sat Sep 8 10:46:55 2012 +0900

    exp/locale/collate: added indices to builder for reusing blocks between locales.
    Refactored build + buildTrie into build + buildOrdering.
    Note that since the tailoring code is not checked in yet, all tailorings are identical
    to root.  The table therefore should not and does not grow at this point.
