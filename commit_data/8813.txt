    8l: more fixes for Plan 9
    
    Once these changes are effected, it is possible to construct
    "8l" native on a (386?) Plan 9 system, albeit with assistance
    from modules such as mkfiles that are not (yet) included in any
    public patches.
    
    8l/asm.c:
    . Corrected some format qualifiers.
    
    8l/list.c:
    . Cast a print() argument to (int) to match the given format.
      It may be possible to change the format (%R), but I have not
      looked into it.
    
    8l/obj.c:
    . Removed some unused code.
    
    8l/span.c:
    . Removed unnecessary incrementation on "bp".
    . Corrected some format qualifiers.
    
    ld/data.c:
    . Corrected some format qualifiers.
    . Cast print argument to (int): used as field size.
    . Use braces to suppress warning about empty if() statements.
    
    ld/dwarf.c:
    . Trivial spelling mistake in comment.
    
    ld/ldelf.c:
    . Added USED() statements to silence warnings.
    . Dropped redundant address (&) operators.
    . corrected some format qualifiers.
    . Cast to (int) for switch selection variable.
    
    ld/macho.c:
    . Added USED() statements to silence warnings.
    
    ld/ldpe.c:
    . Added USED() statements to silence warnings.
    . More careful use of "sect" variable.
    . Corrected some format qualifiers.
    . Removed redundant assignments.
    . Minor fix dropped as it was submitted separately.
    
    ld/pe.c:
    . Dropped <time.h> which is now in <u.h>.
    . Dropped redundant address (&) operators.
    . Added a missing variable initialisation.
    
    ld/symtab.c:
    . Added USED() statements to silence warnings.
    . Removed redundant incrementation.
    . Corrected some format qualifiers.
    
    All the above have been tested against a (very) recent release
    and do not seem to trigger any regressions.
    
    All review suggestions have been incorporated.
