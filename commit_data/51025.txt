    math/big: improve performance of Binomial
    
    This change improves the performance of Binomial by implementing an
    algorithm that produces smaller intermediate values at each step.
    
    Working with smaller big.Int values has the advantage that  fewer allocations
    and computations are required for each mathematical operation.
    
    The algorithm used is the Multiplicative Formula, which is a well known
    way of calculating the Binomial coefficient and is described at:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Multiplicative_formula
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#In_programming_languages
    
    In addition to that, an optimization has been made to remove a
    redundant computation of (i+1) on each loop which has a measurable
    impact when using big.Int.
    
    Performance improvement measured on an M1 MacBook Pro
    running the existing benchmark for Binomial:
    
    name        old time/op    new time/op    delta
    Binomial-8     589ns ± 0%     435ns ± 0%  -26.05%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    
    name        old alloc/op   new alloc/op   delta
    Binomial-8    1.02kB ± 0%    0.08kB ± 0%  -92.19%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    
    name        old allocs/op  new allocs/op  delta
    Binomial-8      38.0 ± 0%       5.0 ± 0%  -86.84%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
