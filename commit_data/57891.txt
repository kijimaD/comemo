    cmd/cgo: silence unaligned-access
    
    Clang 14+ introduced a warning when using mixed packed and unpacked structs.
    This can cause problems when taking an address of the unpacked struct, which
    may end up having a different alignment than expected.
    
    This is not a problem in cgo, which does not take pointers from the packed
    struct.
    
    Fixes #62480
