    test: fix fixedbugs/issue30908.go to work with no-opt builder
    
    Update the issue 30908 test to work with the no-opt builder
    (this requires a corresponding change in the linker as well).
    As part of this change, 'rundir' tests are now linked without
    passing "-w" to the linker.
    
    Updates #30908.
    Fixes #31034.
