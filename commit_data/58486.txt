    cmd/go/internal/modindex: don't write index entry if file open
    
    On Windows, we can't open a file that's already been opened. Before this
    change, we'd try to write an index entry if mmapping the entry failed.
    But that could happen either if the file doesn't exist or if there was a
    problem mmapping an already opened file. Pass through information about
    whether the file was actually opened so that we don't try to write to an
    already opened file.
    
    For #71059
