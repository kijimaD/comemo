    runtime: avoid variable/function alias on runtime._cgo_panic_internal
    
    The symbol runtime._cgo_panic_internal is defined both as a function
    in package runtime and as a (linknamed) variable in package
    runtime/cgo. Since we're introducing function ABIs, this is going to
    cause problems with resolving the ABI-marked function symbol with the
    unmarked data symbol. It's also confusing.
    
    Fix this by declaring runtime._cgo_panic_internal as a function in
    runtime/cgo as well and extracting the PC from the function object.
    
    For #27539.
