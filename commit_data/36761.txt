    Revert "internal/trace: change Less to make sorting events deterministice"
    
    This reverts commit 1764609b8b245323210eab39c4b586291d3a45a5.
    
    Reason for revert: It breaks the dragonfly trybot, in which there are sometimes (non-deterministically) Events with the same timestamp that have to occur in a specific order.
