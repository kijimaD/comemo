    cmd/dist: do not reinstall runtime/cgo with -tags lldb on ios builders
    
    The cache will take care of keeping go test -tags lldb fast.
    Installing runtime/cgo this way just makes all the checkNotStale
    tests think runtime/cgo is out of date.
    
    Should fix ios builders.
    
    Fixes #22509.
