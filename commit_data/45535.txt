    cmd/compile: establish regabi name/value mapping for small in-params
    
    When the expand_calls phase in the SSA backend lowers prolog OpArg
    values into OpArgIntReg/OpArgFloatReg values, we don't always record
    the assocation between the new lowered value and the parameter name.
    
    This patch handles the simple case where a given parameter fits into
    exactly one register; in this scenario it makes sense to manufacture a
    new pseudo-slot for the value that points to the param, and install
    the slot/value mapping in the NamedValues table for the function. More
    work will be needed to deal with params that span multiple registers;
    that will need to be addressed in a subsequent patch.
    
    This change improves the parameter error rate "optargorder" benchmark
    by about 7-8% (when run on the optargorder binary).
    
    Updates #45945.
