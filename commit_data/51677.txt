    runtime: fix 32B backward copy on ppc64x
    
    The test to enter the 32b copy loop always fails, and execution
    falls back to a single 8B/iteration copy loop for copies of more
    than 7 bytes. Likewise, the 32B loop has SRC/DST args mixed,
    and fails to truncate DWORDS after completing.
    
    Fix these, and unroll the 8B/iteration loop as it will only
    execute 1-3 times if reached.
