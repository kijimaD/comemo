    cmd/asm: fix operand order of ARM's MULA instruction
    
    As discussion in issue #19141, the addend should be the third
    argument of MULA. This patch fixes it in both the front end
    and the back end of the assembler. And also tests are added to
    the encoding test.
    
    Fixes #19141
