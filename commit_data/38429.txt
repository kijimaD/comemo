    text/template/parse: simplify Tree.pipeline
    
    The pipeline parsing code was unnecessarily complex. It used a for loop
    with a trailing break, a complex switch, and up to seven levels of
    indentation.
    
    Instead, drop the loop in favor of a single named goto with a comment,
    and flatten out the complex switch to be easier to follow. Two lines of
    code are now duplicated, but they're simple and only three lines apart.
    
    While at it, move the pipe initialization further up to remove the need
    for three variables.
