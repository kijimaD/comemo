    cmd/compile/internal/amd64: fix for coverage testing
    
    Fix up a unit test to make it more friendly for coverage runs.
    Currently on tip if you do
    
       cd ${GOROOT}/src ; go test -cover cmd/compile/...
    
    it will cause a failure in the TestGoAMD64v1 testpoint of
    cmd/compile/internal/amd64, the reason being that this testpoint
    copies and reruns the test executable, expecting the rerun to produce
    only the output "PASS", whereas if "-cover" is used, the output will
    include percentage of statements covered as well. To fix, rework the
    test to tolerate additional output if coverage is enabled.
