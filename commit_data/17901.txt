commit 85138da832f8740bee9241e80acb291a4954a10a
Author: Keith Randall <khr@golang.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 2 13:36:50 2013 -0800

    reflect: prevent the callXX routines from calling makeFuncStub
    and methodValueCall directly.  Instead, we inline their behavior
    inside of reflect.call.
    
    This change is required because otherwise we have a situation where
    reflect.callXX calls makeFuncStub, neither of which knows the
    layout of the args passed between them.  That's bad for
    precise gc & stack copying.
    
    Fixes #6619.
