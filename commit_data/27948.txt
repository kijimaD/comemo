    testing: add matching of subtest
    
    Allows passing regexps per subtest to --test.run and --test.bench
    
    Note that the documentation explicitly states that the split regular
    expressions match the correpsonding parts (path components) of
    the bench/test identifier. This is intended and slightly different
    from the i'th RE matching the subtest/subbench at the respective
    level.  Picking this semantics allows guaranteeing that a test or
    benchmark identifier as printed by go test can be passed verbatim
    (possibly quoted) to, respectively, -run or -bench: subtests and
    subbenches might have a '/' in their name, causing a misaligment if
    their ID is passed to -run or -bench as is.
    This semantics has other benefits, but this is the main motivation.
    
    Fixes golang.go#15126
