    encoding/binary: hide TotalSize
    
    The function has a bizarre signature: it was the only public function there
    that exposed the reflect package. Also, its definition is peculiar and hard to
    explain. It doesn't merit being exported.
    
    This is an API change but really, it should never have been exported and
    it's certain very few programs will depend on it: it's too weird.
    
    Fixes #2846.
