    cmd/compile: reduce element size of arrays in sparse{map,set}
    
    sparseSet and sparseMap only need 32 bit integers in their
    arrays, since a sparseEntry key is also limited to 32 bits.
    This appears to reduce the space allocated for at least
    one pathological compilation by 1%, perhaps more.
    
    Not necessarily for 1.7, but it saves a little and is very
    low-risk.
