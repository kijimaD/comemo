    testing: always ReadMemStats before first benchmark run
    
    If the only way the user indicates they want alloc stats shown
    is via ReportAllocs, we don't know that until benchFunc is run.
    Therefore, StopTimer's ReadMemStats will return incorrect data
    for single cycle runs since there's no counterpart ReadMemStats from
    StartTimer that initializes alloc stats.
    
    It appears that this bug was introduced by CL 46612,
    "testing: only call ReadMemStats if necessary when benchmarking"
    
    Fixes #20590
