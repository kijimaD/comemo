    io/fs: allow backslash in ValidPath, reject in os.DirFS.Open
    
    Rejecting backslash introduces problems with presenting
    underlying OS file systems that contain names with backslash.
    Rejecting backslash also does not Windows-proof the syntax,
    because colon can also be a path separator. And we are not
    going to reject colon from all names. So don't reject backslash
    either.
    
    There is a similar problem on Windows with names containing
    slashes, but those are more difficult (though not impossible)
    to create.
    
    Also document and enforce that paths must be UTF-8.
    
    Fixes #44166.
