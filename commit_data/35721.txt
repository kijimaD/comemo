    test: in asmcheck, dump only the functions which fail
    
    Before this change, in case of any failure, asmcheck was
    dumping to stderr the whole output of compile -S, which
    can be very long if it contains multiple functions.
    
    Make it so it filters the output to only display the
    assembly output of functions for which at least one opcode
    check failed. This greatly simplifies debugging.
