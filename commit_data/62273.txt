    runtime: use return for async preemption resumption on arm64
    
    Use return with register for async preemption resumption on arm64.
    This has the same behaviour as the current use of JMP, however
    is permitted when Branch Target Identification is being enforced,
    while a JMP with register is considered an indirect call and
    requires a `BTI J` marker at the resumption address.
    
    Updates #66054
