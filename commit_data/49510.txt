    os/user: don't skip TestLookupGroup if supported
    
    CL 37664 implemented this functionality, yet the tests were skipped.
    
    Introduce and use additional variable groupListImplemented to
    distinguish between these cases and enable TestLookupGroup for
    supported configurations (which looks like all but plan9).
