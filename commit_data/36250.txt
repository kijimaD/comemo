    net: implement (*syscall.RawConn).Read/Write on Windows
    
    RawRead assumes the callback will perform either (a) a blocking read
    and always return true, (b) a blocking read with a SO_RCVTIMEO set
    returning false on WSAETIMEDOUT, or (c) a non-blocking read
    returning false on WSAEWOULDBLOCK. In the latter two cases, it uses
    a 0-byte overlapped read for notifications from the IOCP runtime
    when the socket becomes readable before trying again.
    
    RawWrite assumes the callback will perform blocking write and will
    always return true, and makes no effort to tie into the runtime loop.
