    cmd/go/internal/mvs: don't emit duplicates from Req
    
    Req is supposed to return “a minimal requirement list”
    that includes each of the module paths listed in base.
    Currently, if base contains duplicates Req emits duplicates,
    and a list containing duplicates is certainly not minimal.
    
    That, in turn, requires callers to be careful to deduplicate the base
    slice, and there are multiple callers that are already quite
    complicated to reason about even without the added complication of
    deduplicating slices.
    
    For #36460
