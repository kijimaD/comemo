    godoc: remove uses of container/vector
    
    In the process, rewrite index.go to use slices instead
    of vectors, rewrite for-loops into range loops, and
    generally simplify code (this code was written before
    the launch of go and showed its age).
    
    Also, fix a wrong import in appinit.go.
    
    No significant performance changes (improvements);
    most of time is spent elsewhere (measured on an stand-
    alone MacBook Pro with SSD disk, running standard
    godoc settings: godoc -v -http=:7777 -index).
