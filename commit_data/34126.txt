    runtime: fix using fastrand in sema.go
    
    Before CL 62530 fastrand always returned non-zero value, and one
    condition in sema.go depends on this behavior.
    
    fastrand is used to generate random weight for treap of sudog, and
    it is checked against zero to verify sudog were inserted into treap or
    wait queue.
    
    Since its precision is not very important for correctness, lets just
    always set its lowest bit in this place.
