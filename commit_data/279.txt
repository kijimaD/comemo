commit de5442893ddb8a4e0374a2c9a5e5b58d2f5523bd
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 3 13:19:07 2008 -0700

    A small but powerful change in constant declarations. Proposal by ken
    after some discussion about enums. Implementation should be trivial.
    Wording in the doc should be improved, probably.
