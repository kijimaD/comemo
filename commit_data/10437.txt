    misc/windows packager development intermediate check-in
    
    The installer now: allows a user to select an alternative
    install directory, it now adds a Go folder to the Programs
    Menu, and it places two shortcuts on the user's desktop.
    The Program Menu folder contains shortcuts to the uninstaller
    and two batch files, go.bat and godoc.bat. The desktop
    shortcuts also point to go.bat and godoc.bat.
    
    go.bat sets the Go environment, including Path, and spawns a
    Window's shell. godoc.bat starts the godoc server at
    localhost:6060 then spawns a browser window pointing to the
    document server.
    
    Setting the environment temporarily and spawning a shell, via
    go.bat, should be safer than messing with the system's environment
    and it makes the user experience a bit more streamlined.
    
    The packager does work in its current state but it still needs
    some polishing. And yes, the plan is to add a dialogue to allow
    the user to decline the desktop shortcuts.
