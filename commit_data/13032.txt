    runtime, misc/cgo/test: fix build for Linux/ARM
    1. In CL 5989057, I made a mistake in the last minute change.
    "MOVW.W R4, -4(SP)" should really be "MOVW.W R4, -4(R13)",
    as 5l will rewrite offset for SP.
    2. misc/cgo/test/issue1560.go tests for parallel sleep of 1s,
    but on ARM, the deadline is frequently missed, so change sleep
    time to 2s on ARM.
