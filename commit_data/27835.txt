    cmd/go: deduplicate gccgo afiles by package path, not *Package
    
    This code was fixed a while ago to ensure that xtest and fake packages came
    first on the link line, but golang.org/cl/16775 added --whole-archive ...
    --no-whole-archive around all the .a files and rendered this fix useless.
    
    So, take a different approach and only put one .a file on the linker command
    line for each ImportPath we see while traversing the action graph, not for each
    *Package we see. The way we walk the graph ensures that we'll see the .a files
    that need to be first first.
