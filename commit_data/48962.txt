    internal/bytealg: improve PPC64 equal
    
    Rewrite the vector loop to process 64B per iteration,
    this greatly improves performance on POWER9/POWER10 for
    large sizes.
    
    Likewise, use a similar tricks for sizes >= 8 and <= 64.
    
    And, rewrite small comparisons, it's a little slower for 1 byte,
    but constant time for 1-7 bytes. Thus, it is increasingly faster
    for 2-7B.
    
    Benchmarks results below are from P8/P9 ppc64le (in that order),
    several additional testcases have been added to test interesting
    sizes. Likewise, the old variant was padded to the same code
    size of the new variant to minimize layout related noise:
