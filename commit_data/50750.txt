    cmd/link/internal/ld: panic if inlined functions missing FuncInfo
    
    All inlined functions are Go functions, and thus should be capable of
    having a FuncInfo. Missing FuncInfo is likely indication of a compiler
    bug that dropped the symbol too early, failing to add it to the symbol
    list used for writing output. I believe all existing cases have been
    fixed; this check will prevent regressions.
    
    The exception is -linkshared mode. There symbols are loaded from the
    shared library, and the FuncInfo is not available. This is a bug, as it
    can result in incorrect the FuncID in inlinedCall, but it is very
    involved to fix.
    
    For #54959.
    For #55954.
