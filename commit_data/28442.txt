    compress/flate: simplify using subtests and sub-benchmarks
    
    This causes the large files to be loaded only once per benchmark.
    
    This CL also serves as an example use case of sub(tests|-benchmarks).
    
    This CL ensures that names are identical to the original
    except for an added slashes. Things could be
    simplified further if this restriction were dropped.
