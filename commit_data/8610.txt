    8l, ld: Initial adjustments for Plan 9 native compilation of 8l
    
    These changes are not particularly invasive and have been tested
    as broadly as possible.
    
    8l/l.h:
      -     #pragma varargck: added some, removed duplicates.
    
    ld/dwarf.c:
      -     As Plan 9 has no NULL, changed all occurrences to nil.
      -     Added USED(size); where necessary.
      -     Added (void) argument in definition of finddebugruntimepath().
      -     Plan 9 compiler was complaining about multiple
            assignments, repeaired by breaking up the commands.
      -     Correction: havedynamic = 1; restored.
    
    ld/go.c:
      -     Needed USED(file); in two functions.
      -     Removed unused assignments flagged by the Plan 9 compiler.
    
    ld/lib.c:
      -     Replaced unlink() with remove() which seems available everywhere.
      -     Removed USED(c4); and USED(magic) no longer required.
      -     Removed code flagged as unused by the Plan 9 compiler.
      -     Added attributes to a number of format strings.
