    runtime: do not trace past jmpdefer during pprof traceback on arm
    
    jmpdefer modifies PC, SP, and LR, and not atomically,
    so walking past jmpdefer will often end up in a state
    where the three are not a consistent execution snapshot.
    This was causing warning messages a few frames later
    when the traceback realized it was confused, but given
    the right memory it could easily crash instead.
    
    Update #8153
