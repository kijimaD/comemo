    encoding/asn1: be stricter by reserialising parsed times.
    
    The time package does normalisation of times: for example day zero is
    converted to the last day of the previous month and the 31st of February
    is moved into March etc. This makes the ASN.1 parsing a little
    worryingly lax.
    
    This change causes the parser to reserialise parsed times to ensure that
    they round-trip correctly and thus were not normalised.
    
    Fixes #11134.
