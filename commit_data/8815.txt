    godefs: remove test from build
    
    The test is only defined on darwin/amd64, and it fails
    with recent versions of Xcode, which do not support
    -gstabs+ debugging output.  At some point godefs will
    have to be replaced, perhaps merged with cgo.
    Godefs is not needed during builds anyway (its output files
    are checked into the repository in src/pkg/runtime),
    so its failure on the newer Xcode is a distraction from an
    otherwise usable build.  Disable the test.
    
    Fixes #1985.
