    cmd/internal/cov: close counter data files eagerly
    
    When reading the counter data files from a given pod, close the
    underlying *os.File immediately after each one is read, as opposed to
    using a deferred close in the loop (which will close them all at the
    end of the function). Doing things this way avoids running into "too
    many open files" when processing large clumps of counter data files.
    
    Fixes #68468.
