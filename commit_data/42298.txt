    net/http: make Transport.IdleConnTimeout consider wall (not monotonic) time
    
    Both laptops closing their lids and cloud container runtimes
    suspending VMs both faced the problem where an idle HTTP connection
    used by the Transport could be cached for later reuse before the
    machine is frozen, only to wake up many minutes later to think that
    their HTTP connection was still good (because only a second or two of
    monotonic time passed), only to find out that the peer hung up on them
    when they went to write.
    
    HTTP/1 connection reuse is inherently racy like this, but no need for
    us to step into a trap if we can avoid it. Also, not everybody sets
    Request.GetBody to enable re-tryable POSTs. And we can only safely
    retry requests in some cases.
    
    So with this CL, before reusing an old connection, double check the walltime.
    
    Testing was done both with a laptop (closing the lid for a bit) and
    with QEMU, running "stop" and "cont" commands in the monitor and
    sending QMP guest agent commands to update its wall clock after the
    "cont":
    
    echo '{"execute":"guest-set-time"}' | socat STDIN UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/qemu-server/108.qga
    
    In both cases, I was running
    https://gist.github.com/bradfitz/260851776f08e4bc4dacedd82afa7aea and
    watching that the RemoteAddr changed after resume.
    
    It's kinda difficult to write an automated test for. I gave a lightning talk on
    using pure emulation user mode qemu for such tests:

       https://github.com/google/embiggen-disk/blob/master/integration_test.go
    
    ... that would probably be a good direction if we want an automated
    test here. But I don't have time to do that now.
    
    Updates #29308 (HTTP/2 remains)
