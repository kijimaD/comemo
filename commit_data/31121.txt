    crypto/x509: add test for v1 intermediates.
    
    X.509v1 certificates are ancient and should be dead. (They are even
    prohibited by the Baseline requirements, section 7.1.1.)
    
    However, there are a number of v1 roots from the 1990's that are still
    in operation. Thus crypto/x509.Certificate.CheckSignatureFrom allows
    X.509v1 certificates to sign other certificates.
    
    The chain building code, however, only allows v1 certificates to sign
    others if they're a root. This change adds a test to check that.
