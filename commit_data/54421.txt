    net/http: mapping data structure
    
    Our goal for the new ServeMux patterns is to match the routing
    performance of the existing ServeMux patterns. To achieve that
    we needed to optimize lookup for small maps.
    
    This CL introduces a simple data structure called a mapping that
    optimizes lookup by using a slice for small collections of key-value
    pairs, switching to a map when the collection gets large.
    
    Mappings are a core part of the routing algorithm, which uses a
    decision tree to match path elements.   The children of a tree node are
    held in a mapping.
