    runtime: relax preemption assertion during stack split
    
    The case can happen when starttheworld is calling acquirep
    to get things moving again and acquirep gets preempted.
    The stack trace is in golang.org/issue/6644.
    
    It is difficult to build a short test case for this, but
    the person who reported issue 6644 confirms that this
    solves the problem.
    
    Fixes #6644.
