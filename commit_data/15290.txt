    runtime: fix sigaction struct on freebsd
    
    Fix the sa_mask member of the sigaction struct - on FreeBSD this is
    declared as a sigset_t, which is an array of four unsigned ints.
    Replace the current int64 with Sigset from defs_freebsd_GOARCH, which
    has the correct definition.
    
    Unbreaks the FreeBSD builds.
