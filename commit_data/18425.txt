    syscall: make use of signed char explicit in generating z-files on freebsd/arm
    
    This CL is in preparation to make cgo work on freebsd/arm.
    
    The signedness of C char might be a problem when we make bare syscall
    APIs, Go structures, using built-in bootstrap scripts with cgo because
    they do translate C stuff to Go stuff internally. For now almost all
    the C compilers assume that the type of char will be unsigned on arm
    by default but it makes a different view from amd64, 386.
    
    This CL just passes -fsigned-char, let the type of char be signed,
    option which is supported on both gcc and clang to the underlying C
    compilers through cgo for avoiding such inconsistency on syscall API.
