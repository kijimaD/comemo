    cmd/internal/obj/x86: still use (fake) local exec TLS mode on android/386
    
    golang.org/cl/16383 broke android/386 because by a sort of confluence of hacks
    no TLS relocations were emitted at all when Flag_shared != 0. The hack in
    runtime/cgo works as well in a PIE executable as it does with a position
    dependent one, so the simplest fix is to still emit a R_TLS_LE reloc when goos
    == "android".
    
    A real fix is to use something more like the IE model code but loading the
    offset from %gs to the thread local storage from a global variable rather than
    from a location chosen by the system linker (this is how android/arm works).
    
    Issue #9327.
