    [dev.unified] cmd/compile/internal/noder: remove needType logic
    
    This logic is a holdover from very early on when it wasn't as clear
    how we would handle dictionary entries for derived types, particularly
    ones that are emitted during desugaring.
    
    However, the current plan is to explicitly wire runtime type info
    through IR nodes, so we can drop this logic.
    
    Notably, the "needed" bit is exposed to the go/types importers, so
    removing it would break the x/tools importer. To minimize churn for
    now, we can just leave the bools in place.
