    [release-branch.go1.23] runtime: store bp on cgocallback as unsafe.Pointer
    
    As of CL 580255, the runtime tracks the frame pointer (or base pointer,
    bp) when entering syscalls, so that we can use fpTracebackPCs on
    goroutines that are sitting in syscalls. That CL mostly got things
    right, but missed one very subtle detail.
    
    When calling from Go->C->Go, the goroutine stack performing the calls
    when returning to Go is free to move around in memory due to growth,
    shrinking, etc. But upon returning back to C, it needs to restore
    gp.syscall*, including gp.syscallsp and gp.syscallbp. The way syscallsp
    currently gets updated is automagically: it's stored as an
    unsafe.Pointer on the stack so that it shows up in a stack map. If the
    stack ever moves, it'll get updated correctly. But gp.syscallbp isn't
    saved to the stack as an unsafe.Pointer, but rather as a uintptr, so it
    never gets updated! As a result, in rare circumstances, fpTracebackPCs
    can correctly try to use gp.syscallbp as the starting point for the
    traceback, but the value is stale.
    
    This change fixes the problem by just storing gp.syscallbp to the stack
    on cgocallback as an unsafe.Pointer, like gp.syscallsp. It also adds a
    comment documenting this subtlety; the lack of explanation for the
    unsafe.Pointer type on syscallsp meant this detail was missed -- let's
    not miss it again in the future.
    
    Now, we have a fix, what about a test? Unfortunately, testing this is
    going to be incredibly annoying because the circumstances under which
    gp.syscallbp are actually used for traceback are non-deterministic and
    hard to arrange, especially from within testprogcgo where we don't have
    export_test.go and can't reach into the runtime.
    
    So, instead, add a gp.syscallbp check to reentersyscall and
    entersyscallblock that mirrors the gp.syscallbp consistency check. This
    probably causes some miniscule slowdown to the syscall path, but it'll
    catch the issue without having to actually perform a traceback.
    
    For #69085.
    Fixes #69087.
