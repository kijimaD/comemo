    runtime/pprof: document SetCPUProfile with c-archive/c-shared
    
    When using c-archive/c-shared, the signal handler for SIGPROF will not
    be installed, which means that runtime/pprof.StartCPUProfile won't work.
    There is no really good solution here, as the main program may want to
    do its own profiling.  For now, just document that runtime/pprof doesn't
    work as expected, but that it will work if you use Notify to install the
    Go signal handler.
    
    Fixes #14043.
