    cmd/compile: insert ' ' and \n at beginning of walkprint
    
    Rather than emitting spaces and newlines for println
    as we walk the expression, construct it all up front.
    This enables further optimizations.
    
    This requires using printstring instead of print in
    the implementation of printsp and printnl,
    on pain of infinite recursion.
    That's ok; it's more efficient anyway, and just as simple.
    While we're here, do it for other print routines as well.
