    cmd/go: document GOBIN and 'go install' locations
    
    * In doc/install-source.html, clarify the meaning of $GOBIN and
      describe where executables from the Go distribution are
      installed. Also describe $GOPATH, since it provides a default value
      for $GOBIN and may conflict with $GOROOT.
    * Add more detail to 'go help install' as well.
    
    Fixes #31576
