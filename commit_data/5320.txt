commit 1c0c252880112892427bb4ba55968a2fceef95ef

    6l, 8l: include ELF header in PT_LOAD mapping for text segment
    
    Due to page boundary rounding, the header would have
    been loaded as part of the text segment already, but this
    change placates the "paxctl" tool on so-called hardened
    Linux distributions (as if normal distributions weren't already
    hard enough to use).
