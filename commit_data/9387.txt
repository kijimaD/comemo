commit 1d8f822c170891ac72e85020178c27aded27c644
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>

    url: new package
    This is just moving the URL code from package http into its own package,
    which has been planned for a while.
    Besides clarity, this also breaks a nascent dependency cycle the new template
    package was about to introduce.
    
    Add a gofix module, url, and use it to generate changes outside http and url.
    
    Sadness about the churn, gladness about some of the naming improvements.
