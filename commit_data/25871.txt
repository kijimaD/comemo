    cmd/compile: Drop references to Prog structs after each function
    
    Don't accumulate a massive list of Prog structs during
    compilation and write them all out at the end of compilation.
    Instead, convert them to code+relocs (or data+relocs) after each
    function is compiled.
    
    Track down a few other places that were keeping Progs alive
    and nil them out so the Progs get GCd promptly.
    
    Saves ~20% in peak memory usage for the compiler.  Surprisingly not much
    help speed-wise (only because we end up doing more GCs.  With a
    compensating GOGC=120, it does help a bit), but this provides a base for
    more changes (e.g. reusing a cache of Progs).
