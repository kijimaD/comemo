    cmd/go: avoid use of 'go tool pack'
    
    All packages now use the -pack option to the compiler.
    For a pure Go package, that's enough.
    For a package with additional C and assembly files, the extra
    archive entries can be added directly (by concatenation)
    instead of by invoking go tool pack.
    
    These changes make it possible to rewrite cmd/pack in Go.
