    crypto/tls: only store a single nonce for AES-GCM.
    
    Although an AEAD, in general, can be used concurrently in both the seal
    and open directions, TLS is easier. Since the transport keys are
    different for different directions in TLS, an AEAD will only ever be
    used in one direction. Thus we don't need separate buffers for seal and
    open because they can never happen concurrently.
    
    Also, fix the nonce size to twelve bytes since the fixed-prefix
    construction for AEADs is superseded and will never be used for anything
    else now.
