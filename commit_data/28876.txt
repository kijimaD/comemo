    net/http: deflake BenchmarkClient and its use of a fixed port for testing
    
    Let the kernel pick a port for testing, and have the server in the
    child process tell the parent (benchmarking) process the port that
    was selected.
    
    Fixes flakes like seen in https://golang.org/cl/27050 (and previously)
