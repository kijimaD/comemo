    gc: unify stack frame layout
    
    allocparams + tempname + compactframe
    all knew about how to place stack variables.
    
    Now only compactframe, renamed to allocauto,
    does the work.  Until the last minute, each PAUTO
    variable is in its own space and has xoffset == 0.
    
    This might break 5g.  I get failures in concurrent
    code running under qemu and I can't tell whether
    it's 5g's fault or qemu's.  We'll see what the real
    ARM builders say.
