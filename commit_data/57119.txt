    crypto/x509: tolerate multiple matching chains in testVerify
    
    Due to the semantics of roots, a root store may contain two valid roots
    that have the same subject (but different SPKIs) at the asme time. As
    such in testVerify it is possible that when we verify a certificate we
    may get two chains that has the same stringified representation.
    
    Rather than doing something fancy to include keys (which is just overly
    complicated), tolerate multiple matches.
    
    Fixes #60925
