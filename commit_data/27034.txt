    math/big: more tests, documentation for Flot gob marshalling
    
    Follow-up to https://golang.org/cl/21755.
    This turned out to be a bit more than just a few nits
    as originally expected in that CL.
    
    1) The actual mantissa may be shorter than required for the
       given precision (because of trailing 0's): no need to
       allocate space for it (and transmit 0's). This can save
       a lot of space when the precision is high: E.g., for
       prec == 1000, 16 words or 128 bytes are required at the
       most, but if the actual number is short, it may be much
       less (for the test cases present, it's significantly less).
    
    2) The actual mantissa may be longer than the number of
       words required for the given precision: make sure to
       not overflow when encoding in bytes.
    
    3) Add more documentation.
    
    4) Add more tests.
