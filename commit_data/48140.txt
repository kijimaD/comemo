    spec: introduce notion of basic interface, misc. fine-tuning
    
    A basic interface is a classical Go interface containing only
    methods or embedding basic interfaces.
    
    Use this to simplify rule about what interfaces may be used
    where. The term "basic interface" will also be useful when
    talking about various interfaces in general.
    
    Fix rule restricting union terms: as it was written it also
    excluded interface terms with non-empty method sets due to
    embedded non-interface types with methods.
    
    Split the large section on interfaces into three smaller
    pieces by introducing section titles.
