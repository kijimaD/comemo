    cmd/compile: avoid allocating a Nodes for readonly method receivers
    
    We were allocating a Nodes for common method calls
    that did not modify the Nodes.
    Though there is no clear wall time impact,
    this significantly reduces the number of allocations,
    so it seems worth doing.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp.
