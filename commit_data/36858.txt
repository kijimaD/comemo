    runtime: clarify table of arena sizes
    
    Currently the table of arena sizes mixes the number of entries in the
    L1 with the size of the L2. While the size of the L2 is important,
    this makes it hard to see what's actually going on because there's an
    implicit factor of sys.PtrSize.
    
    This changes the L2 column to say both the number of entries and the
    size that results in. This should hopefully make the relations between
    the columns of the table clearer, since they can now be plugged
    directly into the given formula.
