    cmd/addr2line, cmd/objdump: fix on amd64 Plan 9
    
    Fix virtual address of the start of the text segment
    on amd64 Plan 9.
    
    This issue has been partially fixed in cmd/add2line,
    as part of CL 106460044, but we forgot to report the
    change to cmd/objdump.
    
    In the meantime, we also fixed the textStart address
    in both cmd/add2line and cmd/objdump.
