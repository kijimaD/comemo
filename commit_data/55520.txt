    cmd/compile: consistently use s.pp in genssa
    
    In genssa, s.pp == pp, so using either is equivalent, but use is
    inconsistent. About half of the uses use s.pp and the other half use pp.
    
    This gets confusing, especially when two different uses are right next
    to each other, because it implies that these might be different.
    
    Pick one and use it consistently.
