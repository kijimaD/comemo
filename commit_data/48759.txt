    cmd/internal/sys: mark windows/arm64 as c-shared-capable
    
    The platform supports c-shared now, so flip this on. I've given this a
    small smoke test using [1], and it was able to pass packets and
    generally function well. Since [1] uses quite a bit of Go functionality
    under the hood, I think it's a decent test that a lot of things that
    should be working are working. So this commit enables it.
