    cmd/compile: don't use statictmps for SSA-able composite literals
    
    The writebarrier test has to change.
    Now that T23 composite literals are passed to the backend,
    they get SSA'd, so writes to their fields are treated separately,
    so the relevant part of the first write to t23 is now a dead store.
    Preserve the intent of the test by splitting it up into two functions.
    
    Reduces code size a bit:
