-// Simple logging package. It defines a type, Logger, with simple
-// methods for formatting output to one or two destinations. It also
-// has a predefined 'standard' Logger accessible through helper
-// functions Print[f|ln], Exit[f|ln], and Panic[f|ln], which are
-// easier to use than creating a Logger manually.  That logger writes
-// to standard error and prints the date and time of each logged
