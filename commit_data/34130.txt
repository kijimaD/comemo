    cmd/link: sniff runtime-gdb.py path from runtime/proc.go
    
    Currently the linker figures out where runtime-gdb.py should be by
    looking for the path to runtime/debug.go. However, debug.go contains
    only a few symbols and can easily get dead-code eliminated entirely,
    especially from simple binaries. When this happens, the resulting
    binary lacks a reference to runtime-gdb.py, so the GDB helpers don't
    get loaded.
    
    Fix this by instead sniffing for runtime/proc.go. This contains
    runtime.main and the scheduler, so it's not going anywhere.
