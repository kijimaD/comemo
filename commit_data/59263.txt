    runtime: merge timerRemoving into timerModifying
    
    timerRemoving is just a kind of "locked for modification",
    so merge it into timerModifying. This does potentially remove
    a fast path from deltimer, in that deltimer of timerRemoving
    is a fast-path exit while deltimer of timerModifying has to
    wait for the timer to settle. Since all the timerModifying
    critical paths are bounded and short, this should not matter.
    
    This is part of a larger simplification of the state set.
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
