    encoding/asn1: fix explicitly tagged Times.
    
    https://golang.org/cl/153770043/ tried to fix the case where a
    implicitly tagged Time, that happened to have the same tag as
    GENERALIZEDTIME, shouldn't be parsed as a GENERALIZEDTIME.
    
    It did so, mistakenly, by testing whether params.tag != nil. But
    explicitly tagged values also have a non-nil tag and there the inner
    tag actually does encode the type of the value.
    
    This change instead tests whether the tag class is UNIVERSAL before
    assuming that the tag contains type information.
