    net/http: optimize some io.Copy calls by reusing buffers
    
    Optimize two calls of io.Copy which cannot make use of neither
    io.ReaderFrom nor io.WriterTo optimization tricks by replacing them with
    io.CopyBuffer with reusable buffers.
    
    First is fallback call to io.Copy when server misses the optimized case
    of using sendfile to copy from a regular file to net.TCPConn; second is
    use of io.Copy on piped reader/writer when handler implementation uses
    http.CloseNotifier interface. One of the notable users of
    http.CloseNotifier is httputil.ReverseProxy.
