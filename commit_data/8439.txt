commit 4ffff35abd9562007b0cf4ee8034ded8760e5e2a

    http: Client.Do should follow redirects for GET and HEAD
    
    It's documented as such, but it was never wired up
    after Transport went in and Head was fixed.
    
    If people don't want redirects, that's what RoundTripper/
    Transport are for.  Or a custom redirect policy.
