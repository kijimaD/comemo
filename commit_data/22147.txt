    image/internal/imageutil: new package, used by image/draw and image/jpeg.
    
    The imageutil.DrawYCbCr function lives in an internal package because it
    is needed by both the image/draw and image/jpeg packages, but it doesn't
    seem right for one of those two to depend on the other.
    
    It could eventually go into the image package, but that would require
    committing to an API for the rest of Go 1.x.
