    cmd/compile/internal/ssa: drop overwritten regalloc basic block input requirements
    
    For the following description, consider the following basic block graph:
    
          b1 ───┐┌──── b2
                ││
                ││
                ▼▼
                b3
    
    For register allocator transitions between basic blocks, there are two
    key passes (significant paraphrasing):
    
    First, each basic block is visited in some predetermined visit order.
    This is the core visitOrder range loop in regAllocState.regalloc. The
    specific ordering heuristics aren't important here, except that the
    order guarantees that when visiting a basic block at least one of its
    predecessors has already been visited.
    
    Upon visiting a basic block, that block sets its expected starting
    register state (regAllocState.startRegs) based on the ending register
    state (regAlloc.State.endRegs) of one of its predecessors. (How it
    chooses which predecessor to use is not important here.)
    
    From that starting state, registers are assigned for all values in the
    block, ultimately resulting in some ending register state.
    
    After all blocks have been visited, the shuffle pass
    (regAllocState.shuffle) ensures that for each edge, endRegs of the
    predecessor == startRegs of the successor. That is, it makes sure that
    the startRegs assumptions actually hold true for each edge. It does this
    by adding moves to the end of the predecessor block to place values in
    the expected register for the successor block. These may be moves from
    other registers, or from memory if the value is spilled.
    
    Now on to the actual problem:
    
    Assume that b1 places some value v1 into register R10, and thus ends
    with endRegs containing R10 = v1.
    
    When b3 is visited, it selects b1 as its model predecessor and sets
    startRegs with R10 = v1.
    
    b2 does not have v1 in R10, so later in the shuffle pass, we will add a
    move of v1 into R10 to the end of b2 to ensure it is available for b3.
    
    This is all perfectly fine and exactly how things should work.
    
    Now suppose that b3 does not use v1. It does need to use some other
    value v2, which is not currently in a register. When assigning v2 to a
    register, it finds all registers are already in use and it needs to dump
    a value. Ultimately, it decides to dump v1 from R10 and replace it with
    v2.
    
    This is fine, but it has downstream effects on shuffle in b2. b3's
    startRegs still state that R10 = v1, so b2 will add a move to R10 even
    though b3 will unconditionally overwrite it. i.e., the move at the end
    of b2 is completely useless and can result in code like:
    
    // end of b2
    MOV n(SP), R10 // R10 = v1 <-- useless
    // start of b3
    MOV m(SP), R10 // R10 = v2
    
    This is precisely what happened in #58298.
    
    This CL addresses this problem by dropping registers from startRegs if
    they are never used in the basic block prior to getting dumped. This
    allows the shuffle pass to avoid placing those useless values into the
    register.
    
    There is a significant limitation to this CL, which is that it only
    impacts the immediate predecessors of an overwriting block. We can
    discuss this by zooming out a bit on the previous graph:
    
    b4 ───┐┌──── b5
          ││
          ││
          ▼▼
          b1 ───┐┌──── b2
                ││
                ││
                ▼▼
                b3
    
    Here we have the same graph, except we can see the two predecessors of
    b1.
    
    Now suppose that rather than b1 assigning R10 = v1 as above, the
    assignment is done in b4. b1 has startRegs R10 = v1, doesn't use the
    value at all, and simply passes it through to endRegs R10 = v1.
    
    Now the shuffle pass will require both b2 and b5 to add a move to
    assigned R10 = v1, because that is specified in their successor
    startRegs.
    
    With this CL, b3 drops R10 = v1 from startRegs, but there is no
    backwards propagation, so b1 still has R10 = v1 in startRegs, and b5
    still needs to add a useless move.
    
    Extending this CL with such propagation may significantly increase the
    number of useless moves we can remove, though it will add complexity to
    maintenance and could potentially impact build performance depending on
    how efficiently we could implement the propagation (something I haven't
    considered carefully).
    
    As-is, this optimization does not impact much code. In bent .text size
    geomean is -0.02%. In the container/heap test binary, 18 of ~2500
    functions are impacted by this CL. Bent and sweet do not show a
    noticeable performance impact one way or another, however #58298 does
    show a case where this can have impact if the useless instructions end
    up in the hot path of a tight loop.
    
    For #58298.
