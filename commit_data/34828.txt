    crypto/x509: always emit a critical SAN extension if the Subject is empty.
    
    The RFC is a little ambiguous here: “the subject field contains an empty
    sequence” could mean that it's a non-empty sequence where one of the
    sets contains an empty sequence. But, in context, I think it means “the
    subject field is an empty sequence”.
    
    Fixes #22249
