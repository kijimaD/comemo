    doc: add illegal octal over 255 example
    
    Octal values over 255, like \400 or \777, are illegal.  It wasn't clear if the expected behavior was a compile error, encoding the value as two characters, or if the value would be capped at 255.
    
    This example explicitly shows that octal values over 255 are illegal.
