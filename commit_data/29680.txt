    runtime: make gcDumpObject useful on stack frames
    
    gcDumpObject is often used on a stack pointer (for example, when
    checkmark finds an unmarked object on the stack), but since stack
    spans don't have an elemsize, it doesn't print any of the memory from
    the frame. Make it at least slightly more useful by printing
    everything between obj and obj+off (inclusive). While we're here, also
    print out the span state.
