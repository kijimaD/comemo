    cmd/compile: remove types.Sym.lsym
    
    It was just a cache, and the CL series yesterday
    removed 40% of the calls to types.Linksym in make.bash.
    
    Testing atop CL 40693 (backend concurrency)
    indicates that removing it is actually a very minor
    performance improvement.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
