    os: add TestReadAtOffset
    
    In the Plan 9 kernel, there used to be a bug in the implementation of
    the pread syscall, where the channel offset was erroneously updated after
    calling pread on a file.
    
    This test verifies that ReadAt is behaving as expected.
    
    Fixes #14534.
