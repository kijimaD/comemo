    cmd/go: clarify and simplify (a little) the description of go test's caching
    
    I found the previous text choppy and hard to follow, and in putting
    this CL together, based entirely on the existing text, I found
    several details that seemed misleading to me.
    
    This is my attempt to make the text simultaneously easier to
    understand, more complete, and more precise. I may have failed in
    all three, but I wanted to try.
