    os: deflake TestFdReadRace by increasing timeout
    
    This timeout will never be reached if the test passes, so it doesn't
    much matter how long it is. The test is t.Parallel so on a slow system
    1 second may occasionally not be enough, although on my laptop the
    test takes about 0.02 seconds.
    
    Fixes #34431
