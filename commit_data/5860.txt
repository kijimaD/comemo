            crypto/ocsp: add package to parse OCSP responses.
    
            OCSP is the preferred X.509 revocation mechanism. X.509 certificates
            can contain a URL from which can be fetched a signed response saying
            "this certificate is valid until $x" (where $x is usually 7 days in the
            future). These are called OCSP responses and they can also be included
            in the TLS handshake itself ("OCSP stapling")
