    runtime: remove arbitrary 5-second timeout in TestNeedmDeadlock
    
    The NeedmDeadlock test program currently has a 5-second timeout,
    which is sort of arbitrary. It is long enough in regular mode
    (which usually takes 0.0X seconds), but not quite so for
    configurations like ASAN. Instead of using an arbitrary timeout,
    just use the test's deadline. The test program is invoked with
    testenv.Command, which will send it a SIGQUIT before the deadline
    expires.
    
    Fixes #56420 (at least for the asan builder).
