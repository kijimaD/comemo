    crypto/tls: Use the same buffer size in the client and server in the TLS throughput benchmark
    
    I believe it's necessary to use a buffer size smaller than 64KB because
    (at least some versions of) Window using a TCP receive window less than
    64KB. Currently the client and server use buffer sizes of 16KB and 32KB,
    respectively (the server uses io.Copy, which defaults to 32KB internally).
    Since the server has been using 32KB, it should be safe for the client to
    do so as well.
    
    Fixes #15899
