    runtime: clarify access to mheap_.busy
    
    There are two accesses to mheap_.busy that are guarded by checks
    against len(mheap_.free). This works because both lists are (and must
    be) the same length, but it makes the code less clear. Change these to
    use len(mheap_.busy) so the access more clearly parallels the check.
    
    Fixes #18944.
