    ld/macho: add all missing load commands
    
    The ld/macho code currently understands a subset of the mach-o load
    commands. I've encountered one of these in the wild in a Go-produced
    binary, which tripped up the Go linker because its switch statement
    expects its list of load commands to be exhaustive; the rest I've
    added for the sake of completion.
    
    The ruby-macho library is a good non-Darwin header resource for these:

    Fixes #25908
