    cmd/compile: get rid of unnecessary inline marks
    
    If no other instruction mentions an inline mark, we can get rid of it.
    This normally happens when the inlined function is empty, or when all
    of its code is folded into other instructions.
    
    Also use consistent statement-ness for inline mark positions, so that
    more of them can be removed in favor of existing instructions.
    
    Update #29571
    Fixes #31172
