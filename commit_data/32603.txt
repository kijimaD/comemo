    go/types: remove invalid documentation and assertion on package names
    
    NewPackage required through documentation that the package name not
    be blank (which wasn't true since each time we check a new package
    we create one with a blank name (api.go:350). NewPackage also asserted
    that a package name not be "_". While it is invalid for a package name
    to be "_", one could conceivably create a package named "_" through
    export data manipulation. Furthermore, it is ok to import a package
    with package path "_" as long as the package itself is not named "_".
    
    - removed misleading documentation
    - removed unnecessary assertion
    - added safety checks when we actually do the import
    
    Fixes #20231.
