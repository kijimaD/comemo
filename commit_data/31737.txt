    cmd/internal/obj/arm: don't split instructions on NaCl
    
    We insert guard instructions after each "dangerous" instruction
    to make NaCl's validator happy. This happens before asmout. If
    in asmout an instruction is split to two dangerous instructions,
    but only one guard instruction is inserted, the validation fails.
    Therefore don't split instructions on NaCl.
    
    Fixes #20595.
