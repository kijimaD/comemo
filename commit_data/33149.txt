    cmd/cover: don't try to attach directives to synthetic decls
    
    Fixed an error that occurred in atomic mode. cover adds a global
    variable declaration that forces sync/atomic to be used. fixDirectives
    was confused by this declaration since it has an invalid
    position. These declarations are now skipped.
    
    Fixes #22309
