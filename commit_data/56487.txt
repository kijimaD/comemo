    runtime: rename getcallerfp to getfp
    
    The previous name was wrong due to the mistaken assumption that calling
    f->g->getcallerpc and f->g->getcallersp would respectively return the
    pc/sp at g. However, they are actually referring to their caller's
    caller, i.e. f.
    
    Rename getcallerfp to getfp in order to stay consistent with this
    naming convention.
    
    Also see discussion on CL 463835.
    
    For #16638
