    [dev.cc] runtime: allow more address bits in lfstack on Power64
    
    Previously, lfstack assumed Linux limited user space addresses
    to 43 bits on Power64 based on a paper from 2001.  It turns
    out the limit is now 46 bits, so lfstack was truncating
    pointers.
    
    Raise the limit to 48 bits (for some future proofing and to
    make it match amd64) and add a self-test that will fail in a
    useful way if ever unpack(pack(x)) != x.
    
    With this change, dev.cc passes all.bash on power64le.
