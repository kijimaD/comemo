    [dev.link] cmd/link: fix pclntab symbol handling on AIX
    
    On AIX, container symbols are handled in a weird way (unlike
    other platforms): the outer symbol needs to have size (but still
    no data), and the inner symbols must not be in the symbol table
    (otherwise it overlaps with the outer symbol, which the system
    linker doesn't like).
    
    As of CL 241598, pclntab becomes a container symbol. We need to
    follow the rule above for AIX.
    
    Fix AIX build.
