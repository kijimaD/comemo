commit 967901a396eb702497e1e1dbaf64987744a92a45
Author: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>

    doc: update links in contribute.html
    
    CLA links are now redirects. Use new URLs instead.
    
    Also, use https:// links for all Google sites where
    the http version just redirects to https anyway.
    (That's all links on the page, as it turns out)
