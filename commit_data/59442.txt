    Revert "net/url: consider an empty base Path as equivalent to / in JoinPath"
    
    This reverts commit a46285f8c2389b92952c1484daacfccf70a17047 (CL 469935).
    
    Reason for revert: This breaks a variety of code inside Google
    that seem representative of possible external real-world usage.
    
    If we roll this forward again we should include a GODEBUG like
    urljoinpathslash=0 to go back to the old behavior.
