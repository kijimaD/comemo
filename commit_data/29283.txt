    Revert of cmd/compile: ignore contentEscapes for marking nodes as escaping
    
    Reason for revert: broke the build due to cherrypick;
    relies on an unsubmitted parent CL.
    
    Original issue's description:
    > cmd/compile: ignore contentEscapes for marking nodes as escaping
    >
    > We can still stack allocate and VarKill nodes which don't
    > escape but their content does.
    >
    > Fixes #16996
