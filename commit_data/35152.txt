commit 43bf63fce1abad1d5fe673e2c869e4d32f62885e
Author: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 3 11:27:26 2018 -0800

    cmd/go, testing: test names don't have to be alphanumeric
    
    In func TestXxxx(*testing.T) the Xxxx can be anything that can appear
    in an identifier, but can't start with a lowercase letter. Clarify the docs.
    
    Fixes #23322
