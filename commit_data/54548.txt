    net/http: deflake TestCancelRequestWhenSharingConnection
    
    The test sleeps for 1 millisecond to give the cancellation a moment
    to take effect. This is flaky because the request can finish before
    the cancellation of the context is seen. It's easy to verify by adding
    
        time.Sleep(2*time.Millisecond)
    
    after https://github.com/golang/go/blob/0a6c4c87404ecb018faf002919e5d5db04c69ee2/src/net/http/transport.go#L2619.
    With this modification, the test fails about 5 times out of 10 runs.
    
    The fix is easy. We just need to block the handler of the second
    request until this request is cancelled. I have verify that the
    updated test can uncover the issue fixed by CL 257818.
    
    Fixes #55226.
