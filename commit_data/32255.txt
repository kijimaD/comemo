    archive/tar: roundtrip reading device numbers
    
    Both GNU and BSD tar do not care if the devmajor and devminor values are
    set on entries (like regular files) that aren't character or block devices.
    
    While this is non-sensible, it is more consistent with the Writer to actually
    read these fields always. In a vast majority of the cases these will still
    be zero. In the rare situation where someone actually cares about these,
    at least information was not silently lost.
