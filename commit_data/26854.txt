    src: split nacltest.bash into naclmake.bash and keep nacltest.bash
    
    Needed by the build system to shard tests. nacl was the last unsharded
    builder.
    
    (I considered also adding a -make-only flag to nacltest.bash, but that
    wouldn't fail fast when the file didn't exist.)
    
    Updates #15242
