    cmd/compile: fix regression in DWARF inlined routine variable tracking
    
    Fix a bug in the code that generates the pre-inlined variable
    declaration table used as raw material for emitting DWARF inline
    routine records. The fix for issue 23704 altered the recipe for
    assigning file/line/col to variables in one part of the compiler, but
    didn't update a similar recipe in the code for variable tracking.
    Added a new test that should catch problems of a similar nature.
    
    Fixes #24460.
