    cmd/compile: refine statement marking in numberlines
    
    1) An empty block is treated as not-a-statement unless its line differs
    from at least one of its predecessors (it might make sense to
    rearrange branches in predecessors, but that is a different issue).
    
    2) When iterating forward to choose a "good" place for a statement,
    actually check that the chosen place is in fact good.
    
    3) Refactor same line and same file into methods on XPos and Pos.
    
    This reduces the failure rate of ssa/stmtlines_test by 7-ish lines.
    (And interacts favorably with later debugging CLs.)
