    Revert "testing: only compute b.N once when passed -count > 1"
    
    This reverts golang.org/cl/110775
    
    Reason for revert: this is causing huge slow-dows on every run after
    the 1st, on various benchmarks, on multiple architectures (see Issue
    25622 for details). It's just a nice-to-have little optimization, and
    we're near the 1st go1.11 beta release, so I'm reverting it.
    
    Fixes #25622
