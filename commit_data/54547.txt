    SECURITY.md: update the Reporting a Vulnerability link
    
    The https://go.dev/security is about: "This page provides
    resources for Go developers to improve security for their
    projects.", https://go.dev/security/policy is about Go Security Policy.
    
    go.dev/security links to go.dev/security/policy,
    but I think it is better to link directly to go.dev/security/policy
    in this case.
