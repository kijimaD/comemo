    xml: handle tag paths through the same element
    
    With the current implementation, xml unmarshalling
    will silently fail to unmarshal any paths passing
    through the same element, such as:
    
    type T struct {
            A string "dummy>a"
            B string "dummy>b"
    }
    
    This change tweaks the algorithm so that this works
    correctly.
    
    Also, using paths that would cause the same element to
    unmarshal twice will error out ahead of time explaining
    the problem, rather than silently misbehaving.
