    dashboard: add gobuilder -fail mode
    
    This is for filling a column with "fail", like I just did for
    Windows, when the builder would get stuck running that
    build.  (We have safeguards against the tests getting stuck
    but this was the bootstrap build getting stuck.)
    
    I usually use -cmd=/bin/false, but this avoids the Mercurial
    checkouts, which means it runs instantly instead of requiring
    ~1 minute per "fail".
