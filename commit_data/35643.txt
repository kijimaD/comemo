    net/http: add application/wasm mime type
    
    Although not part of http://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org,
    for WASM streaming compilation to happen, the response
    needs to have the application/wasm MIME type
    as mentioned here:
    https://webassembly.github.io/spec/web-api/index.html#streaming-modules.
    
    And all current browsers prevent streaming compilation
    from happening if this MIME type is not present in the response.
    
    The magic number is mentioned here:
    https://webassembly.org/docs/binary-encoding
    
    Since we are already adding WASM support, it makes sense
    to support this MIME type.
