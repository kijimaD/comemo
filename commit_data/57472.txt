    os: define TestIssue60181 only on Unix platforms
    
    In CL 517755 the test was added in the unconstrained os_test.go
    because it appeared to be portable, but it turned out not to be
    valid on plan9.
    
    (The build error was masked on the misc-compile TryBots by #61923.)
    
    Although the test can also compile and run on Windows, the bug it
    checks for is specific to Linux and only really needs to run there, so
    I am moving it to os_unix_test.go instead of adding yet another test
    file for “Unix and Windows but not Plan 9”.
    
    Updates #60181.
