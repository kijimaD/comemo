    misc/ios: evaluate symlinks before comparing GOROOT and GOPATH
    
    CL 163726 added workarounds to keep the iOS builders happy in
    a symlinked temporary dir.
    
    The workarounds also made the tests more realistic and improved
    performance. Keep them but also handle symlinks better in the
    exec wrapper.
