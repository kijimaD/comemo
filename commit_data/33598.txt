    cmd/go: run cover before cgo
    
    If we're running coverage on a package using cgo, we need to
    apply both cmd/cover and cmd/cgo as source transformers.
    To date we've applied cgo, then cover.
    
    Cover is very sensitive to the exact character position of
    expressions in its input, though, and cgo is not, so swap
    them, applying first cover and then cgo.
    
    The only drawback here is that coverage formerly applied
    to SWIG-generated cgo files, and now it does not.
    I am not convinced anyone depended critically on that,
    and probably the later analysis with go tool cover would
    have tried to parse the original .swig file as a Go file and
    gotten very confused.
    
    Fixes #8726.
    Fixes #9212.
    Fixes #9479.
