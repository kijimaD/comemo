commit 9dfc6f6427b4b44d5684dad1ae5cea45a82821ee

    go_spec.html: clarify rune and string literals
    No changes to the meaning, just clearer language and more
    examples, including illegal rune and string literals.
    In particular, "character literal" and "character constant"
    are now called "rune literal" and "rune constant" and the
    word "character" always refers to the source text, not
    program values.
