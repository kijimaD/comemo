    cmd/go, testing: remove redundant "for pkg" in coverage message
    
    This is a transcript before this change. I've capitalized the text being removed.
    Note that it is always near another line that already says fmt, marked with <<<
    
    $ cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/fmt
    
    $ go test -cover
    PASS
    coverage FOR FMT: 91.3% of statements
    ok      fmt     0.040s <<<
    
    $ go test -coverpkg strconv
    PASS
    coverage FOR FMT: 64.9% of statements in strconv
    ok      fmt     0.039s <<<
    
    $ go test -cover -c
    $ ./fmt.test -test.covermode=set <<<
    PASS
    coverage FOR FMT: 91.3% of statements
    
    $ go test -coverpkg strconv -c
    $ ./fmt.test -test.covermode=set <<<
    PASS
    coverage FOR FMT: 64.9% of statements in strconv
    
    That the summary printed by 'go test [options] fmt' is unchanged:
    
    $ go test -cover fmt
    ok      fmt     0.040s  coverage: 91.3% of statements
    
    $ go test -coverpkg strconv fmt
    ok      fmt     0.038s  coverage: 64.9% of statements in strconv
