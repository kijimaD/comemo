    cmd/doc: fix pretty printing of paths
    
    The code to strip GOROOT and GOPATH had a bug: it assumed there
    were bytes after the GOROOT prefix but there might not be.
    Fix this and other issues by taking care the prefix is really a
    file name prefix for the path, not just a string prefix, and
    handle the case where GOROOT==path.
