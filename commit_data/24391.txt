    runtime: disallow GC assists in non-preemptible contexts
    
    Currently it's possible to perform GC work on a system stack or when
    locks are held if there's an allocation that triggers an assist. This
    is generally a bad idea because of the fragility of these contexts,
    and it's incompatible with two changes we're about to make: one is to
    yield after signaling mark completion (which we can't do from a
    non-preemptible context) and the other is to make assists block if
    there's no other way for them to pay off the assist debt.
    
    This commit simply skips the assist if it's called from a
    non-preemptible context. The allocation will still count toward the
    assist debt, so it will be paid off by a later assist. There should be
    little allocation from non-preemptible contexts, so this shouldn't
    harm the overall assist mechanism.
