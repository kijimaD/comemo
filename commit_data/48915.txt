    go/types: in TestStdlib, import from source instead of export data
    
    TestStdlib was failing after running
            rm -r $(go env GOROOT)/pkg/*/cmd
    as the builders do when building binary releases.¹
    
    For users who write programs that depend on go/types, it should be
    reasonable to run the tests for go/types as part of 'go test all', and
    those tests should pass even if they installed Go from a binary
    release.
    
    I had originally drafted this as a fallback to import from source only
    if the affected packages can't be imported by the default export-data
    importer. Unfortunately, I realized that we don't currently have a
    builder that tests the actual release (#46900), so it is quite likely
    that the fallback path would bit-rot and produce unexpected test
    regressions.
    
    So instead, we now unconditionally import from source in TestStdlib.
    That makes the test substantially slower (~15s instead of ~5s on my
    workstation), but with less risk of regression, and TestStdlib is
    skipped in short mode already so short-mode test time is unaffected.
    
    If we change the builders to test the actual release configuration, we
    can consider restoring the faster path when export data is available.
