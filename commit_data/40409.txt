    cmd/compile: re-use regalloc's []valState
    
    Updates #27739: reduces package ssa's allocated space by 3.77%.
    
    maxrss is harder to measure, but using best-of-three-runs
    as reported by /usr/bin/time -l, I see ~2% reduction in maxrss.
    
    We still have a long way to go, though; the new maxrss is still 1.1gb.
