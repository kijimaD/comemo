    runtime: adjust TestPhysicalMemoryUtilization to handle large page sizes
    
    Currently TestPhysicalMemoryUtilization can fail on systems with large
    physical page sizes like 64 KiB because all the of the holes to be
    scavenged are not aligned to the page size. The holes themselves are 64
    KiB so this is actually quite likely.
    
    Bump the size of the allocations for systems with larger physical page
    sizes, and add additional slack to the threshold for unaligned pieces of
    the holes that may be unaligned.
    
    Fixes #49411.
