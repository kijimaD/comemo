    runtime: flush write barrier buffer to create work
    
    Currently, if the gcWork runs out of work, we'll fall out of the GC
    worker, even though flushing the write barrier buffer could produce
    more work. While this is not a correctness issue, it can lead to
    premature mark 2 or mark termination.
    
    Fix this by flushing the write barrier buffer if the local gcWork runs
    out of work and then checking the local gcWork again.
    
    This reduces the number of premature mark terminations during all.bash
    by about a factor of 10.
    
    Updates #26903. This is preparation for eliminating mark 2.
