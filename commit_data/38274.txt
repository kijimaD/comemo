    encoding/json: fix "data changed underfoot?" panic
    
    Given a program as follows:
    
            data := []byte(`{"F": {
                    "a": 2,
                    "3": 4
            }}`)
            json.Unmarshal(data, &map[string]map[int]int{})
    
    The JSON package should error, as "a" is not a valid integer. However,
    we'd encounter a panic:
    
            panic: JSON decoder out of sync - data changing underfoot?
    
    The reason was that decodeState.object would return a nil error on
    encountering the invalid map key string, while saving the key type error
    for later. This broke if we were inside another object, as we would
    abruptly end parsing the nested object, leaving the decoder in an
    unexpected state.
    
    To fix this, simply avoid storing the map element and continue decoding
    the object, to leave the decoder state exactly as if we hadn't seen an
    invalid key type.
    
    This affected both signed and unsigned integer keys, so fix both and add
    two test cases.
    
    Updates #28189.
