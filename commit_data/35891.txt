    internal/trace: fix GC time computation of short goroutines
    
    Goroutine analysis reports the sum of all overlapping GC intervals as
    the GCTime of a goroutine. The computation is done by adding the length
    of a completed GC interval to 'active' goroutines when processing the
    corresponding EvGCDone event. This change fixes the two corner cases
    the current implementation ignores:
    
    1) Goroutine that ends during GC. Previously, this goroutine was ignored
    and GC time was undercounted. We handle this case by setting the
    gcStartTime only when GC is active and handling non-zero gcStartTime
    when processing EvGoStop and EvGoStart.
    
    2) Goroutine that starts during GC. Previously, the entire GC interval
    length was added to the Goroutine's GCTime which resulted in overcount
    of GC time. We handle this case by computing the length of overlapped
    period precisely.
