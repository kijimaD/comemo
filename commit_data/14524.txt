commit 25dd00295c54fa23a545bfdd27824ac403ceba84
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>

    spec: clarify use of built-ins in go/defer statements
    
    1) Built-ins are restricted like for expression statements.
       This documents the status quo.
    
    2) Calls cannot be parenthesized. The spec is not clear. gccgo
       permits it already, gc doesn't. Be explicit in the spec.
    
     Fixes #4462.
