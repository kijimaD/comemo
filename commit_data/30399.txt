    cmd/compile: added cheapexpr call to simplify operand of CONVIFACE
    
    New special case for booleans and byte-sized integer types
    converted to interfaces needs to ensure that the operand is
    not too complex, if it were to appear in a parameter list
    for example.
    
    Added test, also increased the recursive node dump depth to
    a level that was actually useful for an actual bug.
    
    Fixes #19275.
