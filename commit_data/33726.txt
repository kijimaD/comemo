    compress/flate: remove non-standard extensions to flate
    
    Some constants were added to flate that seem to be an experimental
    attempt at increasing the window size. However, according to RFC1951,
    the largest window size is 32KiB, so these constants are non-standard.
    Delete them.
    
    Fixes #18458
