    io/ioutil: provide an equivalent for the deprecated ReadDir
    
    All APIs in the now-deprecated io/ioutil package have a direct
    replacement in either the io or os package with the same signature,
    with the notable exception of ioutil.ReadDir, as os.ReadDir has a
    slightly different signature with fs.DirEntry rather than fs.FileInfo.
    
    New code can easily make use of []fs.DirEntry directly,
    but existing code may need to continue using []fs.FileInfo for backwards
    compatibility reasons. For instance, I had a bit of code that exposed
    the slice as a public API, like:
    
            return ioutil.ReadDir(name)
    
    It took me a couple of minutes to figure out what the exact equivalent
    in terms of os.ReadDir would be, and a code sample would have helped.
    Add one for future reference.
    
    For #42026.
    For #51927.
