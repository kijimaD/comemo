    sync: give finalizers more time in TestPoolGC
    
    If we report a leak, make sure we've waited long enough to be sure.
    The new sleep regimen waits 1.05 seconds before failing; the old
    one waited 0.005 seconds.
    
    (The single linux/amd64 failure in this test feels more like a
    timing problem than a leak. I don't want to spend time on it unless
    we're sure.)
