    cmd/dist: add doc file to fix go doc dist
    
    $ go tool -h says:
    
      For more about each tool command, see 'go tool command -h'.
    
    but it was suggested to change the suggestion to say:
    
      see 'go doc command'
    
    In #18313.
    
    That would work for every tool except dist, which has no doc.go.
    
    This change adds a doc.go file to cmd/dist.
    
    Updates #18313
