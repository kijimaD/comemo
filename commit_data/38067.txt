    cmd/compile: treat slice pointers as non-nil
    
    var a []int = ...
    p := &a[0]
    _ = *p
    
    We don't need to nil check on the 3rd line. If the bounds check on the 2nd
    line passes, we know p is non-nil.
    
    We rely on the fact that any cap>0 slice has a non-nil pointer as its
    pointer to the backing array. This is true for all safely-constructed slices,
    and I don't see any reason why someone would violate this rule using unsafe.

    Fixes #30366
