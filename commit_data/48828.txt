    [dev.typeparams] cmd/compile: skip types2 GC test during bootstrapping
    
    Unified includes a check to make sure that types2 memory has been
    garbage collected, but it relies on precise finalization, which we
    provide (for dynamically allocated objects, at least) but isn't
    guaranteed by the Go spec. In particular, Go 1.4 doesn't provide this.
    
    The check is strictly unnecessary and only exists to make sure we
    don't regress and start holding onto types2 memory accidentally. So
    just disable the check during bootstrap builds.
