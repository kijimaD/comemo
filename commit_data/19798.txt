    cmd/ld: mark hostobj sections as containing no pointers
    Currently they are scanned conservatively.
    But there is no reason to scan them. C world must not contain
    pointers into Go heap. Moreover, we don't have enough information
    to emit write barriers nor update pointers there in future.
    The immediate need is that it breaks the new GC because
    these are weird symbols as if with pointers but not necessary
    pointer aligned.
