    runtime: clean up funcID assignment
    
    Large enum sets should be sorted by name when the
    values don't matter, as they don't here. Do that.
    
    Also replace the large switch with a map lookup.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
