    net: fix LookupCNAME on Plan 9
    
    In CL 34650, LookupCNAME was changed so it always returns
    the canonical DNS host, even when there is no CNAME record.
    
    Consequently, TestLookupCNAME was failing on Plan 9,
    because www.google.com doesn't have a CNAME record.
    
    We changed the implementation of lookupCNAME on Plan 9, so it
    returns the canonical DNS host after a CNAME lookup failure.
    
    Fixes #18391.
