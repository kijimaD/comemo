 Godoc treats executable commands somewhat differently. Instead of inspecting the
 command source code, it looks for a Go source file belonging to the special
-package "documentation”. The comment on the "package documentation” clause is
+package "documentation". The comment on the "package documentation" clause is
 used as the command's documentation. For example, see the
 <a href="/cmd/godoc/">godoc documentation</a> and its corresponding
 <a href="/src/cmd/godoc/doc.go">doc.go</a> file.
