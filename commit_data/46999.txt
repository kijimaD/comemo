    runtime/pprof: expect tests to pass on macOS
    
    macOS tests have been disabled since CL 12429045 (Aug 2013).
    At the time, macOS required a kernel patch to get a working profiler
    (https://research.swtch.com/macpprof), which we didn't want
    to require, of course.
    
    macOS has improved - it no longer requires the kernel patch - but
    we never updated the list of exceptions.
    
    As far as I can tell, the builders have no problem passing the pprof test now.
    (It is possible that the iOS builders have trouble, but that is now a different GOOS.)
    
    Remove the exception for macOS. The test should now pass.
    
    Fixes #6047.
