    test/nosplit: apply stack limit adjustment in the right place
    
    The nosplit test was originally written when the stack limit was a
    mere 128 bytes. Now it's much larger, but rather than rewriting all of
    the tests, we apply a hack to just add the extra space into the stack
    frames of the existing tests.
    
    Unfortunately, we add it in the wrong place. The extra space should be
    added just once per chain of nosplit functions, but instead we add it
    to every frame that appears first on a line in the test's little
    script language. This means that for tests like
    
        start 0 call f1
        f1 16 nosplit call f2
        f2 16 nosplit call f3
        f3 16 nosplit call f4
        f4 16 nosplit call f5
        f5 16 nosplit call f6
        f6 16 nosplit call f7
        f7 16 nosplit call f8
        f8 16 nosplit call end
        end 1000
        REJECT
    
    we add 672 bytes to *every* frame, meaning that we wind up way over
    the stack limit by the end of the stanza, rather than just a little as
    originally intended.
    
    Fix this by instead adding the extra space to the first nosplit
    function in a stanza. This isn't perfect either, since we could have a
    nosplit -> split -> nosplit chain, but it's the best we can do without
    a graph analysis.
