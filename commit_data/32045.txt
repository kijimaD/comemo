    runtime: track forced GCs independent of gcMode
    
    Currently gcMode != gcBackgroundMode implies this was a user-forced GC
    cycle. This is no longer going to be true when we make runtime.GC()
    trigger a concurrent GC, so replace this with an explicit
    work.userForced bit.
    
    For #18216.
