    go/types: factor out usage of implicit type
    
    There was some duplication of logic interpreting the implicit type of
    an operand in assignableTo and convertUntyped. Factor out this logic to
    a new 'implicitType' function, which returns the implicit type of an
    untyped operand when used in a context where a target type is expected.
    I believe this resolves some comments about code duplication. There is
    other similar code in assignable, assignableTo, and convertUntypes, but
    I found it to to be sufficiently semantically distinct to not warrant
    factoring out.
