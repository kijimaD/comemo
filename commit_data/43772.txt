    cmd/compile: fix misalignment in sources column of generated ssa.html
    
    Fix regression where line numbers in the sources column of generated
    ssa.html output became misaligned with the source code. This was due
    to some new margins applied to certain h2 elements during the work
    to combine identical columns.
    
    Fixes #38612
