    crypto/tls: fix bogo IgnoreClientVersionOrder skip reason
    
    The BoGo IgnoreClientVersionOrder test checks that a client that sends
    a supported_versions extension with the list [TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3] ends up
    negotiating TLS 1.3.
    
    However, the crypto/tls module treats this list as being in client
    preference order, and so negotiates TLS 1.2, failing the test.
    
    Our behaviour appears to be the correct handling based on RFC 8446
    ยง4.2.1 where it says:
      The extension contains a list of supported versions in preference
      order, with the most preferred version first.
    
    This commit updates the reason we skip this test to cite the RFC instead
    of saying it's something to be fixed.
    
    Updates #72006
