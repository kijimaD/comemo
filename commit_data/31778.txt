    runtime: YIELD in procyield on ARM
    
    ARM currently does not use a hardware yield instruction in the spin
    loop in procyield because the YIELD instruction was only added in
    ARMv6K. However, it appears earlier ARM chips will interpret the YIELD
    encoding as an effective NOP (specifically an MSR instruction that
    ultimately has no effect on the CPSR register).
    
    Hence, use YIELD in procyield on ARM since it should be, at worst,
    harmless.
    
    Fixes #16663.
