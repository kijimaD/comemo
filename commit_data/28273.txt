    image/draw: optimize drawFillOver as drawFillSrc for opaque fills.
    
    Benchmarks are much better for opaque fills and slightly worse on non
    opaque fills. I think that on balance, this is still a win.
    
    When the source is uniform(color.RGBA{0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0xff}):
    name        old time/op  new time/op  delta
    FillOver-8   966µs ± 1%    32µs ± 1%  -96.67%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)
    FillSrc-8   32.4µs ± 1%  32.2µs ± 1%     ~      (p=0.053 n=9+10)
