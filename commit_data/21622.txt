    [dev.cc] cmd/dist: build new5a etc during bootstrap
    
    The change to the bootstrap import conversion is
    for the a.y files, which use import dot.
    
    While we're editing the tool list, add "cmd/dist".
    Right now 'go install cmd/dist' installs to $GOROOT/bin/dist.
    (A new bug since cmd/dist has been rewritten in Go.
    When cmd/dist was a C program, go install cmd/dist just didn't work.)
