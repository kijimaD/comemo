    cmd/compile: ensure necessary types appear in .debug_info
    
    Autotmp filtering was too aggressive and excluded types
    necessary to make debuggers work properly.  Restore the
    "late filter" in dwarf.go based on names to exclude autotmps,
    and remove the "early filter" in pgen.go based on how the
    name was introduced.  However, the updated naming scheme
    with a dot prefix is retained to prevent accidental clashes
    with legal Go identifier names.
    
    Includes test (grouped with runtime gdb tests),
    verified to fail without the fix.
    
    Updates #17644.
    Fixes #17830.
