    net/http: do not send redundant Connection: close header in HTTP/1.0 responses
    
    HTTP/1.0 connections are closed implicitly, unless otherwise specified.
    
    Note that this change does not test or fix "request too large" responses.
    Reasoning: (a) it complicates tests and fixes, (b) they should be rare,
    and (c) this is just a minor wire optimization, and thus not really worth worrying
    about in this context.
    
    Fixes #5955.
