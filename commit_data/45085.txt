    runtime: non-strict InlTreeIndex lookup in expandFinalInlineFrame
    
    This is a follow-up to golang.org/cl/301369, which made the same change
    in Frames.Next. The same logic applies here: a profile stack may have
    been truncated at an invalid PC provided by cgoTraceback.
    expandFinalInlineFrame will then try to lookup the inline tree and
    crash.
    
    The same fix applies as well: upon encountering a bad PC, simply leave
    it as-is and move on.
    
    Fixes #44971
    Fixes #45480
