    cmd/go: sometimes name tmp test binary test.test.exe on Windows
    
    Right now it is always pkgname.test.exe, but if pkgname is
    patch or install or setup or update, Windows thinks that
    running it will install new software, so it pops up a dialog
    box asking for more permission.
    Renaming the binary avoids the Windows security check.
    
    This only applies to the binary that the Go command writes
    to its temporary work directory. If the user runs 'go test -c'
    or any of the other ways to generate a test binary, it will
    continue to use pkgname.test.exe.
    
    Fixes #8711.
