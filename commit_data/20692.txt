    cmd/ld: do not assume that only pe section names start with '.'
    
    Our current pe object reader assumes that every symbol starting with
    '.' is section. It appeared to be true, until now gcc 4.9.1 generates
    some symbols with '.' at the front. Change that logic to check other
    symbol fields in addition to checking for '.'. I am not an expert
    here, but it seems reasonable to me.
    
    Added test, but it is only good, if tested with gcc 4.9.1. Otherwise
    the test PASSes regardless.
    
    Fixes #8811.
    Fixes #8856.
