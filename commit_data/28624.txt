    context: document how to release resources associated with Contexts.
    
    Some users don't realize that creating a Context with a CancelFunc
    attaches a subtree to the parent, and that that subtree is not released
    until the CancelFunc is called or the parent is canceled.  Make this
    clear early in the package docs, so that people learning about this
    package have the right conceptual model.
