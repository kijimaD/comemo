    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: fix potential closure waste in Order
    
    I haven't measured this, but it's the only use of EditChildren
    where we aren't careful to allocate a closure once and use it
    for the whole recursion. This one is allocating a closure at
    every level of the recursion, and it was an oversight that it
    wasn't cleaned up in the original CL.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
