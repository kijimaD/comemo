    crypto/tls: restore OCSP and SCTs during session resumption
    
    Restore previously sent SCTs and stapled OCSP response during session
    resumption for both TLS 1.2 and 1.3. This behavior is somewhat
    complicated for TLS 1.2 as SCTs are sent during the server hello,
    so they override what is saved in ClientSessionState. It is likely
    that if the server is sending a different set of SCTs there is probably
    a reason for doing so, such as a log being retired, or SCT validation
    requirements changing, so it makes sense to defer to the server in
    that case.
    
    Fixes #39075
