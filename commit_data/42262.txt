    cmd/dist: remove redundant 'go test -race' call
    
    In CL 207962, I removed a seemingly-redundant -i flag. As it turns
    out, the -i flag has *two* meanings: “install dependencies”, and “do
    not actually run the test”. Without the flag, we omit the former
    behavior, but add the latter.
    
    We're about to run specific tests from these binaries on the very next
    line, so don't preemptively run all of the tests.
    
    Updates #30316
