    runtime: eliminate blocking GC work drains
    
    Now work.helperDrainBlock is always false, so we can remove it and
    code paths that only ran when it was true. That means we no longer use
    the gcDrainBlock mode of gcDrain, so we can eliminate that. That means
    we no longer use gcWork.get, so we can eliminate that. That means we
    no longer use getfull, so we can eliminate that.
    
    Updates #26903. This is a follow-up to unifying STW GC and concurrent GC.
