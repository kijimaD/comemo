    misc/ios: keep whole buffer in go_darwin_arm_exec
    
    The existing go_darwin_arm_exec.go script does not work with Xcode 7,
    not due to any significant changes, but just ordering and timing of
    statements from lldb. Unfortunately the current design of
    go_darwin_arm_exec.go makes it not obvious what gets stuck where, so
    this moves from a moving buffer window to a complete buffer of the
    lldb output.
    
    The result is easier code to follow, and it works with Xcode 7.
    
    Updates #12660.
