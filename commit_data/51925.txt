    cmd/compile: clarify help message for -L flag
    
    The file names reported in error messages by the compiler are
    printed unchanged from the file names provided to the compiler;
    the -L flag has no impact on the file names themselves, contrary
    to what the old flag description suggested.
    
    If an error is reported on a line that is affected by a //line
    directive, an error message reports the file name and line as
    controlled by the directive (i.e., the actual source position
    is not known).
    
    If the -L flag is provided, the actual source position is also
    reported in square brackets.
    
    This change documents this with an updated help string for the
    flag.
    
    For #36988.
