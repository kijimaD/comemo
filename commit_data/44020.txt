    test: adjust issue11371 to fit in required precision
    
    The language spec only requires that floating point values be
    represented with 256 bits, which is about 1e75. The issue11371 test
    was assuming that the compiler could represent 1e100. Adjusting the
    test so that it only assumes 256 bits of precision still keeps the
    test valid, and permits it to pass when using the gofrontend.
