    weak: clarify Pointer equality semantics
    
    The docs currently are imprecise about comparisons. This could lead
    users to believe that objects of the same type, allocated at the same
    address, could produce weak pointers that are equal to
    previously-created weak pointers. This is not the case. Weak pointers
    map to objects, not addresses.
    
    Update the documentation to state precisely that if two pointers do not
    compare equal, then two weak pointers created from those two pointers
    are guaranteed not to compare equal. Since a future pointer pointing to
    the same address is not comparable with a pointer produced *before* an
    object at that address has been reclaimed, this is sufficient to explain
    that weak pointers map 1:1 with object offsets, not addresses.
    
    (An object slot cannot be reused unless that slot is unreachable, so
    by construction, there's never an opportunity to compare an "old" and
    "new" pointer unless one uses unsafe tricks that violate the
    unsafe.Pointer rules.)
    
    Fixes #71381.
