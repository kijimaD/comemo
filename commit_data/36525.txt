    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: add more atomic instructions
    
    More atomic instructions were introduced in ARMv8.1. And this CL
    adds support for them and corresponding test cases.
    
    LDADD Rs, (Rb), Rt: (Rb) -> Rt, Rs+(Rb) -> (Rb)
    LDAND Rs, (Rb), Rt: (Rb) -> Rt, Rs&(Rb) -> (Rb)
    LDEOR Rs, (Rb), Rt: (Rb) -> Rt, Rs^(Rb) -> (Rb)
    LDOR  Rs, (Rb), Rt: (Rb) -> Rt, Rs|(Rb) -> (Rb)
