    testing: treat PAUSE lines as changing the active test name
    
    We could instead fix cmd/test2json to treat PAUSE lines as *not*
    changing the active test name, but that seems like it would be more
    confusing to humans, and also wouldn't fix tools that parse output
    using existing builds of cmd/test2json.
    
    Fixes #40657
