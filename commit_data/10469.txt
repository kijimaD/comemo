    exp/ssh: alter Session to match the exec.Cmd API
    
    This CL inverts the direction of the Stdin/out/err members of the
    Session struct so they reflect the API of the exec.Cmd. In doing so
    it borrows heavily from the exec package.
    
    Additionally Shell now returns immediately, wait for completion using
    Wait. Exec calls Wait internally and so blocks until the remote
    command is complete.
    
    Credit to Gustavo Niemeyer for the impetus for this CL.
