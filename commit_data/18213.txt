    liblink: adjust format verbs to avoid collisions
    
    The %S and %N format verbs are used by cmd/gc to
    represent Sym and Node structures, respectively.
    
    In liblink, these two verbs are used only by the %D
    format routine and never referenced externally.
    
    This change will allow us to delete the duplicated
    code for the %A, %D, %P, and %R format routines in
    both the compiler and linker.
