    go spec: Base comparison compatibility on assignment compatibility.
    
    Specifically:
    - Simplified definition of comparison compatibility and folded into
      section on comparison operators since it's only used there.
    
    This is a small language change/cleanup. As a consequence:
    - An interface value may now be compared against a non-interface value.
    - Channels with opposite directions cannot be compared directly anymore
      (per discussion with rsc).
