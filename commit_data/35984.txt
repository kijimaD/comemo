    cmd/link: eliminate a couple of unused DWARF attrs
    
    The linker's DWARF generation occasionally computes and attaches an
    attribute X to a type even though the type's abbrev doesn't have the
    specified attr. For example, the DW_TAG_subroutine_type abbrev entry
    has no type attribute, but a type attr is given to it (wasting
    memory). Similarly there are some places where a byte size attr is
    added to a DIE whose abbrev lacks that attr. This patch trims away a
    few of these not-needed attrs, saving some very tiny amount of memory.
    
    Updates #26186
