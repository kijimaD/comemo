    os: fix TestDevNullFile on Plan 9
    
    CL 102457 added TestDevNullFile. However, this
    test is failing on Plan 9, because it checks
    that /dev/null is a character device while there
    are no special files on Plan 9.
    
    We fix this issue by changing Stat to consider
    all files served by the console device (#c)
    as character devices.
    
    Fixes #24534.
