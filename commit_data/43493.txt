    net/url: add URL.Redacted to return a password scrubbed string
    
    Returning an URL.String() without the password is very useful for
    situations where the URL is supposed to be logged and the password is
    not useful to be shown.
    
    This method re-uses URL.String() but with the password scrubbed and
    substituted for a "xxxxx" in order to make it obvious that there was a
    password. If the URL had no password then no "xxxxx" will be shown.
    
    Fixes #34855
