    go/build: add Package.IgnoredOtherFiles
    
    Just like it is useful to report ignored .go files,
    it is also useful to report ignored non-.go files.
    
    Also, remove _* and .* files from IgnoredGoFiles.
    The fact that they were there at all was a mistake.
    This list is for files being ignored due to build constraints.
