    runtime: include os_*.h in the generated Go structs
    
    Adding the #include to defs.c makes it get processed
    by cmd/dist, which writes out Go equivalent for all the
    C data structures defined in defs.c.
    
    This in turn makes it necessary to define the Plink type,
    used in os_plan9.h, in os_plan9.go. Rename it to _Plink
    to avoid being exported.
