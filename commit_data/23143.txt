    runtime/race: fix failing tests
    
    Some race tests were sensitive to the goroutine scheduling order.
    When this changed in commit e870f06, these tests started to fail.
    
    Fix TestRaceHeapParam by ensuring that the racing goroutine has
    run before the test exits. Fix TestRaceRWMutexMultipleReaders by
    adding a third reader to ensure that two readers wind up on the
    same side of the writer (and race with each other) regardless of
    the schedule. Fix TestRaceRange by ensuring that the racing
    goroutine runs before the main goroutine exits the loop it races
    with.
