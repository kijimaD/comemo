    runtime: move pinned object out of inner loop for benchmarks
    
    In theory by allocating new objects every time, the benchmark is
    including the performance of allocating new pinner bits for a span. In
    practice however, most of the time each span already does have pinner
    bits allocated (it's still a rare operation).
    
    We can get a better sense of the raw cost of pinning an object (minus
    pinner bits allocation) by moving the object allocation out of the inner
    loop.
