    cmd/pack: treat compiler's -linkobj output as "compiler object"
    
    Treat the compiler's -linkobj output as "compiler object, which
    means "pack c" will "see through" the file and add individual
    entry to the new archive, instead of the object as a whole.
    
    This is somewhat peculiar. But Go 1.15's cmd/pack does this,
    although seemingly accidental. We just do the same. FWIW, it
    does make things more consistent with/without -linkobj flag.
    
    Fixes #43271.
