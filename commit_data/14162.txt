    math/big: add 4-bit, fixed window exponentiation.
    
    A 4-bit window is convenient because 4 divides both 32 and 64,
    therefore we never have a window spanning words of the exponent.
    Additionaly, the benefit of a 5-bit window is only 2.6% at 1024-bits
    and 3.3% at 2048-bits.
    
    This code is still not constant time, however.
