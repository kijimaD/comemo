    runtime: make return from main wait for active panic
    
    Arguably if this happens the program is buggy anyway,
    but letting the panic continue looks better than interrupting it.
    Otherwise things like this are possible, and confusing:
    
    $ go run x.go
    panic: $ echo $?
    0
    $
    
    Fixes #3934.
