    debug/dwarf: compute ByteSize for more DWARF types
    
    When AttrByteSize is not present for a type, we can still determine the
    size in two more cases: when the type is a Typedef referring to another
    type, and when the type is a pointer and we know the default address
    size.
    
    entry.go: return after setting an error if the offset is out of range.
