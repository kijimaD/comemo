    runtime: don't unwind past asmcgocall
    
    asmcgocall switches to the system stack and aligns the SP, so
    gentraceback both can't unwind over it when it appears on the system
    stack (it'll read some uninitialized stack slot as the return PC).
    There's also no point in unwinding over it, so don't.
    
    Updates #23576.
