    go/ast, go/doc, godoc: consider struct fields and interface methods when filtering ASTs
    
    So far, only top-level names where considered when trimming ASTs
    using a filter function. For instance, "godoc reflect Implements"
    didn't show the "Implements" method of the type Interface because
    the local method name was not considered (on the other hand, "top-
    level" declared methods associated with types were considered).
    
    With this CL, AST filter functions look also at struct fields
    and interface methods.
