    log/slog: don't call SetDefault in examples
    
    Replace the default Logger in some examples with a locally constructed
    Logger.
    
    Calling SetDefault changes global state that could affect other tests.
    Although we could use a defer to restore the state, that clutters
    the example and would not work if tests were run concurrently.
