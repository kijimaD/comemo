    all: join some chained ifs to unindent code
    
    Found with mvdan.cc/unindent. It skipped the cases where parentheses
    would need to be added, where comments would have to be moved elsewhere,
    or where actions and simple logic would mix.
    
    One of them was of the form "err != nil && err == io.EOF", so the first
    part was removed.
