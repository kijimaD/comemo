    spec: match syntax for method expressions with implementations
    
    A method expression is of the form T.m where T is a type and m
    is a method of that type. The spec restricted T essentially to
    a type name. Both cmd/compile and go/types accepted any type
    syntactically, and a method expression was really just a form
    of a selector expression x.f where x denotes a type.
    
    This CL removes the spec syntax restriction from MethodExpr
    to match the actual implementation. It also moves MethodExpr
    from Operand to PrimaryExpr, because that's what it is.
    
    It still keeps the separate notion of MethodExpr even though
    it looks just like a selector expresion, since a MethodExpr
    must start with a type rather than a value, and the spec's
    syntax expresses this bit of semantics via distinct productions
    (e.g., conversions look like calls but also must start with
    a type).
    
    Fixes #9060.
