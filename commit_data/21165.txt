    [dev.garbage] runtime: add prefetcht0, prefetcht1, prefetcht2, prefetcht3, prefetchnta for GC
    
    We don't know what we need yet, so add them all.
    Add them even on x86 architectures (as no-ops) so that
    the GC can refer to them unconditionally.
    
    Eventually we'll know what we want and probably
    have just one 'prefetch' with an appropriate meaning
    on each architecture.
