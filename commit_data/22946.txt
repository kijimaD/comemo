    net: increase timeout in TestWriteTimeoutFluctuation on darwin/arm
    
    On darwin/arm, the test sometimes fails with:
    
    Process 557 resuming
    --- FAIL: TestWriteTimeoutFluctuation (1.64s)
            timeout_test.go:706: Write took over 1s; expected 0.1s
    FAIL
    Process 557 exited with status = 1 (0x00000001)
    go_darwin_arm_exec: timeout running tests
    
    This change increaes timeout on iOS builders from 1s to 3s as a
    temporarily fix.
    
    Updates #10775.
