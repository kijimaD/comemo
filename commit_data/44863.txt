    runtime: non-strict InlTreeIndex lookup in Frames.Next
    
    When using cgo, some of the frames can be provided by cgoTraceback, a
    cgo-provided function to generate C tracebacks. Unlike Go tracebacks,
    cgoTraceback has no particular guarantees that it produces valid
    tracebacks.
    
    If one of the (invalid) frames happens to put the PC in the alignment
    region at the end of a function (filled with int 3's on amd64), then
    Frames.Next will find a valid funcInfo for the PC, but pcdatavalue will
    panic because PCDATA doesn't cover this PC.
    
    Tolerate this case by doing a non-strict PCDATA lookup. We'll still show
    a bogus frame, but at least avoid throwing.
    
    Fixes #44971
