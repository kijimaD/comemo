    time: fix quickcheck test to avoid wraparounds
    
    When we call time.Unix(s, ns), the internal representation is
    s + 62135596800,  where 62135596800 is the number of
    seconds from Jan 1 1 to Jan 1 1970.
    
    If quickcheck generates numbers too close to 2^63,
    the addition can wraparound to make a very negative
    internal 64-bit value. Wraparounds are not guarded
    against, since they would not arise in any reasonable program,
    so just avoid testing near them.
    
    Fixes #52409.
