    runtime: fix scanning of gc work buffer
    
    GC types were not being generated for the garbage collector
    work buffer.  The markfor object was being collected as a result.
    This broke amd64p32 and maybe plan9 builds.  Why it didn't break
    every build I'm not sure...
    
    Fixes #8812
