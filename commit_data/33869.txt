    cmd/compile: simplify exporting ONAME nodes
    
    These two special cases are unnecessary:
    
    1) "~b%d" references only appear during walk, to handle "return"
    statements implicitly assigning to blank result parameters. Even if
    they could appear, the "inlined and customized version" accidentally
    diverged from p.sym in golang.org/cl/33911.
    
    2) The Vargen case is already identical to the default case, and it
    never overlaps with the remaining "T.method" case.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
