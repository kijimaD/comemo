    cmd/ld: drop gcargs, gclocals symbols from symbol table
    
    Update #6853
    
    Every function now has a gcargs and gclocals symbol
    holding associated garbage collection information.
    Put them all in the same meta-symbol as the go.func data
    and then drop individual entries from symbol table.
    
    Removing gcargs and gclocals reduces the size of a
    typical binary by 10%.
