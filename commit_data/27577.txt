    crypto/tls: reduce size of buffer in throughput benchmarks
    
    The Windows builders run the throughput benchmarks really slowly with a
    64kb buffer. Lowering it to 16kb brings the performance back into line
    with the other builders.
    
    This is a work-around to get the build green until we can figure out why
    the Windows builders are slow with the larger buffer size.
    
    Update #15899
