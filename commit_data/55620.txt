    runtime: use explicit NOFRAME on solaris/amd64
    
    This CL marks some solaris assembly functions as NOFRAME to avoid
    relying on the implicit amd64 NOFRAME heuristic, where NOSPLIT functions
    without stack were also marked as NOFRAME.
    
    While here, I've reduced the stack usage of runtimeÂ·sigtramp by
    16 bytes to compensate the additional 8 bytes from the stack-allocated
    frame pointer. There were two unused 8-byte slots on the stack, one
    at 24(SP) and the other at 80(SP).
    
    Updates #58378
