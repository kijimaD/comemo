    Revert "runtime: remove slow time compatibility hacks for wine"
    
    This reverts CL 191759.
    
    Reason for revert: broke most Go programs using the time package on Wine,
    including on 4.15, the latest stable version. Only wine-staging (with
    experimental patches) contains an upstream fix we could rely on.
