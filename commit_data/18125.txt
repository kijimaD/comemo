    runtime: load runtime.goarm as a byte, not a word
    
    Fixes #6952.
    
    runtime.asminit was incorrectly loading runtime.goarm as a word, not a uint8 which made it subject to alignment issues on arm5 platforms.
    
    Alignment aside, this also meant that the top 3 bytes in R11 would have been garbage and could not be assumed to be setting up the FPU reliably.
