    runtime: remove GODEBUG=gcrescanstacks=1 mode
    
    Currently, setting GODEBUG=gcrescanstacks=1 enables a debugging mode
    where the garbage collector re-scans goroutine stacks during mark
    termination. This was introduced in Go 1.8 to debug the hybrid write
    barrier, but I don't think we ever used it.
    
    Now it's one of the last sources of mark work during mark termination.
    This CL removes it.
    
    Updates #26903. This is preparation for unifying STW GC and concurrent
    GC.
    
    Updates #17503.
