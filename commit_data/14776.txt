    cmd/gc: mark wrapper methods for unnamed types as DUPOK.
    
    Unnamed types like structs with embedded fields can have methods.
    These methods are generated on-the-fly by the compiler and
    it may happen for identical types in different packages.
    The linker must accept these multiple definitions.
    
    Fixes #4590.
