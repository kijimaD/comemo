    path/filepath: fix race with other tests
    
    Bug3486 tried to walk the entire file tree, but other tests might
    be creating and removing files in that tree. In particular, package os
    creates and removes files in the os directory, and issue 5863
    reports failures due to seeing those files appear and then disappear.
    
    Change the test to walk just the test tree, which should not be
    changing.
    
    Fixes #5863.
