    net/http: fix ordering & data race in TestTransportEventTrace_h2
    
    Ordering fix: this CL swaps the order of the log write and the channel close
    in WroteRequest. I could reproduce the bug by putting a sleep between the two
    when the channel close was first. It needs to happen after the log.
    
    Data race: use the log buffer's mutex when reading too. Not really
    important once the ordering fix above is fixed (since nobody is
    concurrently writing anymore), but for consistency.
    
    Fixes #16414
