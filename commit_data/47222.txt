    cmd/go: don't report missing std import errors for tidy and vendor
    
    'go mod tidy' and 'go mod vendor' normally report errors when a
    package can't be imported, even if the import appears in a file that
    wouldn't be compiled by the current version of Go. These errors are
    common for packages introduced in higher versions of Go, like "embed"
    in 1.16.
    
    This change causes 'go mod tidy' and 'go mod vendor' to ignore
    missing package errors if the import path appears to come from the
    standard library because it lacks a dot in the first path element.
    
    Fixes #44557
    Updates #27063
