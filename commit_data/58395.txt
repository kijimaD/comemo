    cmd/link: make dwarf name slice index self-describing
    
    cmd/compile/internal/dwarfgen.createComplexVar does it this way, which
    has the nice property of documenting the expected prefix.
    
    This is primarily for newtype, since defgotype checks for the prefix
    immediately prior, but I changed both for consistency.
