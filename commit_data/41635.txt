    [dev.link] cmd/link: record go.itablink symbols during object file read
    
    Change the new loader to keep a note of the set of "go.itablink.*"
    symbols (using a small map), and add a method that clients can use to
    query whether a given global index corresponds to a "go.itablink.*"
    sym. This eliminates one instance of raw symbol name reading/matching
    during new deadcode, which should produce a minor speedup.
