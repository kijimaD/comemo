    cmd/go, cmd/dist: collect known cross-package uses of runtime symbols
    
    This extends cmd/go's symabis support to collect known cross-package
    uses of runtime symbols from other "basically runtime" packages in
    std. This avoids having to declare a large number of ABI0 symbols in
    the runtime for a small number of known cross-package references.
    
    For cmd/dist, we use a simpler but less efficient approach and tell
    the compiler to generate ABI wrappers for everything.
