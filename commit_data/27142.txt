    cmd/internal/obj: sort relocs by off when printing
    
    This makes the output of compiling with -S more
    stable in the face of unimportant variation in the
    order in which relocs are generated.
    It is also more pleasant to read the relocs when
    they are sorted.
    
    Also, do some minor cleanup.
    
    For #14786
