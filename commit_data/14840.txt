    cmd/go: remove $GOROOT as a go get target
    
    Fixes #4186.
    
    Back in the day, before the Go 1.0 release, $GOROOT was mandatory for building from source. Fast forward to now and $GOPATH is mandatory and $GOROOT is optional, and mainly used by those who use the binary distribution in uncommon places.
    
    For example, most novices at least know about `sudo` as they would have used it to install the binary tarball into /usr/local. It is logical they would use the `sudo` hammer to `go get` other Go packages when faced with a permission error talking about the path they just had to use `sudo` on last time.
    
    Even if they had read the documentation and set $GOPATH, go get will not work as expected as `sudo` masks most environment variables.
    
    llucky(~) % ~/go/bin/go env | grep GOPATH
    GOPATH="/home/dfc"
    lucky(~) % sudo ~/go/bin/go env | grep GOPATH
    GOPATH=""
    
    This CL therefore proposes to remove support for using `go get` to download source into $GOROOT.
    
    This CL also proposes an error when GOPATH=$GOROOT, as this is another place where new Go users can get stuck.
