    net/http: fix a data race when Request.Cancel is used
    
    The "add a Request.Cancel channel" change (https://golang.org/cl/11601)
    added support for "race free" cancellation, but introduced a data race. :)
    
    Noticed while running "go test -race net/http". The test is skipped in
    short mode, so we never saw it on the dashboard.
