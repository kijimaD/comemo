    cmd/link: clean up dwarf.go
    
    Try to remove the most visible artefacts resulting from the
    C to Go translation. It includes:
    
    - refactoring the find function to eliminate goto and variable declarations
    - removing useless variables still having a _ = xxx
    - decreasing the number of upfront variable declarations
    
    No semantic changes.
