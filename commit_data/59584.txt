    runtime: print blocking status of bubbled goroutines in stacks
    
    For goroutines in a synctest bubble, include whether the goroutine
    is "durably blocked" or not in the goroutine status.
    
    Synctest categorizes goroutines in certain states as "durably"
    blocked, where the goroutine is not merely idle but can only
    be awoken by another goroutine in its bubble. To make it easier
    for users to understand why a bubble is or is not idle,
    print the state of each bubbled goroutine.
    
    For example:
    
      goroutine 36 [chan receive, synctest bubble 34, not durably blocked]:
      goroutine 37 [chan receive (synctest), synctest bubble 34, durably blocked]:
    
    Goroutine 36 is receiving from a channel created outside its bubble.
    Goroutine 36 is receiving from a channel created inside its bubble.
