    cmd/dist: log CPU model when testing
    
    Knowing whether test failures are correlated with specific CPU models on
    has proven useful on several issues. Log it for prior to testing so it
    is always available.
    
    internal/sysinfo provides the CPU model, but it is not available in the
    bootstrap toolchain, so we can't access this in cmd/dist. Instead use a
    separate binary which cmd/dist will only build once testing begins.
    
    The addition of new data to the beginning of cmd/dist output will break
    x/build/cmd/coordinator's banner parsing, leaving extra lines in the log
    output, though information will not be lost.
    https://golang.org/cl/372538 fixes up the coordinator and should be
    submitted and deployed before this CL is submitted.
    
    This is a redo of CL 371474. It switches back to the original approach
    of using a separate binary, as the bootstap toolchain won't allow
    cmd/dist to import internal packages.
    
    For #46272.
    For #49209.
    For #50146.
