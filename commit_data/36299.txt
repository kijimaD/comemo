    fmt: make %v doc for compound objects consistent
    
    The documentation for %v behavior for compound objects uses an ellipsis
    to indicate indefinite lenght of elements. This is done for struct
    fields as well as elements of arrays and slices. This adds the missing
    ellipsis for maps.
