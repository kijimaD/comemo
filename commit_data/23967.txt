    cmd/compile: fix half multiply issue
    
    In walkdiv, an OMUL node was created and passed to typecheck,
    before the op was changed back to OHMUL.  In some instances,
    the node that came back was an evaluated literal constant that
    occurred with a full multiply.  The end result was a literal node
    with a non-shifted value and an OHMUL op. This change causes code
    to be generated for the OHMUL.
    
    Fixes #11358
    Fixes #11369
