    [dev.link] cmd/asm: new -p option, changes to DWARF generation
    
    Adds a new "-p" option to the assembler, for specifying the import
    path of the package being compiled. DWARF generation is now conditional
    on having a valid package path -- if we don't know the package path,
    then don't emit DWARF.
    
    This is intended to lay the groundwork for removing the various
    "patchDWARFname" hacks in the linker.
