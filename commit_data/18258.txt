    cmd/pack: rewrite in Go
    Replace the pack command, a C program, with a clean reimplementation in Go.
    It does not need to reproduce the full feature set and it is no longer used by
    the build chain, but has a role in looking inside archives created by the build
    chain directly.
    
    Since it's not in C, it is no longer build by dist, so remove it from cmd/dist and
    make it a "tool" in cmd/go terminology.
    
    Fixes #2705
