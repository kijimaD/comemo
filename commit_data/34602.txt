    cmd/compile: turn some pointer params into results
    
    These are likely from the time when gc was written in C. There is no
    need for any of these to be passed pointers, as the previous values are
    not kept in any way, and the pointers are never nil. Others were left
    untouched as they fell into one of these useful cases.
    
    While at it, also turn some 0/1 integers into booleans.
    
    Passes toolstash -cmp on std cmd.
