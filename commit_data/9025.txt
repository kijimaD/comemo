    image: re-organize draw.go.
    
    There are no behavioral changes, only some copy-and-pastes.
    
    Before, drawFillOver was next to drawCopyOver.
    
    After, drawFillOver is next to drawFillSrc, which is more similar to
    drawFillOver than drawCopyOver is.
    
    Similarly, drawCopyOver is now next to drawCopySrc, etc.
