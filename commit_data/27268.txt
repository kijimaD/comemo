    testing: prepare for the introduction of Run methods
    
    The biggest change is that each test is now responsible for managing
    the starting and stopping of its parallel subtests.
    
    The "Main" test could be run as a tRunner as well. This shows that
    the introduction of subtests is merely a generalization of and
    consistent with the current semantics.
