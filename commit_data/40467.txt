    cmd/vet/all: delete
    
    The work of running full vet on std and cmd during local development
    has moved to go test, which of course runs during all.bash.
    
    For errors in other GOOS/GOARCH combinations, the misc-compile
    builders (running buildall.bash) also now run go vet std cmd.
    
    The vetall builder need not do anything anymore.
    Make it a no-op until it can be retired, and remove
    cmd/vet/all and its special case in the go command.
    
    Fixes #31916.
