    cmd/go: for go get -insecure, skip TLS certificate checking
    
    The flag is already named -insecure. Make it more so.
    
    If we're willing to accept HTTP, it's not much worse to accept
    HTTPS man-in-the-middle attacks too. This allows servers
    with self-signed certificates to work.
    
    Fixes #13197.
