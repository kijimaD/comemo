    cmd/compile: defer transitive inlining until after AST is edited
    
    This CL changes the inliner to process transitive inlining iteratively
    after the AST has actually been edited, rather than recursively and
    immediately. This is important for handling indirect function calls
    correctly, because ir.reassigned walks the function body looking for
    reassignments; whereas previously the inlined reassignments might not
    have been actually added to the AST yet.
    
    Fixes #54632.
