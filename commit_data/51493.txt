    go/types, types2: simplify missingMethodReason
    
    Added a funcString helper so we don't need to rewrite strings
    with strings.Replace.
    
    Use compiler format for error message about wrong method type;
    this removes another unnecessary variation.
    
    Simplify conditions for pointer-to-interface related error:
    if one of the involved types is an interface pointer, it can't
    have any methods.
    
    Rewrite logic so we don't need all the else-if branches.
    
    Adjusted a test case for types2 accordingly. The go/types version
    of this test case has a different error because the implementation
    of Checker.typeAssertion is different in the two type checkers
    (the types2 version gives errors closer to the 1.17 compiler).
