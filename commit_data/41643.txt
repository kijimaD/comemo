    os/exec: re-enable TestExtraFiles checks skipped on various OSes
    
    The issues associated with these skipped checks are closed.
    If they are working around unfixed bugs, the issues should remain open.
    If they are working around unfixable properties of the system, the skips
    should refer to those properties rather than closed issues.
