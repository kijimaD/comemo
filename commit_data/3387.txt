    - added gcmp for proper ACMP generation, changed all call
      sites plus optimized constant code a bit (one less register
      used).
    - changed conditional branches, might need a re-tweak later
    - gave up on agen OINDEX and copied/fixed the version in 8g
    
    go/test: passes 66% (225/339)
