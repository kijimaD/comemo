    asn1: Fixes and additions to marshalling
    
    Marshalling:
    * Fixes several silly bugs.
    * Support the RawContents type.
    * Support the RawValue type.
    * Recurse into nested interface{}.
    
    Both directions:
    * Better handling of SETs. You can now tag an element in a
      structure with "set" to get the correct tag for serialisation.
    * For types that aren't in a structure, you can now name them
      with "SET" on the end.
    * SETs are no longer implicitly treated as SEQUENCEs.
