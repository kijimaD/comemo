    cmd/go: don't assume ImportStack always set on PackageError
    
    When determining DepsErrors for packages, we were trying to sort
    errors by the top package on their ImportStack (which would likely be
    the package the error was generated for) to get a deterministic
    error order.
    
    The problem is that some PackageErrors don't have ImportStacks set on
    them. Fall back to sorting the errors by the error text (instead of
    making things more complicated by tracking the packages that produced
    the errors more closely).
    
    Fixes #59905
