commit 536c2aa6aebc7b89b9c57e09b41985875aa1aa01

    URL should have an empty Scheme if there is an invalid character (i.e.
    not [a-zA-Z0-9+-.]) before there is a ":".
    
    This is particularly helpful in the erroneous-but-relatively-common
    case of relative URLs containing an unescaped colon in the query
    string--see the added test for an example.
