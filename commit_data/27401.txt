    all: delete dead non-test code
    
    This change removes a lot of dead code. Some of the code has never been
    used, not even when it was first commited. The rest shouldn't have
    survived refactors.
    
    This change doesn't remove unused routines helpful for debugging, nor
    does it remove code that's used in commented out blocks of code that are
    only unused temporarily. Furthermore, unused constants weren't removed
    when they were part of a set of constants from specifications.
    
    One noteworthy omission from this CL are about 1000 lines of unused code
    in cmd/fix, 700 lines of which are the typechecker, which hasn't been
    used ever since the pre-Go 1 fixes have been removed. I wasn't sure if
    this code should stick around for future uses of cmd/fix or be culled as
    well.
