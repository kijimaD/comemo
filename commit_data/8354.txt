    http: write cookies according to RFC 6265
    
    RFC 6265 requires that user agents MUST NOT send more than
    one Cookie header in a request.
    
    Note, this change also fixes an issue when sending requests
    with more than one cookie header line to a php script served
    by an apache web server.  Apache concatenates the cookies
    with ", ", but php tries to split them only at ";".  E.g.
    two cookies: "a=b, c=d" are seen by php as one cookie "a"
    with the value "b, c=d".
    
    Fixes #1801
