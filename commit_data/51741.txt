    runtime: remove unused badsignal2 on windows
    
    This CL removes badsignal2 function, as it is unused on Windows.
    
    badsignal2 was originally intended to abort the process when
    an exception was raised on a non-Go thread, following the same approach
    as Linux and others.
    
    Since it was added, back on https://golang.org/cl/5797068, it has caused
    several issues on Windows, see #8224 and #50877. That's because we can't
    know wether the signal is bad or not, as our trap might not be at the
    end of the exception handler chain.
    
    To fix those issues, https://golang.org/cl/104200046 and CL 442896
    stopped calling badsignal2, and CL 458135 removed one last incorrect
    call on amd64 and 386.
