    cmd/compile: automatically handle commuting ops in rewrite rules
    
    We have lots of rewrite rules that vary only in the fact that
    we have 2 versions for the 2 different orderings of various
    commuting ops. For example:
    
    (ADDL x (MOVLconst [c])) -> (ADDLconst [c] x)
    (ADDL (MOVLconst [c]) x) -> (ADDLconst [c] x)
    
    It can get unwieldly quickly, especially when there is more than
    one commuting op in a rule.
    
    Our existing "fix" for this problem is to have rules that
    canonicalize the operations first. For example:
    
    (Eq64 x (Const64 <t> [c])) && x.Op != OpConst64 -> (Eq64 (Const64 <t> [c]) x)
    
    Subsequent rules can then assume if there is a constant arg to Eq64,
    it will be the first one. This fix kinda works, but it is fragile and
    only works when we remember to include the required extra rules.
    
    The fundamental problem is that the rule matcher doesn't
    know anything about commuting ops. This CL fixes that fact.
    
    We already have information about which ops commute. (The register
    allocator takes advantage of commutivity.)  The rule generator now
    automatically generates multiple rules for a single source rule when
    there are commutative ops in the rule. We can now drop all of our
    almost-duplicate source-level rules and the canonicalization rules.
    
    I have some CLs in progress that will be a lot less verbose when
    the rule generator handles commutivity for me.
    
    I had to reorganize the load-combining rules a bit. The 8-way OR rules
    generated 128 different reorderings, which was causing the generator
    to put too much code in the rewrite*.go files (the big ones were going
    from 25K lines to 132K lines). Instead I reorganized the rules to
    combine pairs of loads at a time. The generated rule files are now
    actually a bit (5%) smaller.
    [Note to reviewers: check these carefully. Most of the other rule
    changes are trivial.]
    
    Make.bash times are ~unchanged.
    
    Compiler benchmarks are not observably different. Probably because
    we don't spend much compiler time in rule matching anyway.
    
    I've also done a pass over all of our ops adding commutative markings
    for ops which hadn't had them previously.
    
    Fixes #18292
