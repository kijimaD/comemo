    net/http: Fix test that occasionally fails
    
    The consecutive calls to Head would sometimes get different
    connections depending on if the readLoop had finished executing
    and placed its connection on the idle list or not.  This change
    ensures that readLoop completes before we make our second connection.
    
    Fixes #11250
