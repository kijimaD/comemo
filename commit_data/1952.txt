commit 07687705a4c2db718a3601d3558807833938dfbf

    type n t;
    was copying a bit too much about t into n,
    like whether the signature was queued to be printed.
    (bug reported by anton)
    
    was also editing t, meaning you could do
            type T int;
            func (p int) Meth() { }
    
    both fixed.
