    syscall: some containers may fail syscall.TestSetuidEtc
    
    The test previously had the hardcoded assumption that /proc/self/status
    files had "Groups:" lines containing numerical IDs in ascending order.
    Because of the possibility of non-monotonic ordering of GIDs in user
    namespaces, this assumption was not universally true for all
    /proc/self/gid_map setups.
    
    To ensure this test can pass in those setups, sanity check failed
    "Groups:" line matches with a string sorted version of the expected
    values. (For the test cases here, numerical and string sorted order
    are guaranteed to match.)
    
    Fixes #46145
