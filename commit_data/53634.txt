    cmd/compile/internal/ssagen: fix min/max codegen, again
    
    The large-function phi placement algorithm evidently doesn't like the
    same pseudo-variable being used to represent expressions of varying
    types.
    
    Instead, use the same tactic as used for "valVar" (ssa.go:6585--6587),
    which is to just generate a fresh marker node each time.
    
    Maybe we could just use the OMIN/OMAX nodes themselves as the key
    (like we do for OANDAND/OOROR), but that just seems needlessly risky
    for negligible memory savings. Using fresh marker values each time
    seems obviously safe by comparison.
    
    Fixes #61041.
