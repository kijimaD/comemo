commit e64d337726542492f5a3610229e4e112eda77389
Author: Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 30 15:26:53 2011 -0700

    scanner: treat line comments like in Go
    
    - don't consume '\n' as part of line comment
    (otherwise grammars where '\n' are tokens won't
    see them after a line comment)
    
    - permit line comments to end in EOF
