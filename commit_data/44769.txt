    runtime: support long paths without fixup on Windows 10 >= 1607
    
    Windows 10 >= 1607 allows CreateFile and friends to use long paths if
    bit 0x80 of the PEB's BitField member is set.
    
    In time this means we'll be able to entirely drop our long path hacks,
    which have never really worked right (see bugs below). Until that point,
    we'll simply have things working well on recent Windows.
