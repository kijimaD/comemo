    cmd/compile: make TestAssembly resilient to output ordering
    
    To preserve reproducible builds, the text entries
    during compilation will be sorted before being printed.
    TestAssembly currently assumes that function init
    comes after all user-defined functions.
    Remove that assumption.
    Instead of looking for "TEXT" to tell you where
    a function ends--which may now yield lots of
    non-function-code junk--look for a line beginning
    with non-whitespace.
