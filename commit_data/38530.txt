    cmd/internal/obj: don't dedup symbols in WriteObjFile
    
    Currently, WriteObjFile deduplicates symbols by name. This is a
    strange and unexpected place to do this. But, worse, there's no
    checking that it's reasonable to deduplicate two symbols, so this
    makes it incredibly easy to mask errors involving duplicate symbols.
    Dealing with duplicate symbols is better left to the linker. We're
    also about to introduce multiple symbols with the same name but
    different ABIs/versions, which would make this deduplication more
    complicated. We just removed the only part of the compiler that
    actually depended on this behavior.
    
    This CL removes symbol deduplication from WriteObjFile, since it is no
    longer needed.
    
    For #27539.
