    image: avoid sharing test images between tests and benchmarks
    
    CL 136796 introduced benchmarks and refactored tests to use a
    common list of test images. The tests now fail when run with
    count > 2 since they rely on a fresh image each run.
    
    Fix this by changing the list of test images to a list of test
    image generator functions.
