    runtime: fix abort handling on arm64
    
    The implementation of runtime.abort on arm64 currently branches to
    address 0, which results in a signal from PC 0, rather than from
    runtime.abort, so the runtime fails to recognize it as an abort.
    
    Fix runtime.abort on arm64 to read from address 0 like what other
    architectures do and recognize this in the signal handler.
    
    Should fix the linux/arm64 build.
