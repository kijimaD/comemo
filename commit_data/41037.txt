    cmd/compile: fix internal error on complex comparison
    
    Complex type is the only TIDEAL that lack of support for all comparison
    operators. When rewriting constant comparison into literal node, that
    missing cause compiler raise an internal error.
    
    Checking the operator is available for complex type before that fix the
    problem.
    
    We can make this check works more generally if there's more type lack of
    supporting all comparison operators added, but it does not seem to be
    happened, so just check explicitly for complex only.
    
    Fixes #32723
