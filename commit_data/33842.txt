    cmd/cgo: make JNI's jobject type map to uintptr in Go
    
    The jobject type is declared as a pointer, but some JVMs
    (Dalvik, ART) store non-pointer values in them. In Go, we must
    use uintptr instead of a real pointer for these types.
    
    This is similar to the CoreFoundation types on Darwin which
    were "fixed" in CL 66332.
