    bufio: new Scanner interface
    
    Add a new, simple interface for scanning (probably textual) data,
    based on a new type called Scanner. It does its own internal buffering,
    so should be plausibly efficient even without injecting a bufio.Reader.
    The format of the input is defined by a "split function", by default
    splitting into lines. Other implemented split functions include single
    bytes, single runes, and space-separated words.
    
    Here's the loop to scan stdin as a file of lines:
    
            s := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
            for s.Scan() {
                    fmt.Printf("%s\n", s.Bytes())
            }
            if s.Err() != nil {
                    log.Fatal(s.Err())
            }
    
    While we're dealing with spaces, define what space means to strings.Fields.
    
    Fixes #4802.
