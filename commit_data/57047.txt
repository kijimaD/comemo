    cmd/dist: do not use user build cache in versioned trees
    
    There is no guarantee that the user build cache will have
    correct data if we are using a versioned build (with a VERSION file),
    because that overrides the use of tool build IDs for staleness.
    An earlier build might have run with a buggy compiler, and we don't
    want those files lying around.
