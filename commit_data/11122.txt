    goyacc: fix units.y build breakage
    This breakage is mainly due to API changes in pkg.
    (e.g., package utf8 moved to unicode/utf8;
           remove of strconv.Atof64;
           change character type from int to rune.)
    Also correct the usage comment.
    
    This fixes issue 2646.
    PS: I don't change the goyacc.go, because I think token type
        should not be force to rune.
