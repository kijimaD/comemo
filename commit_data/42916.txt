    cmd/asm: fix the error of checking the post-index offset of VLD[1-4]R instructions of arm64
    
    The post-index offset of VLD[1-4]R instructions is decided by the
    "size" field not "Q" field, the current assembler uses "Q" fileld
    to check the correctness of post-index offset which is not correct.
    This patch fixes it.
    
    Fixes #40725
