    doc/articles/race_detector: mention memory leak potential
    
    As far as I can tell, there is no public documentation on this topic,
    which cost me several days of debugging.
    
    I am possibly unusual in that I run binaries in production with the
    race detector turned on, but I think that others who do the same may
    want to be aware of the risk.
    
    Updates #26813.
    Updates #37233.
