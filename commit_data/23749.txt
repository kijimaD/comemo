    runtime: clarify runtime.GC blocking behavior
    
    The runtime.GC documentation was rewritten in df2809f to make it clear
    that it blocks until GC is complete, but the re-rewrite in ed9a4c9 and
    e28a679 lost this property when clarifying that it may also block the
    entire program and not just the caller.
    
    Try to arrive at wording that conveys both of these properties.
