    runtime: add debugger hook for fatal signals
    
    On Go <= 1.20 signals that caused the program to exit would eventually
    call runtime.fatal. After the changes made in go.dev/cl/462437 but it
    would still be nice if debuggers (eg. Delve) had a function they could
    hook to intercept fatal signals.
