    net/http: fix RoundTrip context cancellation for js/wasm
    
    The existing js/wasm implementation of RoundTrip calls abort() on the
    fetch() call when the context is canceled but does not wait for for the
    resulting promise to be rejected. The result is the failure callback for the
    promise will be called at some later point in time when the promise
    rejection is handled. In some case this callback may be called after the Go
    program has exited resulting in "Go program has already exited" errors.
    
    Fixes #57098
