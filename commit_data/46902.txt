    [dev.regabi] go/types: refuse excessively long constants
    
    This is a port of CL 289049 to go/types. In that CL, tests were written
    using the ability of tests/run.go to generate test packages dynamically.
    For this CL, similar functionality is added to the go/types errmap
    tests: tests are refactored to decouple the loading of source code from
    the filesystem, so that tests for long constants may be generated
    dynamically rather than checked-in as a large testdata file.
