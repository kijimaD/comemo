    syscall: selectively update zerrors_* on openbsd/386, openbsd/arm and openbsd/amd64
    
    The EBADMSG, ENOTRECOVERABLE, EOWNERDEAD and EPROTO Errno are missing
    on openbsd/386, openbsd/arm and openbsd/amd64. These are the earliest
    OpenBSD ports and they did not exist in the system headers when the
    relevant zerror_* file was generated.
    
    These exist for all other ports, hence it makes sense to add them
    for consistency. Update error and signal strings so that they are
    also consistent across OpenBSD ports.
    
    Fixes #67998
