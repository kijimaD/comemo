    runtime: fix stack memory test
    
    Stand-alone this test is fine.  Run together with
    others, however, the stack used can actually go
    negative because other tests are freeing stack
    during its execution.
    
    This behavior is new with the new stack allocator.
    The old allocator never returned (min-sized) stacks.
    
    This test is fairly poor - it needs to run in
    isolation to be accurate.  Maybe we should delete it.
