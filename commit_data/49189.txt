    [dev.cmdgo] cmd/go: add -testsum flag to update go.sum in script tests
    
    -testsum may be set to "tidy", "listm", or "listall". When set,
    TestScript runs 'go mod tidy', 'go list -m -mod=mod all', or
    'go list -mod=mod all' at the beginning of each test that has a go.mod
    file in its root directory. If the test passes and go.mod or go.sum
    was updated, TestScript will rewrite the test file with the initial
    content of go.mod and go.sum (after the above command).
    
    This is useful for writing tests that need a working go.sum and for
    fixing tests that rely on -mod=mod.
    
    For golang/go#41302
