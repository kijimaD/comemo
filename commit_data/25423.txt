    runtime/pprof: skip TestStackBarrierProfiling
    
    This test triggers a large number of usleep(100)s. linux/arm, openbsd,
    and solaris have very poor timer resolution on the builders, so
    usleep(100) actually gives up the whole scheduling quantum. On Linux
    and OpenBSD (and probably Solaris), profiling signals are only
    generated when a process completes a whole scheduling quantum, so this
    test often gets zero profiling signals and fails.
    
    Until we figure out what to do about this, skip this test on these
    platforms.
    
    Updates #13405.
