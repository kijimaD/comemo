    runtime: strongly encourage CallersFrames with the result of Callers
    
    For historical reasons, it's still commonplace to iterate over the
    slice returned by runtime.Callers and call FuncForPC on each PC. This
    is broken in gccgo and somewhat broken in gc and will become more
    broken in gc with mid-stack inlining.
    
    In Go 1.7, we introduced runtime.CallersFrames to deal with these
    problems, but didn't strongly direct people toward using it. Reword
    the documentation on runtime.Callers to more strongly encourage people
    to use CallersFrames and explicitly discourage them from iterating
    over the PCs or using FuncForPC on the results.
    
    Fixes #19426.
