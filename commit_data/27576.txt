    syscall: plan9 - mark gbit16 as go:nosplit
    
    This is a correction to CL 22610.  The gbit16 function is called in
    StartProcess between fork and exec, and therefore must not split the
    stack.  Normally it's inlined so this is not an issue, but on one
    occasion I've observed it to be compiled without inlining, and the
    result was a panic.  Mark it go:nosplit to be safe.
