    archive/tar: centralize all information about tar header format
    
    The Reader and Writer have hard-coded constants regarding the
    offsets and lengths of certain fields in the tar format sprinkled
    all over. This makes it harder to verify that the offsets are
    correct since a reviewer would need to search for them throughout
    the code. Instead, all information about the layout of header
    fields should be centralized in one single file. This has the
    advantage of being both centralized, and also acting as a form
    of documentation about the header struct format.
    
    This method was chosen over using "encoding/binary" since that
    method would cause an allocation of a header struct every time
    binary.Read was called. This method causes zero allocations and
    its logic is no longer than if structs were declared.
