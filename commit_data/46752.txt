    [dev.typeparams] go/constant: in ToFloat, convert to rational numbers, not floats
    
    Floating-point constants are represented as rational numbers when
    possible (i.e., when numerators and denominators are not too large).
    If we convert to floats when not necessary, we risk losing precision.
    
    This is the minimal fix for the specific issue, but it's too aggressive:
    If the numbers are too large, we still want to convert to floats.
    Will address in a separate CL that also does a few related cleanups.
    
    Fixes #43908.
