    [dev.link] ensure package path is set when TEXT symbols are created
    
    We're reworking pclntab generation in the linker, and with that we're
    moving FuncID generation in to the compiler. Determining the FuncID is
    done by a lookup on the package.function name; therefore, we need the
    package whenever we make the TEXT symbols.
