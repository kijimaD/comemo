    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: remove race-y check in Name.Canonical
    
    The backend doesn't synchronize compilation of functions with their
    enclosed function literals, so it's not safe to double-check that
    IsClosureVar isn't set on the underlying Name. Plenty of frontend
    stuff would blow-up if this was wrong anyway, so it should be fine to
    omit.
