          undo CL 6493071 / 56c7453d488f
    
    This change messes with anchor links. It obscures the item being linked to.
    I don't see a way around it. Undoing for now.
    
          Fixes #4071.
    
          ««« original CL description
          doc css: topbar sticks to the top of large windows.
          Rationale: for large screens, the convenience of not having to scroll
          to the top of the page to do a search outweighs having less vertical
          space.
          Tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari with various window and text sizes.
