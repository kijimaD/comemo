    [dev.link] cmd/link: set direct fn address in dwarf gen where possible
    
    If we are internal linking a static executable, and address assignment
    has happened, then when emitting some parts of DWARF we can just emit
    a function address directly instead of generating a relocation. For
    external linking or other build modes, we are generating a relocatable
    binary so we still need to emit relocations.
