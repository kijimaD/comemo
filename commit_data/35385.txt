    cmd/compile: plumb prologueEnd into DWARF
    
    This marks the first instruction after the prologue for
    consumption by debuggers, specifically Delve, who asked
    for it.  gdb appears to ignore it, lldb appears to use it.
    
    The bits for end-of-prologue and beginning-of-epilogue
    are added to Pos (reducing maximum line number by 4x, to
    1048575).  They're added in cmd/internal/obj/<ARCH>.go
    (currently x86 only), so the compiler-proper need not
    deal with them.
    
    The linker currently does nothing with beginning-of-epilogue,
    but the plumbing exists to make it easier in the future.
    
    This also upgrades the line number table to DWARF version 3.
    
    This CL includes a regression in the coverage for
    testdata/i22558.gdb-dbg.nexts, this appears to be a gdb
    artifact but the fix would be in the preceding CL in the
    stack.
