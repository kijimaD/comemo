    runtime: make explicit nil check in (*spanInlineMarkBits).init
    
    The hugo binary gets slower, potentially dramatically so, with
    GOEXPERIMENT=greenteagc. The root cause is page mapping churn. The Green
    Tea code introduced a new implicit nil check on value in a
    freshly-allocated span to clear some new heap metadata. This nil check
    would read the fresh memory, causing Linux to back that virtual address
    space with an RO page. This would then be almost immediately written to,
    causing Linux to possibly flush the TLB and find memory to replace that
    read-only page (likely deduplicated as just the zero page).
    
    This CL fixes the issue by replacing the implicit nil check, which is a
    memory read expected to fault if it's truly nil, with an explicit one.
    The explicit nil check is a branch, and thus makes no reads to memory.
    The result is that the hugo binary no longer gets slower.
    
    No regression test because it doesn't seem possible without access to OS
    internals, like Linux tracepoints. We briefly experimented with RSS
    metrics, but they're inconsistent. Some system RSS metrics count the
    deduplicated zero page, while others (like those produced by
    /proc/self/smaps) do not.
    
    Instead, we'll add a new benchmark to our benchmark suite, separately.
    
    For #73581.
    Fixes #74375.
