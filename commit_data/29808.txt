    cmd/pprof: instruction-level granularity in callgrind output
    
    When generating callgrind format output, produce cost lines at
    instruction granularity. This allows visualizers supporting the
    callgrind format to display instruction-level profiling information.
    
    We also need to provide the object file (ob=) in order for tools to find
    the object file to disassemble when displaying assembly.
    
    We opportunistically group cost lines corressponding to the same
    function together, reducing the number of superfluous description lines.
    Subposition compression (relative position numbering) is also used to
    reduce the output size.
