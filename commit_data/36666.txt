    time: improve error message for LoadLocation
    
    Currently, when a tz file was being checked inside a zoneInfo dir,
    a syscall.ENOENT error was being returned, which caused it to look
    in the zoneinfo.zip file and return an error for that case.
    
    We return a syscall.ENOENT error for the zip file case too, so that
    it falls through to the end of the loop and returns an uniform error
    for both cases.
    
    Fixes #20969
