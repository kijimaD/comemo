    go/types: use same local variable consistently (minor cleanup)
    
    Currently this CL has no effect because V == x.typ in the affected
    code. But if we should ever manipulate V (e.g., to support some form
    of lazy evaluation of the type), not using V consistently would
    lead to a subtle bug.
