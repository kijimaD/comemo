    net/http: handle absolute paths in mapDirOpenError
    
    The current implementation does not account for Dir being
    initialized with an absolute path on systems that start
    paths with filepath.Separator. In this scenario, the
    original error is returned, and not checked for file
    segments.
    
    This change adds a test for this case, and corrects the
    behavior by ignoring blank path segments in the loop.
