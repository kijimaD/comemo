    net/http: remove invalid checks of Request.Proto* for outgoing requests
    
    The net/http package has long documented that Request.ProtoMajor and
    Request.ProtoMinor are ignored for outgoing requests (HTTP/1.1 or
    HTTP/2 is always used, never HTTP/1.0). There was one part in the code
    that was actually checking 1.0 vs 1.1, but it appears to have been
    harmless. Remove it.
    
    Fixes #18407
