    cmd/compile: add more non-ID comparisons to schedule
    
    These comparisons are fairly arbitrary,
    but they should be more stable in the face
    of other compiler changes than value ID.
    
    This reduces the number of value ID
    comparisons in schedule while running
    make.bash from 542,442 to 99,703.
    
    There are lots of changes to generated code
    from this change, but they appear to
    be overall neutral.
    
    It is possible to further reduce the
    number of comparisons in schedule;
    I have changes locally that reduce the
    number to about 25,000 during make.bash.
    However, the changes are increasingly
    complex and arcane, and reduce in much less
    code churn. Given that the goal is stability,
    that suggests that this is a reasonable
    place to stop, at least for now.
