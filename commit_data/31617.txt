    cmd/internal/obj: avoid duplicate file name symbols
    
    The meaning of Version=1 was overloaded: it was reserved for file name
    symbols (to avoid conflicts with non-file name symbols), but was also
    used to mean "give me a fresh version number for this symbol."
    
    With the new inlining tree, the same file name symbol can appear in
    multiple entries, but each one would become a distinct symbol with its
    own version number.
    
    Now, we avoid duplicating symbols by using Version=0 for file name
    symbols and we avoid conflicts with other symbols by prefixing the
    symbol name with "gofile..".
