    net/mail: move RFC 2047 code to internal/mime
    
    The code concerning quoted-printable encoding (RFC 2045) and its
    variant for MIME headers (RFC 2047) is currently spread in
    mime/multipart and net/mail. It is also not exported.
    
    This commit is the second step to fix that issue. It moves the
    RFC 2047 encoding and decoding functions from net/mail to
    internal/mime. The exported API is unchanged.
    
    Updates #4943
