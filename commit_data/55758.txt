    runtime: move cgo traceback into unwinder
    
    Currently, gentraceback's loop ends with a call to tracebackCgoContext
    to process cgo frames. This requires spreading various parts of the
    printing and pcbuf logic across these two functions.
    
    Clean this up by moving cgo unwinding into unwinder and then lifting
    the printing and pcbuf logic from tracebackCgoContext into
    gentraceback along with the other printing and pcbuf logic.
    
    Updates #54466.
