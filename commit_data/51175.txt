    net: remove erroneous Dial check in TestListenerClose
    
    TestListenerClose had been asserting that a Dial to the newly-closed
    address always fails, on the assumption that the listener's address
    and port would not be reused by some other listener that could then
    accept the connection.
    
    As far as I can tell, that assumption is not valid: the Dial after
    Close may well connect to a Listener opened for some other test, or
    even one opened by a completely different process running concurrently
    on the same machine.
    
    Fixes #38700
