    os/exec: don't use the echo binary for a benchmark
    
    Most notably, it's missing on Windows machines. For example,
    windows-amd64-race started failing consistently:
    
            --- FAIL: BenchmarkExecEcho
                bench_test.go:15: could not find echo: exec: "echo": executable file not found in %PATH%
    
    We can also reproduce this from Linux with Wine:
    
            $ GOOS=windows go test -bench=. -benchtime=1x -run=- -exec wine
            --- FAIL: BenchmarkExecEcho
                bench_test.go:15: could not find echo: exec: "echo": executable file not found in %PATH%
    
    Instead, use the "hostname" program, which is available on Windows too.
    Interestingly enough, it's also slightly faster than "echo". Any program
    is fine as long as it's close enough to a no-op, though.
