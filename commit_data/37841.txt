    crypto/x509: revert change of article in SystemCertPool docs
    
    The words 'the returned' were changed to 'a returned' in
    8201b92aae7ba51ed2e2645c1f7815bfe845db72 when referring to the value
    returned by SystemCertPool. Brad Fitz pointed out after that commit was
    merged that it makes the wording of this function doc inconsistent with
    rest of the stdlib since 'a returned' is not used anywhere, but 'the
    returned' is frequently used.
    
    Fixes #27385
