    liblink, runtime: move all references to runtime.tlsg to tls_arm.s
    
    CL 2118 makes the assumption that all references to runtime.tlsg
    should be accompanied by a declaration of runtime.tlsg if its type
    should be a normal variable, instead of a placeholder for TLS
    relocation.
    
    Because if runtime.tlsg is not declared by the runtime package,
    the type of runtime.tlsg will be zero, so fix the check in liblink
    to look for 0 instead of STLSBSS (the type will be initialized by
    cmd/ld, but cmd/ld doesn't run during assembly).
