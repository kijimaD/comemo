    runtime: mask SSE exceptions on plan9/amd64
    
    The Go run-time assumes that all SSE floating-point exceptions
    are masked so that Go programs are not broken by such invalid
    operations. By default, the 64-bit version of the Plan 9 kernel
    masks only some SSE floating-point exceptions. Here, we mask
    them all on a per-thread basis.
