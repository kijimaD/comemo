    cmd/go: When linking with gccgo pass .a files in the order they are discovered
    
    Under some circumstances linking a test binary with gccgo can fail, because
    the installed version of the library ends up before the version built for the
    test on the linker command line.
    
    This admittedly slightly hackish fix fixes this by putting the library archives
    on the linker command line in the order that a pre-order depth first traversal
    of the dependencies gives them, which has the side effect of always putting the
    version of the library built for the test first.
    
    Fixes #6768
