    cmd/go/internal/load: fix IsMetaPackage function name in doc
    
    The IsMetaPackage function was made exported when it was moved from
    cmd/go to cmd/go/internal/load in CL 36196. Its documentation wasn't
    updated accordingly. This change fixes that, resolving a golint issue.
    
    Updates #18653.
