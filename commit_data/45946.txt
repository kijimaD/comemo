    [dev.regabi] cmd/compile: add custom expression Node implementations
    
    These are fairly rote implementations of structs appropriate to
    each Op (or group of Ops).
    
    The names of these are unknown except to ir.NodAt for now.
    A later, automated change will introduce direct use of the types
    throughout package gc.
    
    (This CL is expressions; the previous one was statements.)
    
    This is the last of the Ops that were previously handled by the
    generic node struct, so that struct and its methods can be
    and are deleted in this CL.
    
    Passes buildall w/ toolstash -cmp.
