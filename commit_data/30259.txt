    runtime: eliminate write barriers from save
    
    As for dropg, save is writing a nil pointer that will generate a write
    barrier with the hybrid barrier. However, in this case, ctxt always
    should already be nil, so replace the write with an assertion that
    this is the case.
    
    At this point, we're ready to disable the write barrier elision
    optimizations that interfere with the hybrid barrier.
    
    Updates #17503.
