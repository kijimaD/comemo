    runtime: make fastrand to generate 32bit values
    
    Extend period of fastrand from (1<<31)-1 to (1<<32)-1 by
    choosing other polynom and reacting on high bit before shift.
    
    Polynomial is taken at https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/lfsr/index.html
    from 32.dat.gz . It is referred as F7711115 cause this list of
    polynomials is for LFSR with shift to right (and fastrand uses shift to
    left). (old polynomial is referred in 31.dat.gz as 7BB88888).
    
    There were couple of places with conversation of fastrand to int, which
    leads to negative values on 32bit platforms. They are fixed.
