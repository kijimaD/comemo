    net/http: add tests covering non-GET methods for file serving
    
    ServeFile and FileServer will respond to methods such as DELETE by
    serving the file contents. This is surprising, but we don't want to
    change it without some consideration.
    
    Add tests covering the current behavior.
    
    For #59470
