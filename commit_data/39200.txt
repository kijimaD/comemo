    cmd/go: copy missing bit of documentation about code generated comment
    
    This CL attempts to restore the clarity of the original specification
    at https://golang.org/s/generatedcode that the line may appear
    anywhere. It is preferable (for human readability), and most common
    for it to be early in the file, but that is merely a convention, not
    a strict well-specified requirement. Document it as so.
    
    Background
    
    Issue #13560 was a proposal define a standard for marking files as
    generated, one that is suitable to be recognized both by humans
    and machine tools. It was accepted, and the final specification
    was documented at https://golang.org/s/generatedcode. Its text,
    copied exactly:
    
            Generated files are marked by a line of text that matches
            the regular expression, in Go syntax:
    
                    ^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\.$
    
            The .* means the tool can put whatever folderol it wants in there,
            but the comment must be a single line and must start with Code generated
            and end with DO NOT EDIT., with a period.
    
            The text may appear anywhere in the file.
    
    The https://golang.org/s/generatedcode link points to a comment
    in a very large GitHub issue. That makes it harder to find.
    Issue #25433 was opened about moving that information somewhere else.
    It was resolved via CL 118756, which added text to cmd/go documentation
    at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source:
    
            To convey to humans and machine tools that code is generated,
            generated source should have a line early in the file that
            matches the following regular expression (in Go syntax):
    
                    ^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\.$
    
    The CL description noted that "This change merely moves that
    information to a more visible place." The intention was to preserve
    the specification unmodified.
    
    The original specification was very clear that "The text may appear
    anywhere in the file." The new text in cmd/go documentation wasn't
    very clear. "A line early in the file" is not a precise enough criteria
    to be recognized by a machine tool, because there isn't a precise
    definition of what lines are "early in the file".
