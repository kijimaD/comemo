    crypto/internal/boring: don't shadow named returns
    
    In setupRSA we use named returns so that we can defer freeing of the
    boring private key and context, but were using returns of the form
    `return nil, nil, ...` which nil'd the named returns, preventing them
    from actually being freed.
    
    Update all of the returns to not shadow the named variables.
    
    Thanks to Quim Muntal of Microsoft for reporting this issue.
