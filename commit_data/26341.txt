    cmd/compile: omit write barrier when assigning global function
    
    Currently we generate write barriers when the right side of an
    assignment is a global function. This doesn't fall into the existing
    case of storing an address of a global because we haven't lowered the
    function to a pointer yet.
    
    This write barrier is unnecessary, so eliminate it.
    
    Fixes #13901.
