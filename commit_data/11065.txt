    cmd/go: fix import directory list for compilation
    
    This fixes the most annoying bug in the go command,
    that 'go build' sometimes ignored packages it had just
    rebuilt in favor of stale installed ones.
    
    This part of the code needs more thought, but this small
    change is an important improvement.
