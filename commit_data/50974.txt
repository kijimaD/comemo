    net: allow more generous slop in Fluctuation tests
    
    It appears that at least the OpenBSD kernel gets sloppier the longer
    the timeout we give it, up to an observed overhead of around 25%.
    Let's give it a little more than that (33%) in the comparison, and
    also increase the growth curve to match the actual observed times
    instead of exponential initial growth.
    
    Fixes #36108
