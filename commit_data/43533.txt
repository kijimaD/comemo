    runtime: implement addrRanges.findSucc with a binary search
    
    This change modifies addrRanges.findSucc to more efficiently find the
    successor range in an addrRanges by using a binary search to narrow down
    large addrRanges and iterate over no more than 8 addrRanges.
    
    This change makes the runtime more robust against systems that may
    aggressively randomize the address space mappings it gives the runtime
    (e.g. Fuchsia).
    
    For #40191.
