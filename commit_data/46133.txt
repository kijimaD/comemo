    internal/buildcfg: change GOEXPERIMENT to always return non-empty string
    
    Rather than returning "", we now return "," (which is a no-op). This
    ensures that the returned string always overrides DefaultGOEXPERIMENT.
    
    This fixes a bootstrapping issue where GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP was built with
    "GOEXPERIMENT=fieldtrack ./make.bash". cmd/dist sets GOEXPERIMENT=none
    during bootstrapping, which was causing cmd/go to set GOEXPERIMENT=""
    when executing cmd/compile; but then cmd/compile ignores the
    environment variable (because it's empty) and instead uses
    DefaultGOEXPERIMENT.
    
    Fixes #47921.
