    doc: rewrite references to plan9.bell-labs.com to 9p.io

 The most important thing to know about Go's assembler is that it is not a direct representation of the underlying machine.
 Some of the details map precisely to the machine, but some do not.

 Instead, the compiler operates on a kind of semi-abstract instruction set,
