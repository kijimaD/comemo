    cmd/trace: use the focustask mode for user task/region trace views
    
    The taskid mode is based on the goroutine-oriented trace view,
    which displays each goroutine as a separate row. This is good when
    inspecting the interaction and timeline among related goroutines,
    and the user region information (associated with each goroutine)
    in detail, but when many goroutines are involved, this mode does
    not scale.
    
    The focustask mode is based on the default trace view with the
    user task hierarchy at the top. Each row is a P and there are only
    a handful number of Ps in most cases, so browsers can handle
    this mode more gracefully. But, I had difficulty in displaying
    the user region information (because a goroutine can start/stop/
    migrate across Ps, and visualizing the stack of regions nicely
    was complicated). It may be doable, but it's a work.
    
    This CL surfaces the hidden focustask mode. Moreover, use it
    as the default user task view mode. The taskid mode can be still
    accessible through 'goroutine view' links.
    
    Unlike taskid-based user annotation view that extends goroutine-based
    trace view, the focustask view
