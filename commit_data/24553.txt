    cmd/go: skip external tests on freebsd-arm builder
    
    It is just far too slow.
    I have a CL for Go 1.6 that makes many of these into internal tests.
    That will improve the coverage.
    
    It does not matter much, because basically none of the go command
    tests are architecture dependent, so the other builders will catch
    any problems.
    
    Fixes freebsd-arm builder.
