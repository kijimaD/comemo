    doc/go1.12: link to ABIInternal design document
    
    The ABI changes should be completely transparent to Go code, but could
    cause linking issues in certain situations involving assembly code
    reaching across package boundaries. If users encounter linking
    problems, point them to the "Compatibility" section of the ABI design
    document, which gives some guidance.
