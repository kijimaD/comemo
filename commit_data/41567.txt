    cmd/compile/internal/syntax: improved scanner tests
    
    This is one of several changes that were part of a larger rewrite
    which I made in early 2019 after switching to the new number literal
    syntax implementation. The purpose of the rewrite was to simplify
    reading of source code (Unicode character by character) and speed up
    the scanner but was never submitted for review due to other priorities.
    
    Part 1 of 3:
    
    This change contains improvements to the scanner tests.
