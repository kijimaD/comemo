    misc/dashboard: don't update tip tag for release branch commits.
    
    This will mean that sub-repositories won't get built against the
    release branch. They are often not compatible because the subrepos
    often run ahead of the current release (e.g. go.tools is using
    new additions to go/ast, and go.net is using new things in syscall)
    so there's little point in checking them against cherrypick commits
    when they'll be tested against those commits on tip anyway.
