    testing: make the output of -v more uniform and aligned when using fixed-width fonts
    
    Delete the colon from RUN: for examples, since it's not there for tests.
    Add spaces to line up RUN and PASS: lines.
    
    Before:
    === RUN TestCount
    --- PASS: TestCount (0.00s)
    === RUN: ExampleFields
    --- PASS: ExampleFields (0.00s)
    
    After:
    === RUN   TestCount
    --- PASS: TestCount (0.00s)
    === RUN   ExampleFields
    --- PASS: ExampleFields (0.00s)
    
    Fixes #10594.
