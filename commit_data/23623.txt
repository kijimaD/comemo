    cmd/doc: submit to the punched card tyranny
    
    People use 80-column terminals because their grandparents used
    punched cards. When I last used a punched card, in 1978, it seemed
    antiquated even then. But today, people still set their terminal
    widths to 80 to honor the struggles their fallen ancestors made to
    endure this painful technology.
    
    We must all stand and salute the 80 column flag, or risk the opprobium
    of our peers.
    
    For Pete's sake, I don't even use a fixed-width font. I don't even
    believe in columns.
    
    Fixes #11639 with extreme reluctance.
    
    P.S. To avoid the horror of an automatically folded line of text, this commit message has been formatted to fit on an 80-column line, except for this postscript.
