    cmd/go: respect $GOBIN always
    
    Another attempt at https://golang.org/cl/5754088.
    
    Before, we only consulted $GOBIN for source code
    found in $GOROOT, but that's confusing to explain
    and less useful.  The new behavior lets users set
    GOBIN=$HOME/bin and have all go-compiled binaries
    installed there.
    
    Tested a few cases in test.bash.
    
    Ran all.bash with and without $GOBIN and it works.
    Even so, I expect it to break the builders,
    like it did last time, we can debug from there.
    
    Fixes #3269 (again).
    Fixes #3396.
    Fixes #3397.
