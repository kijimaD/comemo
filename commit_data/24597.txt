    [dev.ssa] cmd/compile: detect rewrite loops of length > 1
    
    Use a version of Floyd's cycle finding algorithm,
    but advance by 1 and 1/2 steps per cycle rather
    than by 1 and 2. It is simpler and should be cheaper
    in the normal, acyclic case.
    
    This should fix the 386 and arm builds,
    which are currently hung.
