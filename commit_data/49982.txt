    cmd/compile: fix case in dictPass where OMETHVALUE should become ODOTMETH
    
    When I separate out the dictionary transformations to dictPass, I missed
    duplicating a conditional that deals with OMETHVALUE nodes that are
    actually called. We create the OMETHVALUE when transforming bounds
    function reference (before we know whether that reference will be
    called), and we need to call transformDot() again to convert the
    OMETHVALUE to ODOTMETH if the reference is actually called (the usual
    case). Without this change, we leave the OMETHVALUE in, and extra *-fm
    are created and used unncessarily.
    
    Also, fixed a few places where we were missing ir.MarkFunc(), which sets
    the class of a function node properly.
