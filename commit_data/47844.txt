    cmd/compile: always zero the temporary in mapKeyTemp
    
    As we are taking its address, always zero it. In many cases the
    temporary will be optimized out. But in case it does not (e.g. -N,
    -race), this ensures it has the right liveness information.
    
    May fix the noopt builder.
