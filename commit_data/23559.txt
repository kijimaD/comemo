-TODO
-[ ] need language about function/method calls and parameter passing rules
-[ ] last paragraph of #Assignments (constant promotion) should be elsewhere
-    and mention assignment to empty interface.
-[ ] need to say something about "scope" of selectors?
-[ ] clarify what a field name is in struct declarations
-    (struct{T} vs struct {T T} vs struct {t T})
-[ ] need explicit language about the result type of operations
-[ ] should probably write something about evaluation order of statements even
-	though obvious
-[ ] in Selectors section, clarify what receiver value is passed in method invocations
