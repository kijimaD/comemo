    [dev.cc] cmd/6a, etc: fix line number accounting during #ifdef
    
    Lines beginning with #ifdef, #else, #endif were not incrementing
    the line number, resulting in bad line number information for
    assembly files with #ifdefs.
    
    Example:
    
            #ifndef GOARCH_ppc64
            #endif
            #ifdef GOARCH_ppc64le
            #endif
    
            TEXT Â·use(SB),7,$0
                    RET
    
    Before this change, the line number recorded for use in 6a -S output
    (and in the runtime information in the binary) was 4 too low.
