    test: explicitly use variables to avoid gccgo "not used" error
    
    I haven't looked at the source, but the gc compiler appears to
    omit "not used" errors when there is an error in the
    initializer.  This is harder to do in gccgo, and frankly I
    think the "not used" error is still useful even if the
    initializer has a problem.  This CL tweaks some tests to avoid
    the error, which is not the point of these tests in any case.
