    spec: remove vestiges referring to iotas being incremented
    
    https://golang.org/cl/71750 specifies iota values as indices,
    thus making them independent from nested constant declarations.
    This CL removes some of the comments in the examples that were
    still referring to the old notion of iotas being incremented
    and reset.
    
    As an aside, please note that the spec still permits the use
    of iota in a nested function (like before). Specifically, the
    following cases are permitted by the spec (as before):
    
    1) const _ = len([iota]int{})
    2) const _ = unsafe.Sizeof(func(){ _ = iota })
    
    For #15550.
