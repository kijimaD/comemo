    runtime: handle nil gp in cpuprof
    
    This can happen on Windows when recording profile samples for system threads.
    
    This CL is part of a stack adding windows/arm64
    support (#36439), intended to land in the Go 1.17 cycle.
    This CL is, however, not windows/arm64-specific.
    It is cleanup meant to make the port (and future ports) easier.
