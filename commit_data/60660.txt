    spec: clarify prose for embedded struct fields
    
    The spec says that an embedded field must be specified
    as a type name (or a pointer to a type name). This is
    explicit in the prose and the FieldDecl syntax.
    
    However, the prose on promoted methods required a named
    type (originally the term used for a "defined type").
    Before the introduction of alias types, type names could
    only refer to named/defined types, so the prose was ok.
    
    With the introduction of alias types in Go 1.9, we
    distinguished between defined types (i.e., types given
    a name through a type declaration) and type aliases
    (types given an alternative name), and retired the notion
    of a named type since any type with a name (alias type
    and defined type) could be considered a "named type".
    
    To make things worse, with Go 1.18 we re-introduced the
    notion of a named type which now includes predeclared
    types, defined types, type parameters (and with that
    type aliases denoting named types).
    
    In the process some of the wording on method promotion
    didn't get updated correctly. At attempt to fix this
    was made with CL 406054, but while that CL's description
    correctly explained the intent, the CL changed the prose
    from "defined type" to "named type" (which had the new
    meaning after Go 1.18), and thus did not fix the issue.
    
    This CL fixes that fix by using the term "type name".
    This makes the prose consistent for embedded types and
    in turn clarifies that methods of embedded alias types
    (defined or not) can be promoted, consistent with the
    implementation.
    
    While at it, also document that the type of an embedded
    field cannot be a type parameter. This restriction has
    been in place since the introduction of type parameters
    with Go 1.18 and is enforced by the compiler.
    
    Fixes #66540.
    For #41687.
