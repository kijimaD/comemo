    runtime: use canonical wireguard-go repo for procyield() linkname usage
    
    The source code quoted tailscale's development fork, which is only a
    development fork. The canonical github url is actually
    github.com/wireguard/wireguard-go, but that's really just a mirror of
    git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go, and in any case, the proper go package name
    is golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard, so just use that.
