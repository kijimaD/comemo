    doc: s/race/ethnicity/ in the Code of Conduct
    
    As agreed upon by the Code of Conduct working group, "race" may refer to
    an attempt to classify people based on "defining characteristics",
    regardless of how this people view themselves, while "ethnicity" refers
    to how people identify themselves.
    
    The Code of Conduct working group believes that the term "ethnicity"
    will be more comprehensive and inclusive, and will better serve the Go
    community.
