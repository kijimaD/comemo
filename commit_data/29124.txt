    runtime: have typelinksinit work forwards
    
    For reasons I have forgotten typelinksinit processed modules backwards.
    (I suspect this was an attempt to process types in the executing
    binary first.)
    
    It does not appear to be necessary, and it is not the order we want
    when a module can be loaded at an arbitrary point during a program's
    execution as a plugin. So reverse the order.
    
    While here, make it safe to call typelinksinit multiple times.
