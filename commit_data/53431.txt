    cmd/cgo/internal/testerrors: pass if GOEXPERIMENT=cgocheck2 is set
    
    The tests in this package are meant to check cgocheck and cgocheck2
    mode, so they're of course sensitive to whether they're set.
    Currently, the test will set GOEXPERIMENT=cgocheck2 for tests of
    cgocheck2 mode, but won't *unset* cgocheck2 mode if it's already in
    the environment for tests that expect it to be off. This means
    
      GOEXPERIMENT=cgocheck2 go test cmd/cgo/internal/testerrors
    
    fails.
    
    Fix this by removing cgocheck2 from GOEXPERIMENT if it's set and the
    test case expects it to be unset.
