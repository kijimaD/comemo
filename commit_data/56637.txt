    cmd/dist: drop remaining conditions on default cgo tests
    
    Currently, dist registers cmd/cgo/internal{test,testtls,testnocgo}
    specially, so they're opted out of "go test std cmd". It has to
    register these test packages to run in various non-default build
    configurations, but at this point they can also run with the default
    build configuration (and for test and testtls, we intentionally want
    to test them in the default configuration; this is pointless but
    harmless for testnocgo). Hence, this CL drops the special registration
    of their default build configurations from registerCgoTests and lets
    them be registered as part of registerStdTests.
