commit 47bc24091af46408814d4e4b3a596fa720c7fd80
Author: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 10 19:59:00 2019 +0000

    Revert "net: halve the allocs in ParseCIDR by sharing slice backing"
    
    This reverts CL 129118 (commit aff3aaa47f16d69efc50b6fec0ddc938176695eb)
    
    Reason for revert: It was retracted by the author in a comment on the PR
    but that doesn't get synced to Gerrit, and the Gerrit CL wasn't closed
    when the PR was closed.
