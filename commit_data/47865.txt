    cmd/asm: require NOSPLIT for ABIInternal asm functions
    
    Change the assembler to enforce the requirement that ABIInternal
    functions need to be NOSPLIT. At the moment all of the assembly
    routines in the runtime that are defined as ABIInternal also
    happen to be NOSPLIT, but this CL makes it mandatory.
    
    Updates #40724.
