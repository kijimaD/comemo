    runtime: fix correctness test at end of traceback
    
    We were requiring that the defer stack and the panic stack
    be completely processed, thinking that if any were left over
    the stack scan and the defer stack/panic stack must be out
    of sync. It turns out that the panic stack may well have
    leftover entries in some situations, and that's okay.
    
    Fixes #8132.
