    test: small cleanup of code and comments in run.go
    
    While writing CL 107315, I went back and forth for the syntax used for
    constraints of build environments in which the architecture did not
    support varitants ("plan9/amd64" vs "plan9/amd64/"). I eventually
    settled for the latter because the code required less heuristics
    (think parsing "plan9/386" vs "386/sse2") but there were a few
    leftovers in code and comments.
