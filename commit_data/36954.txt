    doc: document the lack of support for symlinks under GOPATH
    
    In an effort to help others avoid the issues I've hit due to lack of
    symlink support under GOPATH, I've added a note of warning to the
    Workspaces section.
    
    I have not changed the contents of go help gopath, because on reflection
    it seems this change alone may be sufficient.
    
    Fixes #21320
