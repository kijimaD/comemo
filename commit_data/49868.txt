    go/types: ensure that we always get a new signature in expandNamed
    
    CL 349412 introduced a bug when Checker.subst does not return a new
    signature: we were still setting the receiver to the instantiated type.
    
    I'm not sure how this could manifest in practice (other than confusing
    object strings). It's possible that I could generate a testdata-driven
    test for this, but in the interest of time I just added a test to verify
    object strings.
