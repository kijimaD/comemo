    cmd/dist: remove stale files from gentab
    
    There are several files in gentab that have a nil generator, which
    means they used to be generated, but aren't any more, so dist should
    delete them if it encounters them. However, cleaning only look for
    these file names in the small number of directories listed in
    cleanlist, and none of these files were originally generated into any
    of the directories in cleanlist. Specifically, enam.c was generated
    into $GOROOT/src/cmd/[568]l starting with CL 5620045 until CL 35740044
    and the anames[5689].c files were generated into $GOROOT/src/liblink
    starting with CL 35740044 and CL 120690043 until CL 6110. None of
    these directories even exist any more, and if these files did somehow
    exist, dist wouldn't delete them anyway.
    
    Hence, we can safely remove these files from gentab.
