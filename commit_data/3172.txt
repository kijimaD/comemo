commit 155fe7925b9decba60581669420622d9f8024feb
Author: Austin Clements <aclements@csail.mit.edu>

    Add stack frame support.  Architectures are now responsible
    for decoding closures.  There is now no notion of a current OS
    thread, though that needs to come back in the form of a
    current Go thread.  As a result, Process now implements Peek
    and Poke and maps them to any stopped OS thread, since they
    all share the address space anyways.
