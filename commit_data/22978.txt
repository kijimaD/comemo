    time: fix registry zone info lookup on Windows
    
    registry.ReadSubKeyNames requires QUERY access right in addition to
    ENUMERATE_SUB_KEYS.
    
    This was making TestLocalZoneAbbr fail on Windows 7 in Paris/Madrid
    timezone. It succeeded on Windows 8 because timezone name changed from
    "Paris/Madrid" to "Romance Standard Time", the latter being matched by
    an abbrs entry.
