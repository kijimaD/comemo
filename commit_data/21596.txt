    runtime: remove drainallwbufs argument to drainworkbuf
    
    All calls to drainworkbuf now pass true for this argument, so remove
    the argument and update the documentation to reflect the simplified
    interface.
    
    At a higher level, there are no longer any situations where we drain
    "one wbuf" (though drainworkbuf didn't guarantee this anyway).  We
    either drain everything, or we drain a specific number of objects.
