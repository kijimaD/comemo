    cmd/go: sort "no test files" test results into normal ordering
    
    The code takes care to print test results during "go test ./..."
    in the package order, delaying prints until it's that package's
    turn, even when tests run in parallel. For some reason, the
    prints about the test not running were not included in that,
    making them print out of order. Fix that, printing that result
    with the usual result printer.
    
    This is particularly noticeable during all.bash when we start
    letting cmd/dist vet packages without tests.
