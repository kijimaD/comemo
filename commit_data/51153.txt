    cmd/api: run half as many go list calls in parallel
    
    We currently run one 'go list' invocation per GOMAXPROC. Since the go
    command uses memory and has its own internal parallelism, that's
    unlikely to be an efficient use of resources. Run half as many. I
    suspect that's still too many but this should fix our OOMs.
    
    For #49957.
