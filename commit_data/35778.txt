    runtime: avoid recursive panic on bad lock count
    
    Currently, if lock or unlock calls throw because the g.m.lock count is
    corrupted, we're unlikely to get a stack trace because startpanic_m
    will itself attempt to acquire a lock, causing a recursive failure.
    
    Avoid this by forcing the g.m.locks count to a sane value if it's
    currently bad.
    
    This might be enough to get a stack trace from #25128.
