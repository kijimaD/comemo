    cmd/go: clarify promotion of C warnings to errors
    
    CL 23005 (back in 2016!) added logic to promote C compiler warnings to
    errors when running on the Go builders.
    
    CL 437298 kept the logic to promote warnings to errors on the
    builders, but dropped the explanatory message, I believe
    unintentionally. Indeed, now there isn't even a comment in the code
    explaining what's going on.
    
    This CL adds back an explanatory message to the printed output, which
    also serves as a explanation in the code as to why we're checking
    $GO_BUILDER_NAME.
