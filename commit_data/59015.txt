    runtime: model wakeableSleep.lock in the race detector
    
    Currently the flight recorder tests are failing in race mode because the
    race detector doesn't see s.lock, leading to false positives. This has
    also appeared in the trace tests. Model the lock in the race detector.
    
    Fixes #65207.
    Fixes #65283.
