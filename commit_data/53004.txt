    test,internal/testdir: don't set GOOS/GOARCH
    
    The test directory driver currently sets the GOOS/GOARCH environment
    variables if they aren't set. This appears to be in service of a
    single test, test/env.go, which was introduced in September 2008 along
    with os.Getenv. It's not entirely clear what that test is even trying
    to check, since runtime.GOOS isn't necessarily the same as $GOOS. We
    keep the test around because golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa/interp uses it
    as a test case, but we simplify the test and eliminate the need for
    the driver to set GOOS/GOARCH.
