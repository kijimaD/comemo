    cmd/distpack: sort files in standard walk order
    
    The code was sorting files in the archives entirely by path string,
    but that's not what fs.WalkDir would do. In a directory with
    subdirectory foo/bar and file foo/bar.go, foo/bar gets visited
    first, so foo/bar/baz appears before foo/bar.go, even though
    "foo/bar/baz" > "foo/bar.go".
    
    This CL replaces the string comparison with a path-aware
    comparison that places foo/bar/baz before foo/bar.go,
    so that if the tar file is extracted and then repacked using
    fs.WalkDir, the files will remain in the same order.
    
    This will make it easier to compare the pristine distpack-produced
    tgz for darwin against the rebuilt tgz with signed binaries.
    
    Before:
    % tar tzvf /tmp/cmddist.tgz | grep -C1 runtime/cgo.go
    -rw-r--r--  0 0      0       11122 Jul 13 15:00 go/src/runtime/callers_test.go
    -rw-r--r--  0 0      0        2416 Jul 13 15:00 go/src/runtime/cgo.go
    -rw-r--r--  0 0      0        2795 Jul 13 15:00 go/src/runtime/cgo/abi_amd64.h
    
    After:
    % tar tzvf pkg/distpack/go1.21rsc.src.tar.gz | grep -C1 runtime/cgo.go
    -rw-r--r--  0 0      0        1848 Dec 31  1969 go/src/runtime/cgo/signal_ios_arm64.s
    -rw-r--r--  0 0      0        2416 Dec 31  1969 go/src/runtime/cgo.go
    -rw-r--r--  0 0      0        2479 Dec 31  1969 go/src/runtime/cgo_mmap.go
    
    For #24904.
    For #61513.
