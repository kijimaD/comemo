    [dev.fuzz] testing: exit after f.Fuzz function
    
    This change causes f.Fuzz to call runtime.GoExit
    when it has finished running. This would mean that
    any code after an f.Fuzz function within a fuzz
    target would not be executed.
    
    In the future, vet should fail if someone tries to
    do this.
    
    This change also adds the missing code that would
    execute any cleanup functions added by f.Cleanup.
