    net: Implement FileListener, FileConn, and File methods for Plan 9
    
    Functions for representing network connections as files
    and vice versa, on Plan 9.
    
    Representing network connections as files is not so
    straight-forward, because a network connection on Plan 9
    is represented by a host of files rather than a single
    file descriptor (as is the case on UNIX). We use the
    type system to distinguish between listeners and
    connections, returning the control file in the former
    case and the data file in the latter case.
