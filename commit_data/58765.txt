    os: limit temp file randomness to uint32
    
    CL 516860 accidentally changed the randomness
    used in TempFile from 32 to 64 bits on 64-bit platforms,
    meaning from 10 to 20 decimal bytes.
    This is enough to cause problems in a few tests
    because it makes temporary directory names just
    a little bit longer.
    
    Limit back down to 32 bits of randomness, which is fine,
    and add a test to avoid repeating the mistake.
    
    Fixes #64605.
