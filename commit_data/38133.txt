    cmd/compile: handle TPTR32 like TPTR64 in smallintconst
    
    In preparation for followup CL merging TPTR32 and TPTR64, move TPTR32
    from the small-types fast path to the generic 64-bit fallback code so
    that it's in the same case clause as TPTR64.
    
    This should be safe, but theoretically it could change semantics
    because TPTR32 used to always be assumed to be "small", whereas now it
    will only be considered small for values less than 1<<31.
    
    This change is done in a separate CL so that it's more easily
    identified by git bisection in case it does introduce regressions.
