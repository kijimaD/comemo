commit d599accafa0ddd1a598f87c419099f82d5910004
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 14 11:17:48 2012 -0500

    time: use "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999999 -0700 MST" as String format
    
    This change shows all the information present
    in the Time value (now including fractional seconds)
    and also arranges the fields so that, within a single time zone,
    string comparison and time comparison agree.
