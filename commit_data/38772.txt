    cmd/compile: remove CLOBBERDEAD experiment
    
    This experiment is less effective and less needed since the
    introduction of stack objects.
    
    We can't clobber stack objects because we don't know statically
    whether they are live or not.
    
    We don't really need this experiment that much any more, as it was
    primarily used to test the complicated ambiguously-live logic in the
    liveness analysis, which has been removed in favor of stack objects.
    
    It is also ~infeasible to maintain once we have safepoints everywhere.
    
    Fixes #27326
