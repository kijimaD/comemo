    runtime: control background scan credit flushing with flag
    
    Currently callers of gcDrain control whether it flushes scan work
    credit to gcController.bgScanCredit by passing a value other than -1
    for the flush threshold. Shortly we're going to make this always flush
    scan work to gcController.scanWork and optionally also flush scan work
    to gcController.bgScanCredit. This will be much easier if the flush
    threshold is simply a constant (which it is in practice) and callers
    merely control whether or not the flush includes the background
    credit. Hence, replace the flush threshold argument with a flag.
