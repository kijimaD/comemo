    cmd/compile: break apart dumptypestructs
    
    dumptypestructs did several different jobs.
    Split them into separate functions
    and call them in turn.
    
    Hand dumptypestructs a list of dcls,
    rather than reading the global.
    
    Rename dumpptabs for (marginal) clarity.
    
    This is groundwork for compiling autogenerated
    functions concurrently.
    
    Passes toolstash-check.
