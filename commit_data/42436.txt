    misc/cgo/test: tweak to pass with GCC 10
    
    The test for issue 8945 was marked to only run on gccgo, but there was
    no reason for that. It broke for gccgo using GCC 10, because GCC 10
    defaults to -fno-common. Make the test run on gc, and split it into
    test.go and testx.go to make it work with GCC 10.
    
    The test for issue 9026 used two identical structs which GCC 10 turns
    into the same type. The point of the test is not that the structs are
    identical, but that they are handled in a particular order. So make
    them different.
    
    Updates #8945
    Updates #9026
