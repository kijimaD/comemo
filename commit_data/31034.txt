    cmd/go, misc: rework cwd handling for iOS tests
    
    Another change in behvaior (bug) in LLDB. Despite the fact that
    LLDB can dump the symtab of our test binaries and show the function
    addresses, it can no longer call the functions. This means the chdir
    trick on signal is failing.
    
    This CL uses a new trick. For iOS, the exec script passes the change
    in directory as an argument, and it is processed early by the test
    harness generated by cmd/go.
    
    For the iOS builders.
