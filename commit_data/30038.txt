    net/http: add NoBody, don't return nil from NewRequest on zero bodies
    
    This is an alternate solution to https://golang.org/cl/31445
    
    Instead of making NewRequest return a request with Request.Body == nil
    to signal a zero byte body, add a well-known variable that means
    explicitly zero.
    
    Too many tests inside Google (and presumably the outside world)
    broke.
