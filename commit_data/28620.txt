    net: clarify that Conn deadlines also affect currently-blocked I/O
    
    All implementations have always implemented this behavior, it's
    tested, and it's depended on by other packages. (notably, by net/http)
    
    The one exception is Plan 9 which doesn't support I/O deadlines at all
    (tracked in #11932). As a result, a bunch of tests fail on plan9
    (#7237). But once Plan 9 adds I/O deadline support, it'll also need
    this behavior.
