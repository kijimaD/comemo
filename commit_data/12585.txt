    godoc: fix codewalk handler
    
    For URLs ending with /, the handler did not work, trying to append
    ".xml" to the path.
    
    For instance, the "Share Memory by Communicating" returned the
    following error:
    
            open /Users/francisco.souza/lib/go/doc/codewalk/sharemem/.xml: no such file or directory
    
    R=adg, minux.ma
