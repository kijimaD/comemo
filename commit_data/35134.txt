    net: revert CL 82975
    
    this solution as it stands doesn't work with
    non-english device names (golang/go#23191 (which has a fix))
    and names some devices differently (golang/go#23153) probably due to the
    fact that this test previously only ran on Server 2008.
    
    Re-opens golang/go#20073
