    cmd/compile: set conversions to unsafe.Pointer as an escaping operation when -asan is enabled
    
    When ASan is enabled, treat conversions to unsafe.Pointer as
    an escaping operation. In this way, all pointer operations on
    the stack objects will become operations on the escaped heap
    objects. As we've already supported ASan detection of error
    memory accesses to heap objects. With this trick, we can use
    -asan option to report errors on bad stack operations.
    
    Add test cases.
    
    Updates #44853.
