    runtime: increase timeout in TestSpuriousWakeupsNeverHangSemasleep
    
    This change tries increasing the timeout in
    TestSpuriousWakeupsNeverHangSemasleep. I'm not entirely sure of the
    mechanism, but GODEBUG=gcstoptheworld=2 and GODEBUG=gccheckmark=1 can
    cause this test to fail at it's regular timeout. It does not seem to
    indicate a deadlock, because bumping the timeout 10x make the problem
    go away. I suspect the problem is due to the long STW times these two
    modes can induce, plus the fact this test runs in parallel with others.
    
    Let's just bump the timeout. The test is fundamentally sound, and it's
    unclear to me how else to test for a deadlock here.
    
    Fixes #71691.
    Fixes #71548.
