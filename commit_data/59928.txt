    runtime: add workaround to "throw" pending resolution of issue #67274
    
    Temporarily mark the function runtime.throw as "go:noinline" for the
    time being to work around problems introduced by CL 581215. We do not
    ordinarily inline runtime.throw unless the build is beind done with an
    elevated inline budget (e.g. "-gcflags=-l=4"), so this change should
    only have an effect for those special builds.
    
    Updates #67274.
