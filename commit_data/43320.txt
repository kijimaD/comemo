    cmd/internal/obj/ppc64,cmd/asm/internal/asm/testdata: fix up ppc64 testcases
    
    When a fix was made at the end of the last release related to
    NOPs, it was discovered that the ppc64.s testcase was out of date
    and contained comments that weren't being processed. Essentially the
    instructions in that test were being assembled but there was no
    verification that the encodings weres correct. The ppc64enc.s file
    was mostly complete and included the valid encodings for verification.
    This change moves ppc64enc.s to ppc64.s and adds the instructions
    that were missing.
    
    This also adds a minor fix to asm9.go on the assembly of the
    addex that was discovered during this testing.
