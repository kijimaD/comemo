commit 6f6ff951830a8246ce83b09b480685c0333e8f6b

    go/build: mention 'tag' as an alias for 'build constraint'
    The code is all about tags, and the cmd/go documentation
    said to look in the go/build documentation for information
    about tags, but the documentation said nothing about tags,
    only build constraints. Make things clearer.
