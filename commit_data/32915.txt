+  The <code>go-contrib-init</code> tool configures and debugs your Go
+  development environment, automatically performing many of the steps
+  on this page, or telling you what you need to do next. If you wish
+  to use it, run:
+</p>
+
+<pre>
+$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/go-contrib-init
+$ cd /code/to/edit
+$ go-contrib-init
+</pre>

+  The tool will either set things up, tell you that everything is
+  configured, or tell you what steps you need to do manually.
