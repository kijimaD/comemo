    cmd/pprof: disable readline UI support for TERM=dumb
    
    In general, dumb terminal indicates terminal with limited capability.
    It may provide no support for special character sequences, e.g., no
    handling of ANSI escape sequences. Its input/output handling behavior
    may deviate from what's described in termios or terminfo. E.g., in
    the shell in emacs, even after successfully setting the terminal to
    raw mode, the terminal behaves as if it's still operating in canonical
    mode since emacs is doing input processing first.
    
    Readline support can be broken in various ways in dumb terminal mode,
    so we want to disable readline or advanced UI features. The easiest
    way to detect dumb terminal is to check the environment variable "TERM".
    
    Fixes #26254
