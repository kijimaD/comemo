    cmd/go: support long commands in asm and cgo
    
    We have supported passing lists of arguments to the compiler and linker
    for some time, since https://go.dev/issue/18468 was fixed.
    The reason behind it is that some systems like Windows have relatively
    small limits for commands, and some Go packages contain many source files.
    
    This wasn't done for other Go toolchain programs like cgo and asm,
    as there wasn't an initial need for it. A TODO was left for them.
    The need has now arisen in the form of a bug report for a build of a
    large Go package involving cgo.
    
    Do asm as well, which could be triggered by lots of asm files.
    
    I rebuilt Go itself with some basic logging to tell if any other
    commands were being run with moderately large command lengths.
    I only found one other: gcc being invoked with 300-500 bytes.
    
    I didn't spot any length close to 1KiB, and we can't safely assume that
    a user's CC compiler supports these "response files", so leave that as
    another TODO for the future. Just like cgo and asm, we can revisit this
    if any user reports a bug on the issue tracker.
    
    Fixes #47235.
