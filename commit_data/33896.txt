    [dev.boringcrypto] crypto/internal/boring: allow hmac operations after Sum
    
    hmac.New returns a hash.Hash, which defines Sum as:
    
            // Sum appends the current hash to b and returns the resulting slice.
            // It does not change the underlying hash state.
            Sum(b []byte) []byte
    
    I've now seen two different pieces of code that make
    use of the assumption that Sum has no effect on the
    internal state, so make it so.
    
    Test in next CL in stack, so that it can be cherry-picked
    to master.
