    [release-branch.go1.9] runtime: capture runtimeInitTime after nanotime is initialized
    
    CL 36428 changed the way nanotime works so on Darwin and Windows it
    now depends on runtime.startNano, which is computed at runtime.init
    time. Unfortunately, the `runtimeInitTime = nanotime()` initialization
    happened *before* runtime.init, so on these platforms runtimeInitTime
    is set incorrectly. The one (and only) consequence of this is that the
    start time printed in gctrace lines is bogus:
    
    gc 1 18446653480.186s 0%: 0.092+0.47+0.038 ms clock, 0.37+0.15/0.81/1.8+0.15 ms cpu, 4->4->1 MB, 5 MB goal, 8 P
    
    To fix this, this commit moves the runtimeInitTime initialization to
    shortly after runtime.init, at which point nanotime is safe to use.
    
    This also requires changing the condition in newproc1 that currently
    uses runtimeInitTime != 0 simply to detect whether or not the main M
    has started. Since runtimeInitTime could genuinely be 0 now, this
    introduces a separate flag to newproc1.
    
    Fixes #21554.
