    cmd/doc: skip directories like other go tools
    
    It was skipping dirs starting with ".", but it was missing the "_"
    prefix and the "testdata" name. From "go help packages":
    
            Directory and file names that begin with "." or "_" are ignored
            by the go tool, as are directories named "testdata".
    
    Before the change:
    
            $ go doc z # using src/cmd/go/testdata/testvendor/src/q/z
            package z // import "."
    
    After the fix, it falls back to the current directory, as expected when
    a single argument isn't found as a package in $GOPATH.
    
    TestMain needs a small adjustment to keep the tests working, as now
    their use of cmd/doc/testdata would normally not work.
    
    This is the second try for this fix; the first time around, we included
    cmd/doc/testdata to the dirs list by sending it to the channel via a
    goroutine. However, that can end up in a send to a closed channel, if
    GOROOT is a very small directory tree or missing.
    
    To avoid that possibility, include the extra directory by pre-populating
    the paths list, before the walking of GOROOT and GOPATH actually starts.
    
    Fixes #24462.
