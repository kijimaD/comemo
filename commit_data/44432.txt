    Revert "encoding/json: don't reuse slice elements when decoding"
    
    This reverts https://golang.org/cl/191783.
    
    Reason for revert: Broke too many programs which depended on the previous
    behavior, even when it was the opposite of what the documentation said.
    
    We can attempt to fix the original issue again for 1.16, while keeping
    those programs in mind.
    
    Fixes #39427.
