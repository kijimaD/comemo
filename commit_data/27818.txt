    cmd/link: when dynlinking, do not mangle short symbol names
    
    When dynamically linking, a type symbol's name is replaced with a name based on
    the SHA1 of the name as type symbol's names can be very long.  However, this
    can make a type's symbol name longer in some cases. So skip it in that case.
    One of the symbols this changes the treatment of is 'type.string' and that fixes a
    bug where -X doesn't work when dynamically linking.
    
    Fixes #16671
