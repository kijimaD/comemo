    cmd/dist: delete special case for release branches without VERSION
    
    findgoversion has some logic from before the go1 release that only
    has effect when on a release branch without a VERSION file.
    
    Starting with release-branch.go1 and the go1 tag a decade ago,
    release branch have always had a VERSION file checked in.
    (The commit that adds/updates the VERSION file is what is tagged.)
    
    Since we have no need to support old branches like release-branch.r60,
    and such scenarios don't come up in modern Go, delete it to simplify
    this code a bit. Should the VERSION file situation change, we'd need
    to rework this code anyway.
    
    Fixes #42345.
