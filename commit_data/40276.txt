    net/http: make Server return 501 for unsupported transfer-encodings
    
    Ensures that our HTTP/1.X Server properly responds
    with a 501 Unimplemented as mandated by the spec at
    RFC 7230 Section 3.3.1, which says:
        A server that receives a request message with a
        transfer coding it does not understand SHOULD
        respond with 501 (Unimplemented).
    
    Fixes #30710
