    cmd/internal/obj: shuffle link.go to put declarations in original order
    
    I think the file ended up in the order of the typedefs instead of the
    order of the actual struct definitions. You can see where some of
    the declarations were because some of the comments didn't move.
    Put things back in the original order.
