commit 46ed89b7a32f2c415dc12a077e2bbc8bbf973eb9

    runtime: gdb support: gracefully handle not being able to find types
    
    The Dwarf info has the full typenames, the go *struct runtime.commonType
    has the short name.  A more permanent fix would link the two together
    but this way the user gets useable stack traces for now.
