    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: support NOFRAME
    
    In addition, this makes the arm64 prologue code generation much closer
    to the pattern used on other platforms.
    
    This passes toolstash -cmp with one exception: assembly functions that
    were declared with a frame size of -8 used to record
    locals=0xfffffffffffffff8 in the object file and now record
    locals=0x0. This doesn't affect anything.
