    cmd/compile: optimize convT2I as a two-word copy when T is pointer-shaped
    
    See #14874
    
    This change adds a compiler optimization for pointer shaped convT2I.
    Since itab symbols are now emitted by the compiler, the itab address can
    be directly moved into the iface structure.
