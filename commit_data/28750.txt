    doc/effective_go: clarify advice on returning interfaces
    
    New Gophers sometimes misconstrue the advice in the "Generality" section
    as "export interfaces instead of implementations" and add needless
    interfaces to their code as a result.  Down the road, they end up
    needing to add methods and either break existing callers or have to
    resort to unpleasant hacks (e.g. using "magic method" type-switches).
    
    Weaken the first paragraph of this section to only advise leaving types
    unexported when they will never need additional methods.
