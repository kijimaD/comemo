commit 1f0142f66f3cc570e834db03fe68ac2878cc28fc
Author: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>

    [dev.cc] create new branch
    
    This branch is for work on converting the remaining C code in
    package runtime to Go and then deleting the cc, 5c, 6c, and 8c
    directories. It is targeted to land at the beginning of the 1.5 cycle.
    
    The conversion will proceed one GOOS/GOARCH combination
    at a time; red lines on the dashboard are expected and okay.
    
    Once Linux and OS X are converted, help with other systems
    will be most welcome.
