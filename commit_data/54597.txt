    make.bash: use [[ rather than [
    
    [[ is a compound command part of the language with structure,
    whereas [ is simply a standard program with string arguments.
    The former has a few significant advantages over the latter:
    
    * Better syntax, e.g. && and || rather than -a and -o,
      as well as == rather than = for comparisons
    * No need for fork+exec to evaluate each conditional
    * Forgetting the closing token is an early parse error
    
    The only advantage of [ over [[ is that [[ is Bash syntax,
    whereas [ and "test" are portable POSIX Shell utilities.
    However, this is a Bash script, so that is not a concern.
