    [dev.cc] cmd/objwriter: add placeholder program
    
    cmd/internal/obj is the name for the Go translation of the C liblink library.
    
    cmd/objwriter is the name of a Go binary that runs liblink's writeobj function.
    When the bulk of liblink has been converted to Go but the assemblers and
    compilers are still written in C, the C writeobj will shell out to the Go objwriter
    to actually write the object file. This lets us manage the transition in smaller
    pieces.
    
    The objwriter tool is purely transitional.
    It will not ship in any release (enforced in cmd/dist).
    
    Adding a dummy program and some dummy imports here so that we
    can work on the bootstrap mechanisms that will be necessary to build it.
    Once the build process handles objwriter properly,
    we'll work on the actual implementation.
