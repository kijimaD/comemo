    cmd/dist, cmd/link, internal, runtime: implement buildmode=plugin for linux/loong64
    
    According to review, buildmode=shared has unfixed shortcomings and
    should be considered legacy at this time. So only buildmode=plugin is
    going to be added for loong64 which is a relatively new platform.
