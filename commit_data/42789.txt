    cmd/compile: make GOSSAHASH package-sensitive, also append to log files
    
    Turns out if your failure is in a function with a name like "Reset()"
    there will be a lot of hits on the same hashcode.  Adding package sensitivity
    solves this problem.
    
    In additionm, it turned out that in the case that a logfile was specified
    for the GOSSAHASH logging, that it was opened in create mode, which meant
    that multiple compiler invocations would reset the file to zero length.
    Opening in append mode works better; the automated harness
    (github.com/dr2chase/gossahash) takes care of truncating the file before use.
