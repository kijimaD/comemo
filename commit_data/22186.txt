    build: restore original timeouts in run.rc
    
    The timeouts were increased in CL 2462 and CL 2510
    to work around a slowness issue when running Go
    programs on a Plan 9 machine on GCE.
    
    Since we figured out this issue, we can restore
    the timeouts to their original values.
    
    Updates #10028.
