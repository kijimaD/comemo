    runtime: clear Defer.panic before removing from G.defer list
    
    Another dangling stack pointer in a cached structure.
    Same as SudoG.elem and SudoG.selectdone.
    
    Definitely a fix, and the new test in freedefer makes the
    crash reproducible, but probably not a complete fix.
    I have seen one dangling pointer in a Defer.panic even
    after this fix; I cannot see where it could be coming from.
    
    I think this will fix the solaris build.
    I do not think this will fix the occasional failure on the darwin build.
