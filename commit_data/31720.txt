    strings: document Split{,N,After,AfterN} edge cases
    
    Apparently people get confused by the fact that
    
      Split("", ",")
    
    returns []{""} instead of []{}.
    
    This is actually just a consequence of the fact that if the separator
    sep (2nd argument) is not found the string s (1st argument), then the
    Split* functions return a length 1 slice with the string s in it.
    
    Document the general case: if sep is not in s, what you get is a len 1
    slice with s in it; unless both s and sep are "", in that case you get
    an empty slice of length 0.
    
    Fixes #19726
