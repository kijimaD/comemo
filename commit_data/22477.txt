    fmt: empty byte slices should print nothing in hex
    
    The documentation is clear that formats like %02x applied to a
    byte slice are per-element, so the result should be nothing if the
    slice is empty. It's not, because the top-level padding routine is called.
    It shouldn't be: the loop does the padding for us.
    
    Fixes #10430.
