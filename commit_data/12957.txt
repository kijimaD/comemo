    exp/locale/collate: implementation of trie that is used for detecting contractions.
    (See http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Contractions.)  Each rune that is at the
    start of any contraction is associated a trie. This trie, in turn, may be shared
    by other runes that have the same set of suffixes.
