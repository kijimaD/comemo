    runtime: use timer.lock in modtimer
    
    Continue using timer.lock to simplify timer operations.
    
    Note the removal of a previous potential deadlock.
    (Explained at new line 325, there was a lock inversion
    between individual timer locks and the 'timers' lock.)
    
    [This is one CL in a refactoring stack making very small changes
    in each step, so that any subtle bugs that we miss can be more
    easily pinpointed to a small change.]
