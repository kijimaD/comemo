    cmd/compile: avoid copying in nilcheckelim2
    
    nilcheckelim2 cleans up by copying b.Values in a loop, omitting
    OpUnknowns. However, the common case is that there are no OpUnknowns,
    in which case we can skip a lot of work.
    
    So we track the first nilcheck which was eliminated, if any, and only
    start copying from there. If no nilcheck was eliminated we won't copy at all.
    
    Fixes #20964
