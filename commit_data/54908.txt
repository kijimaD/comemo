    cmd/internal/obj/arm64: fix frame pointer restore in epilogue
    
    For leaf but nonzero-frame functions.
    
    Currently we're not restoring it properly. We also need to restore
    it before popping the stack frame, so that the frame won't get
    clobbered by a signal handler in the meantime.
    
    Fixes #63830
    
    Needs a test, but I'm not at all sure how we would actually do that. Leaving for inspiration.
