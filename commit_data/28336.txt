    cmd/compile: fix tuple-generating flag ops as clobbering flags
    
    If an op generates a tuple, and part of that tuple is of flags type,
    then treat the op as clobbering flags.
    
    Normally this doesn't matter because we do:
    
    v1 = ADDS        <int32, flags>
    v2 = Select0 v1  <int32>
    v3 = Select1 v1  <flags>
    
    And v3 will do the right clobbering of flags.  But in the rare
    cases where we issue a tuple-with-flag op and the flag portion
    is dead, then we never issue a Select1.  But v1 still clobbers flags,
    so we need to respect that.
    
    Fixes builder failure in CL 28950.
