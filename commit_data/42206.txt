    cmd/compile: rename issafepoint -> hasStackMap
    
    Currently, this function conflates two (easily conflated!) concepts:
    whether a Value is a safe-point and whether it has a stack map. In
    particular, call Values may not be a safe-point, but may need a stack
    map anyway in case the called function grows the stack.
    
    Hence, rename this function to "hasStackMap", since that's really what
    it represents.
    
    For #36365.
