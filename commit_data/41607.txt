    [dev.link] cmd/internal/obj, cmd/link: use aux symbol for DWARF symbols
    
    Use the auxiliary symbol mechanism to connect the text symbol and
    its associated DWARF symbols. This way, the linker can track the
    DWARF symbols from the text symbol, without looking up special
    names.
    
    Currently, in the linker this is only used in the deadcode pass
    to track which DWARF symbols are used and need to load. Later
    passes still use name lookup for now.
