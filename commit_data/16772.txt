commit 2254785c3e691cc95d84cca4864d20b6815f25d7

    cmd/gc: tweak interface satisfaction error message
    
    "M requires pointer receiver" can be misinterpreted to
    mean that method M should have a pointer receiver but
    does not. In fact the message means "M has a pointer
    receiver" (and you don't have a pointer).
    
    Fixes #5891.
