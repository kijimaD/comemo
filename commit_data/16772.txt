    cmd/gc: tweak interface satisfaction error message
    
    "M requires pointer receiver" can be misinterpreted to
    mean that method M should have a pointer receiver but
    does not. In fact the message means "M has a pointer
    receiver" (and you don't have a pointer).
    
    Fixes #5891.
