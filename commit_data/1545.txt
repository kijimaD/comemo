commit 1b3299ed0beb81066ea2baef3bd9eaf9428c3d11
Author: Rob Pike <r@golang.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 23 12:40:55 2009 -0800

    change the representation of arrays in protobufs from *[]item to []item.
    for simplicity of user's code, optional arrays of bytes also don't have a pointer.
    requires adding a "Set()" method to arrays in reflect.
    still to do: protocol compilers, google/net/rpc.
