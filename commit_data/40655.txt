    cmd/internal/obj/mips: mark unsafe points
    
    For async preemption, we will be using REGTMP as a temporary
    register in injected call on MIPS, which will clobber it. So any
    code that uses REGTMP is not safe for async preemption.
    
    In the assembler backend, we expand a Prog to multiple machine
    instructions and use REGTMP as a temporary register if necessary.
    These need to be marked unsafe. In fact, most of the
    multi-instruction Progs use REGTMP, so we mark all of them,
    except ones that are whitelisted.
