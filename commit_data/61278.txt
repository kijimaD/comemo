+[Transport]'s limit on 1xx informational responses received
+in response to a request has changed.
+It previously aborted a request and returned an error after
+receiving more than 5 1xx responses.
+It now returns an error if the total size of all 1xx responses
+exceeds the [Transport.MaxResponseHeaderBytes] configuration setting.
+
+In addition, when a request has a
+[net/http/httptrace.ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse]
+trace hook, there is now no limit on the total number of 1xx responses.
+The `Got1xxResponse` hook may return an error to abort a request.
