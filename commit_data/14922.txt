    cmd/gc: fix handling of struct padding in hash/eq.
    
    The test case of issue 4585 was not passing due to
    miscalculation of memequal args, and the previous fix
    does not handle padding at the end of a struct.
    
    Handling of padding at end of structs also fixes the case
    of [n]T where T is such a padded struct.
    
    Fixes #4585.
    (again)
