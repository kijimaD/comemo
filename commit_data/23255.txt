    cmd/go: simplify ELF note reading and enable during bootstrap
    
    The bootstrap restriction is to avoid needing cgo for package net.
    There's no problem with building debug/elf and debug/dwarf,
    so do that.
    
    An upcoming CL is going to add more note processing code,
    and it simplifies things not to have to think about the code being
    missing half the time.
