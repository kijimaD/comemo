    net: never probe IPv4 map support on DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD
    
    DragonFly BSD and OpenBSD do not implement mapping IPv4 addresses to
    the IPv6 address space, and a runtime check can be avoided.
    
    As the IP stack capabilities probe was only being called from
    supportsIPv4map to check for this support, the OS-specific handling
    can be added to this function rather than continuing to run the probe.
