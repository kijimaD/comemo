    go/build: add dependency test
    
    This exercises the Import function but more importantly
    gives us a place to write down the policy for dependencies
    within the Go tree.  It also forces us to look at the dependencies,
    which may lead to adjustments.
    
    Surprises:
     - go/doc imports text/template, for HTMLEscape (could fix)
     - it is impossible to use math/big without fmt (unfixable)
     - it is impossible to use crypto/rand without math/big (unfixable)
