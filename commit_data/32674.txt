    cmd/link: don't generate runtime.text twice for buildmode=plugin on darwin
    
    https://golang.org/cl/29394 changed to include runtime.text and
    runtime.etext in ctxt.Textp as a work around.
    But it seems that the CL forgot to change genasmsym.
    As a result, we are generating runtime.text and runtime.etext twice.
