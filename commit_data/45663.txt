    cmd/go: add GOVCS setting to control version control usage
    
    The go command runs commands like git and hg to download modules.
    In the past, we have had problems with security bugs in version
    control systems becoming security bugs in “go get”.
    
    The original modules draft design removed use of these commands
    entirely, saying:
    
    > We want to move away from invoking version control tools such as bzr,
    > fossil, git, hg, and svn to download source code. These fragment the
    > ecosystem: packages developed using Bazaar or Fossil, for example, are
    > effectively unavailable to users who cannot or choose not to install
    > these tools. The version control tools have also been a source of
    > exciting security problems. It would be good to move them outside the
    > security perimeter.
    
    The removal of these commands was not possible in the end: being able
    to fetch directly from Git repos is too important, especially for
    closed source. But the security exposure has not gone away.
    We remain vulnerable to problems in VCS systems, especially the less
    scrutinized ones.
    
    This change adds a GOVCS setting to let users control which version
    control systems are allowed by default.
    
    It also changes the default allowed version control systems to git and hg
    for public code and any version control system for private code
    (import path or module path matched by the GOPRIVATE setting).
    
    See the changes in alldocs.go for detailed documentation.
    See #41730 for proposal and discussion.
    
    Fixes #41730.
