    test/run: make errorcheck tests faster
    
    Some of the errorcheck tests have many many identical regexps.
    Use a map to avoid storing the compiled form many many times
    in memory. Change the filterRe to a simple string to avoid
    the expense of those regexps as well.
    
    Cuts the time for run.go on index2.go by almost 50x.
    
    Noticed during debugging of issue 7344.
