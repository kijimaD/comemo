commit 5a54696d78003a1e5c17ea9d818dc00e85624c2c
Author: Keith Randall <khr@golang.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 7 10:23:24 2013 -0700

    cmd/ld: Put the textflag constants in a separate file.
    We can then include this file in assembly to replace
    cryptic constants like "7" with meaningful constants
    like "(NOPROF|DUPOK|NOSPLIT)".
    
    Converting just pkg/runtime/asm*.s for now.  Dropping NOPROF
    and DUPOK from lots of places where they aren't needed.
    More .s files to come in a subsequent changelist.
    
    A nonzero number in the textflag field now means
    "has not been converted yet".
