commit 89d334ffe1fe7667505033f4ca49ff50954d9e7e

    ld: don't attempt to build dynamic sections unnecessarily
    
    This prevents ld from generating zeroed symtab entries for
    sections that aren't going to be generated because dynamic
    linkage has been disabled (-d was used or no dynamic libs
    were seen).  Even though they were not explicitly added by
    doelf, the section creation process was making them
    reachable again.
    
    The windows head is being disconsidered for this because
    apparently it's not taking into account debug['d'].
    
    This makes elflint 0.1% happier.
