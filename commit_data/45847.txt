    database/sql: fix deadlock test in prepare statement
    
    The issue go#46783 correctly diagnosed the context timeout
    caused an intermittent failure when the context was canceled
    prior to the BeginTx call. However due to the asynchronous nature
    of canceling a Tx through a context on fast systems, the tx.Prepare
    also succeeded. On slower systems or if a time.Sleep was inserted
    between the BeginTx and Prepare, the Prepare would fail.
    
    Resolve this by moving the context cancel after the Prepare.
    This will still trigger the deadlock which I tested locally.
    In addition, I interspersed multiple time.Sleep calls and the
    test still functioned.
    
    Fixes #46852
