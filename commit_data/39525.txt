    cmd/go: include GOEXPERIMENT flags in tool id for cache key
    
    The go command invokes each tool with -V=full to discover its version
    to compute a tool id. For release versions (that don't include the
    word "devel"), the go command only used the third word in
    the output (e.g., "go1.13"), ignoring any toolchain experiments that
    followed. With this change, the go command will use whole version line
    in the tool id for release versions.
    
    Also, when -V=full is set and there are non-default experiments,
    experiments are no longer printed twice.
    
    Fixes #33091
