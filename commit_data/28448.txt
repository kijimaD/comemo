    runtime: pass gcWork to scanstack
    
    Currently scanstack obtains its own gcWork from the P for the duration
    of the stack scan and then, if called during mark termination,
    disposes the gcWork.
    
    However, this means that the number of workbufs allocated will be at
    least the number of stacks scanned during mark termination, which may
    be very high (especially during a STW GC). This happens because, in
    steady state, each scanstack will obtain a fresh workbuf (either from
    the empty list or by allocating it), fill it with the scan results,
    and then dispose it to the full list. Nothing is consuming from the
    full list during this (and hence nothing is recycling them to the
    empty list), so the length of the full list by the time mark
    termination starts draining it is at least the number of stacks
    scanned.
    
    Fix this by pushing the gcWork acquisition up the stack to either the
    gcDrain that calls markroot that calls scanstack (which batches across
    many stack scans and is the path taken during STW GC) or to newstack
    (which is still a single scanstack call, but this is roughly bounded
    by the number of Ps).
    
    This fix reduces the workbuf allocation for the test program from
    issue #15319 from 213 MB (roughly 2KB * 1e5 goroutines) to 10 MB.
    
    Fixes #15319.
    
    Note that there's potentially a similar issue in write barriers during
    mark 2. Fixing that will be more difficult since there's no broader
    non-preemptible context, but it should also be less of a problem since
    the full list is being drained during mark 2.
    
    Some overall improvements in the go1 benchmarks, plus the usual noise.
    No significant change in the garbage benchmark (time/op or GC memory).
