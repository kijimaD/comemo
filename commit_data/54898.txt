    crypto/rsa: deprecate and de-optimize multi-prime RSA
    
    I have never encountered multi-prime RSA in the wild. A GitHub-wide
    search reveals exactly two explicit uses of it (and a couple of tools
    that leave the number configurable but defaulting to two).
    
    https://github.com/decred/tumblebit/blob/31898baea/puzzle/puzzlekey.go#L38
    https://github.com/carl-mastrangelo/pixur/blob/95d4a4208/tools/genkeys/genkeys.go#L13
    
    Multi-prime RSA has a slight performance advantage, but has limited
    compatibility and the number of primes must be chosen carefully based on
    the key size to avoid security issues. It also requires a completely
    separate and rarely used private key operation code path, which if buggy
    or incorrect would leak the private key.
    
    Mark it as deprecated, and remove the dedicated CRT optimization,
    falling back instead to the slower but safer non-CRT fallback.
