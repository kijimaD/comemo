    runtime: make the lock rank DAG make more sense
    
    This groups, comments, and generally reorganizes the lock rank graph
    description by subsystem. It also introduces several pseudo-nodes that
    more cleanly describe the inherent layering of lock ranks by
    subsystem.
    
    I believe this doesn't actually change the graph, but haven't verified
    this.
    
    For #53789.
