    doc/go1.14: disable text/template processing in HTML page
    
    HTML pages served by the website have the option to opt-in to template
    processing, by including "Template: true" in the page metadata.
    This functionality is documented at
    https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/403f1254bdfd3da27c92a0e9e37dd180a9a82b3c/godoc/template.go#L5-L30.
    
    Historically, the Go 1 release notes have used template processing
    to a great extent, but release notes for all subsequent major Go
    releases have not.
    
    Since this feature is generally not used and not very well known,
    it tends to do more harm than good by making it possible for errors
    in the template to prevent the release notes from showing up at all.
    
    Disable this feature for Go 1.14 release notes and onwards.
    We can consider enabling it when there's a stronger need for it.
    
    Fixes #37072
    Updates #37070
