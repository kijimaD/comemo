    cmd/dist: improve isGitRepo to handle git "worktree"s
    
    Simply checking the exit code of `git rev-parse --git-dir` should
    suffice here, but that requires deviating from the infrastructure
    provided by `run`, so I've left that for a future change.
    
    Originally by Tamir Duberstein but updated by iant & rsc to add
    the filepath.Join logic.
    
    Fixes #11211 (again).
