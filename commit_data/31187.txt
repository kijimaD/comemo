    encoding/hex: change lookup table back to string
    
    CL 27254 changed hextable to a byte array for performance.
    CL 28219 fixed the compiler so that that is no longer necessary.
    As Kirill notes in #15808, a string is preferable
    as the linker can easily de-dup it.
    So go back. No performance changes.
