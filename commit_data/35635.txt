    cmd/cover: fix TestCoverHTML on Plan 9
    
    CL 116975 added TestCoverHTML. However, this test is failing
    on Plan 9, because the GNU diff tool is called "ape/diff"
    instead of "diff" on Plan 9.
    
    This change replaces the "diff" command by the "ape/diff"
    command on Plan 9.
    
    Fixes #25795.
