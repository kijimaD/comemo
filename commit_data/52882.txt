    runtime: skip TestGdbBacktrace on gdb bug
    
    Very rarely, GDB will successfully run the whole test and the inferior
    will exit successfully, and then GDB itself hangs and never exits.
    Detect this and skip the test as flaky. We could just continue the
    test since all of the output we need is there, but by skipping it
    we're less likely to notice serious regressions in this test.
    
    Fixes #37405.
