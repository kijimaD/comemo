    cmd/link: improve error for missing SDYNIMPORT support on mips/mips64
    
    Issue an error (instead of crashing) when encountering a symbol that
    requires dynamic relocations on mips/mips64. The dynimport support is
    in progress, but is not done yet, so rather than crashing, print a
    message indicating that the feature is not yet implemented and exit.
    
    Fixes #58240.
