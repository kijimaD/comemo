    cmd/go: in 'go list -m', ignore "not found" errors loading updates
    
    "Not found" and "no matching version" errors usually indicate the user
    is offline or the proxy doesn't have a version of go.mod that could
    provide retractions. 'go list -m -u' should still succeed.
    
    We should still report unclassified errors though. Previously, we
    reported most errors loading retractions but did not report errors
    loading updates. This change makes those operations more consistent.
    
    Fixes #45305
