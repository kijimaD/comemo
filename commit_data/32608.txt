    cmd/asm: enable MOVSD in the encoding end-to-end test
    
    MOVSD is properly handled but its encoding test wasn't enabled. Enable
    it.
    
    For reference this was found with a little tool I wrote [1] to explore
    which instructions are missing or not tested in the go obj package and
    assembler:
    
    "which SSE2 instructions aren't tested? And don't list instructions
    which can take MMX operands"
    
    $ x86db-gogen list --extension SSE2 --not-tested --not-mmx
    CLFLUSH mem           [m:  np 0f ae /7] WILLAMETTE,SSE2
    MOVSD   xmmreg,xmmreg [rm: f2 0f 10 /r] WILLAMETTE,SSE2
    MOVSD   xmmreg,xmmreg [mr: f2 0f 11 /r] WILLAMETTE,SSE2
    MOVSD   mem64,xmmreg  [mr: f2 0f 11 /r] WILLAMETTE,SSE2
    MOVSD   xmmreg,mem64  [rm: f2 0f 10 /r] WILLAMETTE,SSE2
    
    (CLFLUSH was introduced with SSE2, but has its own CPUID bit)
