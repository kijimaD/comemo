    go/printer: leave indentation alone when printing nodes from different files
    
    ASTs may be created by various tools and built from nodes of
    different files. An incorrectly constructed AST will likely
    not print at all, but a (structurally) correct AST with bad
    position information should still print structurally correct.
    
    One heuristic used was to reset indentation when the filename
    in the position information of nodes changed. However, this
    can lead to wrong indentation for structurally correct ASTs.
    
    Fix: Don't change the indentation in this case.
    
    Related to issue 4300.
