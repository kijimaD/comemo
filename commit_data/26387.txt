    runtime: fix sleep/wakeup race for GC assists
    
    GC assists check gcBlackenEnabled under the assist queue lock to avoid
    going to sleep after gcWakeAllAssists has already woken all assists.
    However, currently we clear gcBlackenEnabled shortly *after* waking
    all assists, which opens a window where this exact race can happen.
    
    Fix this by clearing gcBlackenEnabled before waking blocked assists.
    However, it's unlikely this actually matters because the world is
    stopped between waking assists and clearing gcBlackenEnabled and there
    aren't any obvious allocations during this window, so I don't think an
    assist could actually slip in to this race window.
    
    Updates #13645.
