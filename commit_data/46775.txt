    cmd/go: skip issue33139 when the 'cc' script command is unavailable
    
    With CGO disabled, the test suite tries to run the following and fail:
    
    CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run=TestScript/link_syso_issue33139 cmd/go
    go test proxy running at GOPROXY=http://127.0.0.1:38829/mod
    --- FAIL: TestScript (0.01s)
        --- FAIL: TestScript/link_syso_issue33139 (0.01s)
            script_test.go:215:
                # Test that we can use the external linker with a host syso file that is
                # embedded in a package, that is referenced by a Go assembly function.
                # See issue 33139. (0.000s)
                # External linking is not supported on linux/ppc64.

                > [linux] [riscv64] skip
                > cc -c -o syso/objTestImpl.syso syso/src/objTestImpl.c
                FAIL: testdata/script/link_syso_issue33139.txt:15:
                    unexpected error starting command:
                            fork/exec /dev/null: permission denied
    
    CC was set to /dev/null (during build) in the scenario mentioned above
    
    This patch replaces [!exec:cc] with [!cgo] because we care about the
    availability of the 'cc' builtin and not the 'cc' executable in $PATH
