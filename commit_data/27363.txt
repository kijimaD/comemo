    net/http: document ResponseWriter read-vs-write concurrency rules
    
    Summary: Go's HTTP/1.x server closes the request body once writes are
    flushed. Go's HTTP/2 server supports concurrent read & write.
    
    Added a TODO to make the HTTP/1.x server also support concurrent
    read+write. But for now, document it.
    
    Updates #15527
