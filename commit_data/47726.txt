    cmd/internal/objabi: clarify initialization of Experiments
    
    Currently objabi.Experiments is set via side-effect from an init
    function, which makes their initialization process somewhat unclear
    (indeed, I've messed this up before) and opens the possibility of
    accessing them from another init function before it's initialized.
    
    Originally, this init function set several variables, but at this
    point it sets only objabi.Experiments, so switch to just using a
    variable initializer to make the initialization process clear.
