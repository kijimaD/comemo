    cmd/internal/objabi: support boolean GOEXPERIMENTs
    
    Currently, objabi exports GOEXPERIMENT flags as ints that are either 0
    or 1. Since the dawn of time, there's been a comment saying that we
    *could* support general integers here, but it's never happened and all
    the "== 0" and "!= 0" and "== 1" are driving me crazy and are making
    the code harder to read and maintain. Hence, this CL adds support for
    boolean GOEXPERIMENT flags. We'll introduce some bool-typed flags in
    the next CL.
