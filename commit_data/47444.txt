    cmd/compile: add missing method info for method with correct name except for case
    
    When being used by the compiler, augment the types2 missing method
    message with extra info, if a method is missing, but a method with the
    correct name except for case (i.e. equal via string.EqualFold()) is
    present. In that case, print out the wanted method and the method that
    is present (that has the wrong case).
    
    In the 1.17 compiler, we don't do this case-folding check when assigning
    an interface to an interface, so I didn't add that check, but we could
    add that.
    
    Fixes #48471
