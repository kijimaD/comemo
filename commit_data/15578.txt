    cmd/cgo: use explicit flag to emit dynamic linker path
    
    Using -import_runtime_cgo would have worked great except
    that it doesn't get passed to the second invocation of cgo,
    and that's the one that writes the relevant file.
    
    Fixes ARM build on systems with a different dynamic linker
    than the one 5l assumes (like Gentoo).
