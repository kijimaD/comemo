    all.{bash,rc}: use "../bin/go tool dist" instead of "%GOTOOLDIR%/dist" print build info
    
    After CL 677558, when running all.bash, the binaries of commands such
    as dist, nm, and pprof are no longer built by default, so when running
    all.bash, "./all.bash: line 13: /home/golang/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/dist:
    No such file or directory" will be printed, and the return result of
    the all.bash script is non-zero.
    
    Although the "dist" command  won't be installed in $GOTOOLDIR anymore,
    but it will be built and cached, and ../bin/go tool dist will reuse the
    cached binary.
    
    For #71867
