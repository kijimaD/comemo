    crypto/rand: remove all buffering
    
    The kernel's RNG is fast enough, and buffering means taking locks, which
    we don't want to do. So just remove all buffering. This also means the
    randomness we get is "fresher". That also means we don't need any
    locking, making this potentially faster if multiple cores are hitting
    GetRandom() at the same time on newer Linuxes.
    
    Also, change the build tag of the tests to be 'unix' instead of
    enumerating them.
