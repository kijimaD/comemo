    doc: add a link to the code of conduct
    
    GitHub has defined a set of standard meta files to include with projects
    hosted on GitHub. According to the GitHub Insights Community page for
    go project the only one missing is the code of conduct.
    
    Go has a code of conduct on it's website and we should link to it in the
    prescribed `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` so that people can find it in
    the standard location on GitHub. This would be consistent with the
    contribution guidelines that are linked to in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    
    Ref: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/
    
    Fixes #22685
