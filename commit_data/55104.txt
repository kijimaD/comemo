+We have been working inside Google on a fork of Go that uses
+BoringCrypto (the core of [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/))
+for various crypto primitives, in furtherance of some work related to FIPS 140.
+We have heard that some external users of Go would be
+interested in this code as well, so we have published this code
+here in the main Go repository behind the setting GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto.
+
+Use of GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto outside Google is _unsupported_.
+This mode is not part of the [Go 1 compatibility rules](https://go.dev/doc/go1compat),
+and it may change incompatibly or break in other ways at any time.
+
+To be clear, we are not making any statements or representations about
+the suitability of this code in relation to the FIPS 140 standard.
+Interested users will have to evaluate for themselves whether the code
+is useful for their own purposes.
