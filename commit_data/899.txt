    do not set t->recur on basic types.
    the comment talked about printing, but now
    t->recur is only used for typehash.
    in typehash it is important to compute different
    hashes for the different basic types.
    
    add test that makes sure an interface { X() int8 }
    cannot be used as interface { X() int64 }
