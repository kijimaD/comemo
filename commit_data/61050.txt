    runtime: properly compute whether PC is inside vDSO pages
    
    The old calculation just looked whether PC was within a page of a vDSO
    symbol. This doesn't work because the vDSO .text might span two whole
    pages, with trampolines and such redirecting PC around between them.
    
    This manifests itself with the new vDSO getrandom() function, where on
    PowerPC, the trampoline is quite far away from the actual C function it
    jumps into. The effect is that the signal handler doesn't know it's
    interrupting a vDSO call and forgets to restore g to R30, resulting in a
    crash.
    
    Fix this by storing the start and end of the LOAD section from the
    program headers. We could be more specific and parse out the .text
    section, but PT_LOAD is good enough and appears to work well.
